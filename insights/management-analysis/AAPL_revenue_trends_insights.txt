Executive Overview  


The Company designs, manufactures, and markets personal computers, portable digital music players, and mobile communication devices and sells a variety of related software,
services, peripherals, and networking solutions. The Company's products and services include the Mac® line of desktop and portable computers, the iPod line of portable digital music
players, iPhone, Apple TV, Xserve®, and Xserve RAID, a portfolio of consumer and professional software applications, the Mac OS® X operating system, third-party digital content
through the iTunes Store, and a variety of accessory, service and support offerings. The Company sells its products worldwide through its online stores, its retail stores, its direct
sales force, and third-party wholesalers, resellers, and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Mac, iPod and iPhone compatible products, including application
software, printers, storage devices, speakers, headphones, and various other accessories and peripherals through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to education, consumer, creative
professional, business, and government customers. Further discussion of the Company's products may be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading "Business." 


The
Company believes that for both professionals and consumers the personal computer has become the center of an evolving digital lifestyle by integrating with and enhancing the utility of advanced
digital devices such as the Company's iPods, iPhones, digital video and still cameras, televisions, personal digital assistants, and other digital devices. The attributes of the personal computer that
enable this functionality include a high-quality user interface, easy access to relatively inexpensive data storage, the ability to run complex applications, and the ability to connect
easily to a wide variety of other digital devices and to the Internet. The Company is the only participant in the personal computer industry that controls the design and development of the entire
personal computerfrom the hardware and operating system to sophisticated applications. This, along with its products' creative industrial designs, intuitive
ease-of-use, and built-in graphics, multimedia and networking capabilities, uniquely positions the Company to offer innovative integrated digital lifestyle
solutions. 


The
Company's business strategy leverages its ability, through the design and development of its own operating system, hardware, and many software applications and technologies, to bring to its
customers around the world compelling new products and solutions with superior ease-of-use, seamless integration, and innovative industrial design. 


The
Company participates in several highly competitive markets, including personal computers with its Mac line of computers, consumer electronics with its iPod product family of portable digital music
players, and distribution of third-party digital content through its online iTunes Store. With the introduction of iPhone, the Company has also begun to compete with mobile communication device
companies that have substantial experience and technological and financial resources. While the Company is widely recognized as a leading innovator in the personal computer and consumer electronics
markets as well as a leader in the emerging market for distribution of digital content, these markets are highly competitive and subject to 


36








 




aggressive
pricing. To remain competitive, the Company believes that increased investment in research and development ("R&D") and marketing and advertising is necessary to maintain or expand its
position in the markets where it competes. The Company's R&D spending is focused on further developing its existing line of personal computers, operating systems, application software, and portable
digital music players; developing new digital lifestyle consumer and professional software applications; and investing in new product areas such as iPhone and wireless technologies. The Company also
believes increased investment in marketing and advertising programs is critical to increasing product and brand awareness. 


The
Company utilizes a variety of direct and indirect distribution channels. The Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons
who can convey the value of the hardware, software, and peripheral integration, demonstrate the unique digital lifestyle solutions that are available only on Mac computers, and demonstrate the
compatibility of the Mac with the Windows platform and networks. The Company further believes providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting
and retaining
customers. To ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company has expanded and improved its distribution capabilities by
opening its own retail stores in the U.S. and internationally. The Company had 197 stores open as of September 29, 2007. 


The
Company also staffs selected third-party stores with the Company's own employees to improve the buying experience through reseller channels. The Company has deployed Apple employees and
contractors in reseller locations around the world including the U.S., Canada, Europe, Japan, Asia, Latin America and Australia. The Company also sells to customers directly through its online stores
around the world. 


To
improve access to the iPod product family, the Company has significantly expanded the number of distribution points where iPods are sold. iPods can be purchased in certain department stores,
member-only warehouse stores, large retail chains, and specialty retail stores, as well as through the channels for Mac distribution listed above. 


The
Company began shipping iPhone in the U.S. on June 29, 2007, in the U.K. and Germany on November 9, 2007 and expects to begin shipping the iPhone in France on November 29,
2007. AT&T Mobility LLC ("AT&T"), O2 Limited ("O2"), T-Mobile International AG & Co. KG ("T-Mobile"), and France Telecom ("Orange") are the exclusive cellular network
carriers for iPhone in the U.S., U.K., Germany, and France, respectively. iPhone is distributed through the Company and its exclusive cellular network carriers' distribution channels. 


Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  


The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company's discussion and analysis of
its financial condition and operating results require the Company's management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements
and accompanying notes. Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K describes the significant
accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it
believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these
estimates and such differences may be material. 


Management
believes the Company's critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation and inventory purchase
commitments, warranty costs, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these critical policies because they are both important to the portrayal of
the Company's financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments 


37








 




and
estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company's senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the
Company's Board of Directors. 


Revenue Recognition  


Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, music products, digital content, peripherals, and service and support contracts. The Company
recognizes revenue for software products (operating system software and applications software), or any product that is considered to be software-related in accordance with the guidance in Emerging
Issues Task Force ("EITF") No. 03-5, 
Applicability of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2 to Non-software Deliverables in an Arrangement
Containing More-Than-Incidental Software
, (e.g., Mac computers, iPod portable digital music players and iPhone) pursuant to American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA") Statement of Position ("SOP") No. 97-2, 
Software Revenue Recognition
, as amended. For products
that are not software or software-related, (e.g., digital content sold on the iTunes Store and certain Mac, iPod and iPhone supplies and accessories) the Company recognizes revenue pursuant to SEC
Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 104, 
Revenue Recognition.


The
Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered
delivered to the customer once it has been shipped, and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Company's product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is
shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the
Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed not to be, fixed or
determinable, revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met. 


During
2007, the Company began shipping Apple TV and iPhone. For both Apple TV and iPhone, the Company indicated it may provide future unspecified features and additional software products free of
charge to customers. Therefore, sales of Apple TV and iPhone handsets are recognized under subscription accounting in accordance with SOP No. 97-2. The Company recognizes the
associated revenue and cost of goods sold on a straight-line basis over the currently estimated 24-month economic lives of these products with any loss recognized at the
time of sale. Costs incurred by the Company for engineering, sales, marketing and warranty are expensed as incurred. 


The
Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other
sales programs and volume-based incentives. For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be
reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. If refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be
made or the price protection lapses. For customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date
at which the program is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company's historical experience. Future market conditions and product
transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such
programs are offered. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience and
the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives, the Company 


38








 




would
be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have a negative impact on the Company's results of operations. 


Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  


The Company distributes its products through third-party distributors and resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and commercial customers. The Company generally
does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible the Company does attempt to limit
credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Australia by arranging with third-party financing companies to provide flooring
arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the Company's direct customers. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As
such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral,
third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Company's distribution and retail channel partners. 


The
allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management's assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition
of those specific customers. The Company records an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that is reasonably believed to be collectible. The Company also records an allowance for
all other trade receivables based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debt, the general economic environment, the financial condition of the Company's distribution channels,
and the
aging of such receivables. If there is a deterioration of a major customer's financial condition, if the Company becomes aware of additional information related to the credit worthiness of a major
customer, or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the Company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts, which would
affect earnings in the period the adjustments were made. 


Inventory Valuation and Inventory Purchase Commitments  


The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. The Company records a write-down for inventories of
components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed
review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component cost
trends. The personal computer, consumer electronics and mobile communications industries are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. If
future demand or market conditions for the Company's products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory, the
Company may be required to record additional write-downs which would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the write-downs were recorded. 


The
Company accrues reserves for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company
acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. These commitments typically cover the Company's requirements
for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Company's products or an unanticipated change in technological
requirements for any of the Company's products, the Company may be required to record additional reserves for cancellation fees that would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the
cancellation fees are identified and recorded. 


39










 
 




Warranty Costs  


The Company provides for the estimated cost for hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim
rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company's typical experience. Each quarter, the Company
reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as
necessary. For products accounted for under subscription accounting pursuant to SOP No. 97-2, the Company recognizes warranty expense as incurred. If actual product failure rates or
repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could negatively affect the Company's results of operations. 


The
Company periodically provides updates to its applications and system software to maintain the software's compliance with specifications. The estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for
as warranty cost that is recognized at the time related software revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units
delivered, the number of updates expected to occur, and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates. 


Stock-Based Compensation  


The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123 (revised 2004) ("SFAS
No. 123R"), 
Share-Based Payment
. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 123R, stock-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based
on the award's fair-value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton ("BSM") option-pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the
requisite service period. The BSM model requires various judgmental assumptions including expected volatility, forfeiture rates, and expected option life. If any of the assumptions used in the BSM
model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. 


Income Taxes  


The Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, 
 
Accounting for Income Taxes
, the
provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and
liabilities
are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be
realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. 


Management
believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the
deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the
future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in
estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations could have a material impact on
the Company's financial condition and operating results. 


Legal and Other Contingencies  


As discussed in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading "Legal Proceedings" and in Note 8 "Commitments and Contingencies" in Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is 


40








 


subject
to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a contingent liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the
amount is reasonably estimable in accordance with SFAS No. 5, 
Accounting for Contingencies
. There is significant judgment required in both the
probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. In management's opinion, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings
and claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results. However, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought
against the Company are subject to significant uncertainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the Company in
the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected.

Fiscal Year 2007 versus 2006  


Net sales during 2007 increased 24% or $4.7 billion from 2006 even though the fiscal year of 2007 spanned 52 weeks while the fiscal year of 2006 spanned 53 weeks.
Several factors contributed to these increases including the following: 







Mac
net sales increased $3 billion or 40% during 2007 compared to 2006, while Mac unit sales increased by 1.75 million units or 33%. The 33% Mac unit sales
growth rate is significantly greater than the estimated growth rate of the overall personal computer industry during that timeframe. Unit sales of the Company's portable products accounted for 62% of
the Company's personal computer shipments in 2007, up from 54% in 2006. Net sales and unit sales of the Company's portable products increased 55% and 51%, respectively, during 2007 compared to 2006.
This growth was due to strong demand for the MacBook, which increased in each of the Company's operating segments, as well as the MacBook Pro, which increased in each operating segment except Japan.
Mac desktop net sales and unit sales increased by 21% and 12%, respectively, during 2007 due to stronger sales of the iMac in each of the Company's operating segments. The Mac desktop net sales growth
was greater than the unit sales growth primarily due to a shift in desktop product mix away from the lower-price Mac Mini and discontinued eMac and toward the iMac.


Net
sales of iPods increased $629 million or 8% during 2007 compared to 2006. Unit sales of iPods increased 31% compared to 2006. The iPod growth was primarily driven
by increased sales of the iPod shuffle and iPod nano particularly in international markets. iPod unit sales growth was significantly greater than iPod net sales due to a shift in overall iPod product
mix, as well as due to lower selling prices for the iPod classic, iPod nano and iPod shuffle in 2007 compared to 2006.


Net
sales of iPhone and related products and services were $123 million in 2007. iPhone net sales include the portion of iPhone handset revenue recognized in
accordance with subscription accounting over the product's 24-month estimated economic life, as well as sales of iPhone accessory products and revenue from carrier agreements. iPhone unit
sales were 1.39 million in 2007.


Net
sales of other music related products and services increased $611 million or 32% during 2007 compared to 2006 due to increased net sales from the iTunes Store.
The Company believes this growth was the result of heightened consumer interest in downloading digital content and the expansion of third-party audio and video content available for sale via the
iTunes Store.


Net
sales of peripherals and other hardware increased $160 million or 15% compared to 2006 due to an increase in wireless networking products and other hardware
accessories, including printers and scanners, which was partially offset by a decrease in net sales of displays.


Net
sales of software, service, and other sales rose $229 million or 18% during 2007 compared to 2006. This growth was primarily attributable to increased net sales
of AppleCare Protection Plan ("APP") extended service and support contracts and increased sales of Apple branded and third-party developers' software products. 




Fiscal Year 2006 versus 2005  


Net sales during 2006 increased 39% or $5.4 billion from 2005. This increase was due in part to the fact that 2006 spanned 53 weeks while 2005 spanned 52 weeks. Several
other factors contributed to these increases including the following: 







Net
sales of iPods increased $3.1 billion or 69% during 2006 compared to 2005. Unit sales of iPods totaled 39.4 million in 2006, which represents an increase
of 75% from the 22.5 million iPod units sold in 2005. Strong iPod sales during 2006 reflected significant sales of both the hard-drive based iPod that supports video, first
introduced in October of 2005 and the iPod nano, introduced in September 2005, as well as continued expansion of iPod distribution points. During 2006, the net 




43








 






sales
per iPod unit sold decreased by 3% compared to 2005 primarily due to an overall decrease in average selling prices for all iPods as well as a shift in product mix to the iPod nano. 







Mac
net sales increased $1.1 billion or 18% during 2006 compared to 2005. Mac unit sales increased by 769,000 units or 17% during 2006 compared to 2005. These
increases were mainly due to strong demand for the Intel-based MacBook and MacBook Pro systems and reflect a shift in product mix to portable products in all of the Company's operating segments. Net
sales and unit sales of the Company's portable products increased 43% and 42%, respectively, during 2006 compared to 2005. Mac desktop net sales and unit sales both decreased by 3% during 2006
compared to 2005. The decrease in sales of the Company's Mac desktops was due to declines in sales of the Company's professional-oriented desktop products. The Company believes the decline in the
Company's professional-oriented desktop products was due to customers delaying purchases of such products in anticipation of the release of the Intel-based Mac Pro, which did not begin shipping until
August 2006, and updated software applications capable of running on Intel-based Mac computers, and the trend
toward portable computers. A slight increase of 1% during 2006 in net sales per Mac unit sold was due to a shift in mix to higher-priced portable products, partially offset by price reductions on
certain Mac systems.


Other
music related products and services consists of sales associated with the iTunes Store and iPod services and accessories. Net sales of other music related products and
services increased $986 million or 110% during 2006 compared to 2005. The increase was primarily due to increased net sales from the iTunes Store and Apple-branded and third-party iPod
accessories and services. The increase in sales from the iTunes Store stemmed from significant growth in U.S. sales and the opening of the iTunes Store in Japan during August 2005 and Australia
during October 2005. The increased sales from the iTunes Store were also attributable to the availability of videos, television shows, and feature-length movie downloads.


Net
sales of software, service, and other sales increased $188 million or 17% during 2006 compared to 2005. The growth was primarily attributable to increased net
sales of AppleCare Protection Plan ("APP") extended service and support contracts and application software, partially offset by a decrease in sales of Mac OS X. Mac OS X sales were particularly high
in 2005 due to the release of Mac OS X Tiger in April 2005. 




Offsetting
the favorable factors discussed above, the Company's net sales during 2006 were negatively impacted by the following: 







Net
sales of peripherals and other hardware declined $26 million or 2% compared to 2005 primarily due to price decreases and a decrease in net sales of displays
relating to a shift in mix from desktop to portable systems. The decrease in net sales of displays for 2006 is consistent with the overall decrease in unit sales of Mac professional desktop systems. 






Segment Operating Performance  


The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable operating segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas,
Europe, and Japan reportable segments do not include activities related to the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European
countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Retail segment operates Apple-owned retail stores in the U.S., Canada, Japan, the U.K. and Italy. Each reportable geographic operating segment and
the Retail operating segment provide similar hardware and software products and similar services. During 2007, the Company revised the way it measures the Retail Segment's operating results to a
manner that is generally consistent with the Company's other operating segments. Prior period results have been reclassified to reflect this change to the Retail Segment's operating results along with
the corresponding offsets to the other operating segments. Further information regarding the Company's operating segments may be found in Note 9,

"Segment
Information and Geographic Data" in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K. 


Americas  


During 2007, net sales in the Americas segment increased $2.2 billion, or 23%, compared to 2006. The main sources of this growth were Mac portable products, iMacs,
iPods, and the sales of third-party content from the iTunes Store. Sales of Mac portable products increased due to the popularity of the MacBook, introduced in May 2006 and updated in
May 2007, as well as the MacBook Pro, introduced in January 2006 and updated in June 2007. Sales of iMacs grew due to a shift in desktop product mix away from the Mac mini and
discontinued eMac as well as the strong reception of the new iMac introduced in August 2007. Sales of iPods grew due to increased demand for the iPod nano and iPod shuffle and the introduction
of the iPod touch in September 2007. The Company believes that the growth in iTunes Store sales was the result of heightened consumer interest in downloading digital content and the expansion
of third-party audio and video content available for sale via the iTunes Store. During 2007, the Americas segment represented 48% of the Company's total net sales as compared to 49% in the same period
of 2006. During 2007, U.S. education channel net sales and Mac unit sales increased by 14% and 18%, respectively, compared to 2006. Net sales from the higher education market grew 17% during 2007
compared to 2006, while net sales in the K-12 market grew 10% during the same period. 


During
2006, net sales in the Americas segment increased $2.8 billion, or 41%, compared to 2005. The primary contributors to this increase were iPods, other music related products and services,
Mac portable systems, and APP. Sales of iPods increased primarily due to the introduction of the updated iPod with video-playing capabilities in October 2005 (now referred to as iPod classic)
and the iPod nano during September 2005. The increase in other music related products and services was due to increases in sales of Apple-branded and third-party iPod accessories and sales from
the iTunes Store. The
increase in sales of Mac portable systems in the Americas was due to strong sales of the MacBook and MacBook Pro during 2006. The overall increase in net sales was partially offset by a decline in net
sales of desktops, displays, and Mac OS X. The decrease in desktop products and displays net sales reflects the overall shift in product mix toward portable Mac systems. Mac OS X sales decreased from
2005 since the Company had not released a new version of Mac OS X since Tiger began shipping in April 2005. During 2006, the Americas segment represented 49% of the Company's total net sales as
compared to 48% in the same period of 2005. 


Europe  


Europe segment net sales increased $1.4 billion or 33% during 2007 compared to 2006. Consistent with the Americas segment, the primary drivers of this growth were Mac
portable products, iMacs, iPods, and the sales of third-party content from the iTunes Store. Sales of Mac portable products increased due to the popularity of both the MacBook and MacBook Pro. Sales
of iMacs grew due to a shift in desktop product mix away from the Mac mini and discontinued eMac as well as the strong reception of the new iMac introduced in August 2007. Sales of iPods grew
primarily due to increased demand for the iPod nano and iPod shuffle. The Company believes that the growth in iTunes Store sales was the result of heightened consumer interest in downloading digital
content and the expansion of third-party audio and video content available for sale via the iTunes Store. 


Europe
segment net sales increased $1.0 billion or 33% during 2006 compared to 2005. Consistent with the Americas segment, these increases were a result of strong growth in iPod sales, other
music related products and services, and Mac portable systems. Sales of iPods increased primarily due to the introduction of the updated iPod with video-playing capabilities in October 2005 and
the iPod nano during September 2005. The increase in other music related products and services was due to increases in sales of Apple-branded and third-party iPod accessories and sales from the
iTunes Store. The increase in sales of portable systems in Europe was due to strong sales of the MacBook and MacBook Pro that were introduced during 2006. In addition, Europe also reported increased
sales in APP related to the increase in Mac unit sales. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in desktop and Mac OS X net sales 


45








 




during
2006 compared to 2005. The decrease in desktop net sales was due to the shift in product mix toward portable Mac systems. Mac OS X sales have decreased from 2005 since the Company has not
released a new version of Mac OS X since Tiger began shipping in April 2005. 


Japan  


Japan's net sales declined by $129 million or 11% in 2007 compared to 2006. Total Mac unit sales in Japan declined 1% during 2007. The decrease in the Japan segment's
overall net sales was primarily attributable to decreases in iPod and Mac desktop sales, partially offset by an increase in revenue from MacBooks and sales of third-party content from the iTunes
Store. The decline in net sales and Mac unit sales is partially attributable to Japan's declining consumer PC market, and the iPod sales decline
is primarily due to lower average selling prices. The Company is continuing to evaluate ways to improve the future results of its Japan segment. 


Japan's
net sales increased $287 million or 31% during 2006 compared to 2005. The Japan segment experienced increased net sales in iPods, Mac portable products, and other music related products
and services. Consistent with the Company's other segments, Japan experienced increases in sales of iPods due to the introduction of the iPod with video-playing capabilities (now referred to as the
iPod classic) and the iPod nano in October and September of 2005, respectively. Japan also experienced strong sales of the Intel-based MacBook and increased sales from the iTunes Store. These
increases were partially offset by decreases in net sales of Mac desktop products, displays, and Mac OS X. The decreases in desktop products and displays reflect the overall shift in product mix
toward portable Mac systems. Mac OS X sales have decreased from 2005 since the Company had not released a new version of Mac OS X since Tiger began shipping in April 2005. Total Mac unit sales
during 2006 remained relatively flat compared to 2005. 


Retail  


The Company opened 32 new retail stores during 2007, including a total of 5 international stores in the U.K. and Italy, bringing the total number of open stores to 197 as of
September 29, 2007. This compares to 165 open stores as of September 30, 2006 and 124 open stores as of September 24, 2005. 


The
Retail segment's net sales increased by 27% to $4.1 billion during 2007 compared to 2006. Retail segment Mac unit sales increased 56% during 2007 as compared to 2006. With an average of 178
stores open during 2007, average revenue per store was $23.1 million, compared to $22.9 million in 2006 and $21.7 million in 2005. The current year increase in Retail segment net
sales was primarily due to stronger sales of Mac portable products, iMacs, accessories and services. The increase was partially offset primarily by lower net sales of iPods and other music related
products due to the expanded availability of those products through third-party resellers. 


The
Retail segment's net sales increased by 42% to $3.3 billion during 2006 compared to 2005. Retail segment Mac unit sales increased 45% during 2006 compared to 2005. The current year increase
was primarily due to strong sales of Mac portable and desktop products, iPods, and other music related products and services. Sales of iPods increased primarily due to the introduction of the updated
iPod with video-playing capabilities in October 2005 and the iPod nano during September 2005. The increase in other music related products and services was due to increased sales of
Apple-branded and third-party iPod accessories. Mac portable and desktop sales increased due to strong sales of the Intel-based MacBook, MacBook Pro, and iMac. 


As
measured by the Company's operating segment reporting, the Retail segment reported operating income of $875 million during 2007 as compared to operating income of $600 million and
$396 million during 2006 and 2005, respectively. This improvement in 2007 was primarily attributable to an increase in the Company's overall gross margin percentage. 


Expansion
of the Retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure, operating lease commitments, personnel, and other
operating expenses. 


46








 


Capital
asset purchases associated with the Retail segment were $294 million in 2007, bringing the total capital asset purchases since inception of the Retail segment to $1.0 billion. As
of September 29, 2007, the Retail segment had approximately 7,900 employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with retail store space and related facilities of
$1.1 billion. The Company would incur substantial costs if it were to close multiple retail stores. Such costs could adversely affect the Company's financial condition and operating results. 


Other Segments  


The Company's Other Segments, which consists of its Asia Pacific and FileMaker operations, experienced an increase in net sales of $406 million, or 30% during 2007
compared to 2006. This increase related primarily to a 58% increase in sales of Mac portable products and strong iPod sales in the Company's Asia Pacific region. 


During
2006, net sales in Other Segments increased 35% compared to 2005 primarily due to an increase in sales of iPod and Mac portable products. Strong sales growth was a result of the introduction of
the updated iPods featuring video-playing capabilities and the new Intel-based Mac portable products that translated to a 16% increase in Mac unit sales during 2006 compared to 2005.

Gross
margin percentage of 34.0% in 2007 increased significantly from 29.0% in 2006. The primary drivers of this increase were more favorable costs on certain commodity components, including NAND
flash memory and DRAM memory, higher overall revenue that provided for more leverage on fixed production costs and a higher percentage of revenue from the Company's direct sales channels. 


The
Company anticipates that its gross margin and the gross margins of the personal computer, consumer electronics and mobile communication industries will be subject to pressure due to price
competition. The Company expects gross margin percentage to decline sequentially in the first quarter of 2008 primarily as a result of the full-quarter impact of product transitions and
reduced pricing that were effected in the fourth quarter of 2007, lower sales of iLife and iWork in their second quarter of availability, seasonally higher component costs, and a higher mix of
indirect sales. These factors are expected to be partially offset by higher sales of the Company's Mac OS X operating system due to the introduction of Mac OS X Version 10.5 Leopard ("Mac OS X
Leopard") that became available in October 2007. 


The
foregoing statements regarding the Company's expected gross margin percentage are forward-looking. There can be no assurance that current gross margin percentage will be maintained or targeted
gross margin percentage levels will be achieved. In general, gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued
industry wide global pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, potential increases in the cost and availability of raw material and outside manufacturing services, and
a potential shift in the Company's sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. In response to these competitive pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with
respect to its products. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company's ability to effectively manage product quality and warranty costs and to stimulate 


47








 




demand
for certain of its products. Due to the Company's significant international operations, financial results can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange
rates. 


The
Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product shipments. Because the Company's markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there
is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third-parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products or components. The Company's financial condition and
operating results in the past have been and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the Company's ability to manage its inventory levels and outstanding purchase commitments and to
respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns. 


Gross
margin percentage of 29.0% in 2006 remained flat compared to 2005. The Company experienced more favorable pricing on certain commodity components including LCD flat-panel displays
and DRAM memory and higher overall revenue that provided for more leverage on fixed production costs, offset by an increase in lower margin iPod sales and other music-related services.

Research and Development ("R&D")  


Expenditures for R&D increased 10% or $70 million to $782 million in 2007 compared to 2006. R&D expense does not include capitalized software development costs of
$75 million related to the development of Mac OS X Leopard and iPhone. The increases in R&D expense were primarily due to an increase in R&D headcount in the current year to support expanded
R&D activities, partially offset by one less week of expenses in the first quarter of 2007 and the capitalized software development costs mentioned above. The Company continues to believe that focused
investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the
Company's core business strategy. As such, the Company expects to increase spending in R&D to remain competitive. 


Selling, General, and Administrative Expense ("SG&A")  


Expenditures for SG&A increased $530 million or 22% during 2007 compared to 2006. The increase was primarily due to higher direct and indirect channel variable selling
expenses resulting from the significant year-over-year increase in total net sales in 2007, the Company's continued expansion of its Retail segment in both domestic and
international markets, and a current year increase in spending on marketing and advertising, partially offset by one less week of expenses in the first quarter of 2007.

Total
other income and expense increased $234 million or 64% to $599 million during 2007 as compared to $365 million and $165 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The
increase in 2007 is attributable primarily to increased interest received from higher cash and short-term investment balances and stronger investment yields resulting from higher average
market interest rates partially offset by one less week of interest income earned in 2007. The weighted average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents, and
short-term investments increased to 5.27% in 2007 as compared to the 4.58% and 2.70% rates earned during 2006 and 2005, respectively. The current year increase in interest income was
partially offset by higher other expense, which was primarily associated with higher foreign currency hedging expenses. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company had no debt outstanding and accordingly
did not incur any interest expense. 


Provision for Income Taxes  


The Company's effective tax rate for the year ended September 29, 2007 was 30%. The Company's effective rate differs from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35%
due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. In addition, the Company
recorded a tax benefit of $63 million due to the settlement of prior year audits in the U.S. 


As
of September 29, 2007, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $1.1 billion before being offset against
certain deferred liabilities and a valuation allowance for presentation on the Company's balance sheet. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may
be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. As of
September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006 a valuation allowance of $5 million was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of state operating losses that may not
be realized. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance. 


The
Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has completed its field audit of the Company's federal income tax returns for the years 2002 through 2003 and proposed certain adjustments. The Company intends to
contest certain of these adjustments through the IRS Appeals Office. All IRS audit issues for years prior to 2002 have been resolved. In addition, the Company is subject to audits by state, local, and
foreign tax authorities. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted
with certainty. Should any issues addressed in the Company's tax audits be resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for
income tax in the period such resolution occurs. 


Recent Accounting Pronouncements  


In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 159, 
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities-including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115
 ("SFAS No. 159"). SFAS No. 159 allows companies to choose to elect measuring
eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not required to be measured at fair value. SFAS 


49








 


No. 159
requires that unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected be reported in earnings at each reporting date. SFAS No. 159 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and is required to be adopted by the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the
application of SFAS No. 159, management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or operating results. 


In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, 
Fair Value Measurements,
 which defines fair value, provides a framework for measuring
fair value, and expands the disclosures required for fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies to other accounting pronouncements that require fair value measurements; it does not require
any new fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and is required to be adopted by the Company beginning in the first quarter
of fiscal 2009. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS No. 157, management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the Company's
financial condition or operating results. 


In
June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. ("FIN") 48, 
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes-an Interpretation of FASB Statement
No. 109
. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by creating a framework for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in
their financial statements uncertain tax positions that they have taken or expect to take in a tax return. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and is required
to be adopted by the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of FIN 48, management does not currently believe adoption
will have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or operating results.

As
of September 29, 2007, the Company had $15.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, an increase of $5.3 billion over the same balance at the
end of September 30, 2006. The principal components of this net increase were cash generated by operating activities of $5.5 billion, proceeds from the issuance of common stock under
stock plans of $365 million and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $377 million. These increases were partially offset by payments for acquisitions of property, plant,
and equipment of $735 million and payments for acquisitions of intangible assets of $251 million. The Company's short-term investment portfolio is primarily invested in
highly rated, liquid investments. As of September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006, $6.5 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and
short-term investments were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. 


The
Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital expenditures, outstanding
commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months.

Capital Assets  


The Company's total capital asset purchases were $822 million during 2007, consisting of $294 million for retail store facilities and $528 million for real
estate acquisitions and corporate infrastructure including information systems enhancements. Of the $822 million in total capital asset purchases during 2007, $87 million were not yet
paid for as of September 29, 2007. The Company currently anticipates it will utilize approximately $1.1 billion for capital asset purchases during 2008, including approximately
$400 million for expansion of the Company's Retail segment, and approximately $700 million to support normal replacement of existing capital assets, including manufacturing related
equipment, enhancements to general information technology infrastructure, and real estate acquisitions. 


Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations  


The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the Company has financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative
instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated
entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to the Company.

Lease Commitments  


As of September 29, 2007, the Company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases of $1.4 billion, $1.1 billion of which related to
the lease of retail space and related facilities. Lease terms on the Company's existing major facility operating leases generally range from 3 to 15 years. 


Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Component Suppliers  


The Company utilizes several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company's products and to perform final assembly and test of finished
products. These contract manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. The
Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of
purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments typically cover the Company's forecasted component and manufacturing requirements
for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. In addition, the Company has an off-balance sheet warranty obligation for products accounted for under subscription accounting pursuant to
SOP No. 97-2 whereby the Company recognizes warranty expense as incurred. As of September 29, 2007, the Company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party
manufacturing commitments, component purchase commitments, and warranty commitments of $3.2 billion. 


During
the first quarter of 2006, the Company entered into long-term supply agreements with Hynix Semiconductor, Inc., Intel Corporation, Micron Technology, Inc., Samsung
Electronics Co., Ltd., and Toshiba Corporation to secure supply of NAND flash memory through calendar year 2010. As part of these 


51








 




agreements,
the Company prepaid $1.25 billion for flash memory components during 2006, which will be applied to certain inventory purchases made over the life of each respective agreement. The
Company utilized $208 million of the prepayment as of September 29, 2007. 


Asset Retirement Obligations  


The Company's asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. As of
September 29, 2007, the Company estimated that gross expected future cash flows of $24 million would be required to fulfill these obligations. 


Other Obligations  


Other outstanding obligations were $50 million as of September 29, 2007, primarily related to Internet and telecommunications services and the estimated cost
related to the $100 store credit the Company offered to customers who purchased an iPhone prior to the Company's September 2007 price reduction. 


Indemnifications  


The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party
intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of
an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted
against itself or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a
material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results. 


 


 


Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    
 


Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management  


The Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and
interest rate related exposures. However, given the effective horizons of the Company's risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance the hedges
will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and
losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and,
therefore, may adversely affect the Company's financial condition and operating results. 


Interest Rate Risk  


While the Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world's leading industrialized countries, the Company's interest income and expense is most sensitive
to fluctuations in the general
level of U.S. interest rates. As such, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, the value of those
investments, as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges. 


The
Company's short-term investment policy and strategy is to ensure the preservation of capital, meet liquidity requirements, and optimize return in light of the current credit and
interest rate environment. A portion of the Company's cash is managed by external managers within the guidelines of the Company's investment policy and to an objective market benchmark. The Company's
internal portfolio is benchmarked against external manager performance, allowing for differences in liquidity needs. 


The
Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company's investment portfolio. The Company places its short-term investments in highly liquid
securities issued by highly rated issuers and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company's 


52








 




general
policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk. All highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months
or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents; highly liquid investments with initial maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase are classified as
short-term investments. As of September 29, 2007, $1.9 billion of the Company's short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years.
The remainder all had underlying maturities of less than 12 months. The Company may sell its investments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit
deterioration, or for duration management. The Company recognized net gains before taxes on short-term investments of approximately $474,000 in 2007 and net losses before taxes of
approximately $434,000 and $137,000 in 2006 and 2005, respectively. 


To
provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company's investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in
interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 29, 2007, a
hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in $16 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. As of
September 30, 2006, a similar 100 basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a $15 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses
would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity. 


Foreign Currency Risk  


In general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S.
dollar, may negatively affect the
Company's net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is also a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has
been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. 


The
Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain
firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Generally, the Company's practice is to hedge a majority of its material foreign exchange
exposures. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, and/or limited availability
of appropriate hedging instruments. 


To
provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company's foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a
value-at-risk ("VAR") model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate 3,000 random
market price paths. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company's foreign exchange portfolio due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is
not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The model assumes normal market conditions. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair
value of $12.8 million as of September 29, 2007 compared to a maximum one-day loss of $9.2 million as of September 30, 2006. Because the Company uses foreign
currency instruments for hedging purposes, losses incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures. 


Actual
future gains and losses associated with the Company's investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 29, 2007
due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and amount of interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates, and the Company's actual exposures and positions.

This section and other parts of this Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements can also
be identified by words such as "anticipates," "expects," "believes," "plans," "predicts," and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company's
actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the
subsection entitled "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition" below. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. All information
presented herein is based on the Company's fiscal calendar. The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by
law.


Critical Accounting Policies  


The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company's discussion and analysis of
its financial condition and results of operations requires the Company's management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and
methods used in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 


Management
believes the following to be critical accounting policies. That is, they are both important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results, and they require management to
make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. 


Revenue Recognition  


Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of products (i.e., hardware, software, and peripherals), and extended warranty and support contracts. The Company
recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards, including Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97-2, 
Software Revenue
Recognition
, as amended, and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, 
Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements
. 


The
Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered
delivered to the customer once it has been shipped, and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Company's product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is
shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the United States, and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product
because the Company legally retains 


20






 




a
portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed to not be, fixed and determinable,
revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable. 


The
Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other
sales programs and volume-based incentives. The estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue in the period the Company has sold the product and committed to a plan. The
Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company's historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to
increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions of revenue at the time such programs are offered. Additionally,
certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions
of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which could have
a material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations. 


Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  


The Company distributes its products through third-party resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and commercial customers. The Company generally does not require
collateral from its customers. However, when possible the Company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe and Asia
and by arranging with third-party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the Company's direct customers. These credit-financing arrangements are
directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. However,
considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral, third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Company's distribution and retail channel partners. 


The
allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management's assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition
of those specific customers. The Company records an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that is reasonably believed to be collectible. The Company also records an allowance for
all other trade receivables based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts, the general economic environment, the financial condition of the Company's distribution channels,
and the aging of such receivables. If there is a deterioration of a major customer's financial condition, if the Company becomes aware of additional information related to the credit worthiness of a
major customer, or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the Company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts, which
would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made. 


Inventory Valuation and Inventory Purchase Commitments  


The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. The Company records a write-down for inventories of
components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed
review of inventory each period that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product lifecycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component cost trends. The
personal computer industry is subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. If future demand or market conditions for the Company's products are
less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory, the Company may be required 


21






 


to
record additional write-downs which would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the write-downs are recorded. 


The
Company accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a
combination of formal purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. These commitments typically cover the Company's requirements for periods ranging from
30 to 130 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Company's products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the
Company's products, the Company may be required to record additional reserves for cancellation fees that would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the cancellation fees are identified. 


Valuation of Long-Lived Assets Including Acquired Intangibles  


The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying
amount of such an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate.
If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value. Although the
Company has recognized no material impairment adjustments related to its property, plant, and equipment or identifiable intangibles during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction
with restructuring actions, deterioration in the Company's business in a geographic region or business segment in the future, including deterioration in the performance of individual retail stores,
could lead to such impairment adjustments in the future periods in which such business issues are identified. 


The
Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
, in the first quarter of
fiscal 2002. As a result, the Company no longer amortizes goodwill but instead performs a review of goodwill for impairment annually, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. The review
of goodwill for potential impairment is highly subjective and requires that: (1) goodwill be allocated to various reporting units of the Company's business to which it relates; (2) the
Company estimate the fair value of those reporting units to which the goodwill relates;
and (3) the Company determine the book value of those reporting units. If the estimated fair value of reporting units with allocated goodwill is determined to be less than their book value, the
Company is required to estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of those reporting units in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. This
requires independent valuation of certain internally developed and unrecognized assets including in-process research and development and developed technology. Once this process is
complete, the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, can be determined. 


Based
on the Company's estimates as of September 27, 2003, there was no impairment of goodwill. However, changes in various circumstances including changes in the Company's market
capitalization, changes in the Company's forecasts, and changes in the Company's internal business structure could cause one or more of the Company's reporting units to be valued differently thereby
causing an impairment of goodwill. Additionally, in response to changes in the personal computer industry and changes in global or regional economic conditions, the Company may strategically realign
its resources and consider restructuring, disposing, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of property, plant, and equipment, identifiable intangibles, or goodwill. 


Warranty Costs  


The Company provides currently for the estimated cost for product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical experience of failure rates. Each
quarter, the Company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts 


22






 


as
necessary. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could negatively affect the Company's results
of operations. 


Income Taxes  


The Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, 
 
Accounting for Income Taxes
, the
provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax
credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected
to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. 


Management
believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the
deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the
future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Similarly, if the Company subsequently realizes deferred tax assets that were
previously determined to be unrealizable, the respective valuation allowance would be reversed, resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition,
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner
inconsistent with management's expectations could have a material impact on the Company's results of operations and financial position.

sales per Macintosh unit sold is derived by dividing total Macintosh net sales by total Macintosh unit sales. 


Fiscal Year 2003 versus 2002  


Net sales increased $465 million or 8% during 2003 compared to 2002 while Macintosh unit sales declined 3% year-over-year to approximately
3 million units in 2003. Several factors have contributed favorably to net sales during 2003 including: 







The
Retail segment's net sales grew to $621 million during 2003 from $283 million in 2002, an increase of 119%. While the Company's customers may elect to
purchase product from their local Apple Retail store rather than through other preexisting sales channels in the United States, the Company believes that a substantial portion of the Retail segment's
net sales is incremental to total net sales. See additional comments below related to the Retail segment under the heading "Segment Operating Performance."


Net
sales of peripherals and other hardware rose $384 million or 57% during 2003 compared 2002, which follows a $287 million or 74% increase in 2002 as
compared to 2001. The current year increase was primarily driven by the $202 million, or 141%, year-over-year increase in iPod net sales to $345 million. All of
the Company's operating segments experienced substantial increases in iPod net sales and unit sales during 2003. iPod sales during 2003 were favorably affected by the introduction of substantially
redesigned new models, which are compatible with both Macintosh and Windows operating systems and by the Company's introduction of its iTunes Music Store for the Macintosh operating system in
April 2003. The Company's iPod digital music player is sold by a variety of resellers, many of which do not currently market the Company's Macintosh systems. The Company has expanded this
distribution network during 2003, which has contributed to the current year increase in iPod unit sales of 146%. 




In
addition to the iPod, the increase in net sales of peripherals and other hardware during 2003 also reflects an overall increase in net sales of other computer accessories including AirPort cards
and base stations, which facilitate wireless connectivity; third party digital cameras and printers; and a number of portable computer related accessories. 



Although
total Macintosh unit sales were down 3% in 2003, unit sales of the Company's portable systems were relatively strong primarily due to the 69% or 247,000 unit
increase in PowerBook unit sales, slightly offset by a 4% or 30,000 unit decrease in iBook unit sales. The increase in PowerBook net sales of $468 million or 56% is due primarily to the success
of the Company's new 12-inch, 15-inch and 17-inch models that were introduced during 2003. The decline in iBook consumer portable sales during 2003 is primarily due
to a lower average price per unit. Portable systems represented 42% of all Macintosh systems sold in 2003 versus 33% in 2002 and 31% in 2001, which reflects an overall industry trend towards portable
systems.


The
Company's average net sales per Macintosh unit sold increased 2% to $1,491 in 2003 as a result of various changes in overall unit mix towards relatively higher-priced
PowerBook systems and an increase in direct sales primarily from the Company's retail and online stores, offset by somewhat lower year-over-year pricing on comparable Macintosh
systems for most of the Company's Macintosh product lines in response to industry pricing pressure, particularly with the Company's 




25






 






iBook
consumer portable systems. PowerBook and Power Macintosh systems accounted for 42% of total unit sales in 2003 versus 36% in 2002. 







Net
sales of software increased $55 million or 18% during 2003 compared to the prior year and reflects higher net sales of Apple-branded application and server
software and third-party
software. Net sales of Apple-branded application and server software increased due to the introduction of several new software titles during the year including Final Cut Express, iLife, and Keynote,
as well as from higher sales of software related to recent acquisitions including PowerSchool and Emagic. Growth in net sales of third-party software during 2003 was particularly strong in the
Americas Segment due to strong sales of software by the Company's online store and its Retail segment.


Service
and other sales rose $69 million or 30% during 2003 and results from significant year-over-year increases in net sales associated with
AppleCare Protection Plan (APP) extended maintenance and support services, as well as the Company's Internet related services. Increased net sales associated with APP are primarily the result of
increasing attach rates over the last several years. Increased net sales associated with Internet services are due to net sales from the iTunes Music Store introduced in April 2003 and
increased net sales of the Company's .Mac Internet service. 




Offsetting
the favorable factors discussed above, the Company's net sales during 2003 were negatively impacted by the following factors: 







Total
unit sales of desktop systems fell 15% during 2003 compared to 2002. iMac systems unit sales declined 16% from 2003 to 2002 resulting from a shift in sales away from
desktop systems in favor of portables. Also, the current flat panel iMac form factor was in the eighth quarter of its life cycle by the end of 2003 and did not experience significant enhancements
until the release of the 20-inch flat-panel iMac in November 2003.


Unit
sales of Power Macintosh systems fell 13% during 2003 compared to 2002. For the first nine months of 2003 compared to the same period in 2002, unit sales of Power
Macintosh systems decreased 24%, which is representative of the decline of Power Macintosh systems sales experienced by the Company during recent years and is also believed to be attributable to
delays in purchasing pending the release of the Power Mac G5. As expected, this trend reversed in the fourth quarter of 2003 with unit sales increasing 26% during the quarter as compared to the same
period in the prior year due largely to the new Power Mac G5, which the Company introduced in June 2003 and began shipping at the end of fiscal 2003. The decline in Power Macintosh sales over
the last several years also reflects the shift in sales to portable systems, particularly PowerBooks. In addition, the Company continues to believe that weak economic conditions over the past several
years are having a pronounced negative impact on its professional and creative customers. Additionally, some of the Company's professional and creative customers may have delayed upgrades of their
systems in anticipation of certain software vendors transitioning their professionally oriented Macintosh software applications to run natively on Mac OS X. Currently there are many applications that
run natively on Mac OS X, including Adobe's PhotoShop 7 and QuarkXPress 6; however, there is no assurance that this will result in additional sales of Macintosh systems, particularly Power Macintosh
units.


The
Company has continued to experience ongoing weakness in its U.S. education channel during 2003. Net sales and unit sales in U.S. education during 2003 were down 4% and
6%, respectively, as compared to 2002. This decline was due to a decrease in K-12 sales, partially offset by an increase in higher education sales. Net sales declined primarily as a result
of a continued shift in mix away from higher priced Power Macintosh and iMac systems towards lower priced eMac and iBook systems, although the Company did experience a significant increase in sales of
its PowerBook systems primarily to higher education customers. Portable systems accounted for approximately 43% of total unit sales in the education channel during 2003, as compared to approximately
34% in 2002. 




26






 






The
Company's one-to-one (1:1) learning solutions are a complete solution consisting of an iBook portable system for every student and teacher along with a wireless network
connected to a central server. The Company has experienced significant competition in 1:1 learning solutions and, accordingly, has experienced a lower sales price per unit, on average, in these
transactions. 


The
Company believes weakness in its U.S. education channel, particularly K-12, has been caused by multiple factors including funding pressures due to weak economic conditions, large
budget deficits in many states, and increased competition particularly for desktop computers. Although the Company has taken steps, and will continue to take steps, to address weakness in the U.S.
education channel, it remains difficult to anticipate when and if this negative trend will reverse. 







The
personal computer industry in general, and the Company specifically, continue to see relatively soft demand for their products. Sales of professional and consumer
oriented Macintosh systems remain far below levels experienced in fiscal 2000 and earlier. Difficult global economic conditions during the past several years exacerbated by the economic and political
uncertainties caused by terrorist activities and the associated international responses have clearly had a pronounced negative effect on the overall demand for the Company's products in virtually all
of its markets. Further, growth in the overall personal computer industry has slowed due to the high market penetration of personal computers and a lengthening of consumer, creative, and business
personal computer upgrade cycles. 




Fiscal Year 2002 versus 2001  


Net sales increased $379 million or 7% during 2002 compared to 2001, while Macintosh unit sales were relatively flat year-over-year at
approximately 3.1 million units. On a geographic basis, performance in the domestic market was relatively strong, especially when considering the performance of the Company's Retail segment,
which operated during 2002 exclusively in the United States. However, the European and Japanese markets remained sluggish throughout 2002. The Company's net sales in 2002 were positively influenced by
a number of factors. 







First,
net sales from software, service, peripherals, and other sources rose $248 million or 26% in 2002 versus 2001. This increase was driven by several factors
including a 28% increase in combined third-party and Apple-branded software sales; $143 million in net sales of iPod, the Company's portable digital music player that was introduced in the
first half of 2002; a 9% increase in the sale of computer accessories; and a 14% increase in service revenue caused primarily by increased revenue associated with extended maintenance and support
contracts. The growth in software revenue was primarily the result of increased sales of third-party software in the Company's retail and online stores and expansion in recent years in the number of
Apple-branded software titles.


Second,
overall unit sales of Macintosh portable systems grew by 92,000 units or 10% in 2002 reflecting a general trend in the personal computer market away from desktop
systems towards portable systems. During 2002, portable Macintosh systems represented 33% of total systems sales versus 31% in 2001 and 20% in 2000. Growth in this area has been most pronounced for
iBook, the Company's education and consumer oriented portable Macintosh system. iBook unit sales increased 14% in 2002 and 9% in 2001.


Third,
the Company's Retail segment grew from 8 stores at the end of 2001 to 40 stores at the end of 2002. The Retail segment's net sales grew from $19 million in
2001 to $283 million in 2002. While the Retail segment may have cannibalized some net sales from the Company's preexisting sales channels in the U.S., the Company believed that a substantial
portion of the Retail segment's net sales was incremental to the Company's total net sales. See additional comments below related to the Retail segment under the heading "Segment Operating
Performance." 




27
















 
 







Fourth,
the Company's average unit pricing increased 3% during 2002 as a result of various changes in overall unit mix offset by somewhat lower pricing
year-over-year on comparative Macintosh systems. Net sales per Macintosh unit sold during 2002 of $1,462 per unit reflected the shift in mix towards relatively higher-priced
portable Macintosh systems and reflected the impact on net sales of the relatively higher-priced new iMac design introduced during 2002. The impact of these changes in mix were offset by the decline
in unit sales of relatively higher-priced Power Macintosh systems and by lower pricing on comparative Macintosh systems during 2002 for most of the Company's Macintosh product lines in response to
industry pricing pressure.


Fifth,
any comparison of net sales in 2002 versus 2001 must consider the effect of unusually low net sales during the first quarter of 2001. This was attributable to several
factors at the beginning of 2001, including continued deterioration in worldwide demand for personal computers, rebate programs and price cuts instituted by the Company during that quarter that cost
the Company approximately $138 million, and a plan implemented by the Company during the first quarter of 2001 that reduced substantially the level of inventory in its distribution channels
that resulted in a decline in channel inventory of approximately 300,000 units during that quarter. 




Offsetting
the favorable factors discussed above, the Company's net sales in 2002 were negatively impacted by several notable factors. 







First,
unit sales of Power Macintosh systems fell 18% during 2002 as compared to 2001. This followed a 35% decline in Power Macintosh unit sales in 2001 from 2000. The
Company believed that weak economic conditions over the past several years had a pronounced negative impact on its professional and creative customers and that many of these customers continued to
delay upgrades of their Power Macintosh systems due to the Company's ongoing transition to Mac OS X, its new operating system, and in anticipation of certain software vendors transitioning their
Macintosh applications to run natively in Mac OS X. Further, the Company did not experience the anticipated increase in Power Macintosh sales that it expected following the introduction
of Adobe's PhotoShop 7 during 2002. Additionally, many professional users may have postponed upgrading their systems until after the introduction of Mac OS X Jaguar released in
the fourth quarter of 2002. Others may have delayed upgrading until after the availability of other professionally oriented software applications for Mac OS X such as QuarkXPress.


Second,
despite the overall increase in net sales during 2002 in the Americas, the Company continued to see weakness in its U.S. education channel. Total net sales in this
channel fell 15% in 2002 and 4% in 2001. These declines were consistent with industry data that showed the Company losing market share in the U.S. education market in each of the last two fiscal
years. The Company believed this weakness was caused by multiple factors, including increased price competition in this price sensitive market from the Company's competitors who sell Windows-based
personal computers. Additionally, some of the Company's education customers appeared to be delaying technology purchases due to concerns about the overall impact of the weaker economy on their
available funding.


Third,
the personal computer industry in general and the Company specifically experienced soft demand for its products due to adverse global economic conditions, political
uncertainties, and a lengthening of consumer, creative, and business personal computer upgrade cycles. 




Segment Operating Performance  


The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable operating segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The
Americas segment includes both North and South America, except for the activities of the Company's Retail segment. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa.
The Japan segment includes only Japan, except for the activities of the Company's Retail segment. The Retail segment currently operates 


28






 


Apple-owned
retail stores in the United States and opened its first international store in Tokyo, Japan in the first quarter of 2004. Each reportable operating segment provides similar hardware and
software products and similar services. Further information regarding the Company's operating segments may be found in Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements at Note 11, "Segment Information and Geographic Data." 


Americas  


Net sales in the Americas segment during 2003 increased $50 million or 2% compared to 2002. During 2003 and 2002, the Americas segment represented approximately 51% and
55%, respectively, of the Company's total net sales and represented approximately 54% and 56%, respectively, of total Macintosh unit sales. The results of the Americas segment are similar to the
overall results of the Company as they reflect substantially lower unit sales and net sales of Power Macintosh systems and iMac systems, partially offset by increases in unit sales and net sales of
PowerBooks. The net sales of the Americas segment, and the Company in total, also reflect substantially higher sales of peripherals, software, and services during 2003 compared to 2002 due primarily
to higher sales of iPods and
Internet services. The Americas segment has been negatively affected by weakness in its U.S. education channel. As noted above, total net sales and unit sales in the U.S. education channel during 2003
were down 4% and 6%, respectively, compared to the same period in 2002. The Company believes this decline is caused by increased competition in the education market and by a reduction in spending by
U.S. educational institutions due to federal and state funding concerns and tax revenue shortfalls resulting from the weak economy. Additionally, some of the decline during 2003 in net sales and unit
sales of Macintosh systems in the Americas segment may be the result of the operation of the Company's Retail segment whose net sales, all of which occurred within the U.S., increased significantly
during 2003. 


Net
sales for the Americas segment increased 3% or $94 million in 2002 compared to 2001. The Americas segment was negatively affected by a decline in U.S. education sales in 2002 of
$215 million. The Americas segment also experienced a 17% decline in Power Macintosh unit sales. However, outside of the U.S. education channel, unit sales of consumer desktop and portable
systems rebounded from the substantial declines experienced in 2001, rising a combined 31% in 2002. Sales of software, peripherals, and accessories were also up in the Americas during 2002. Growth in
unit sales of consumer oriented systems during 2002 in the Americas is somewhat attributable to the significantly depressed level of net sales experienced in the first quarter of 2001 as discussed
above. However, growth in the Americas was somewhat negatively affected, particularly with respect to consumer-oriented systems, by the significant growth of the Company's Retail segment in the U.S.
More than 70% of the Retail segment's Macintosh unit sales during 2002 were for iMacs and iBooks. 


Europe  


Net sales in Europe increased $58 million or 5% during 2003 as compared to 2002 while Macintosh unit sales declined by 5% during the same period. Europe's operating
results were consistent with the trend experienced in the Americas and by the Company as a whole. Europe experienced weakened demand for Power Macintosh, iMac and iBook systems in 2003, partially
offset by strong demand for PowerBooks whose net sales increased by 48% or $100 million from 2002. Europe also realized increased sales of peripherals, software, and service, primarily
attributable to higher sales of iPods, accessories and APP. 


Economic
conditions in Europe remained weak throughout 2002, and the overall demand for the Company's products in that region remained flat during 2002 versus 2001. Unit sales in Europe for 2002
reflect relatively stronger demand for consumer-oriented products, particularly iBook whose unit sales increased 27% in 2002, offset by declines in Power Macintosh unit sales. 


Japan  


Net sales in Japan decreased $12 million or 2% during 2003 as compared to the same period in 2002, the weakest year-to-date performance of any of
the Company's operating segments. Japan's Macintosh unit 


29






 


sales
were particularly weak in 2003, declining 12%, and were primarily attributable to lower sales of iMac and iBook systems, partially offset by an increase in PowerBook sales as well as higher
sales of peripherals and other hardware. Japan's Macintosh unit sales remain significantly below the segment's historic levels due to current economic conditions that remain particularly negative in
Japan. 


Net
sales in Japan remained flat during 2002 versus 2001, with a slight decline in unit sales of 2%. Consistent with the Company's other geographic operating segments, during 2002 Japan showed growth
in unit sales of consumer systems and a decline in unit sales of Power Macintosh systems. Japan's iMac unit sales increased 85% in 2002. However, in the case of Japan the increase in iMac unit
shipments in 2002 versus 2001 was primarily the result of the unusually depressed level of net sales experienced by the Company in the first quarter of 2001 as discussed above. Additionally, net sales
in Japan on a sequential and year-over-year comparative basis generally worsened as 2002 progressed reflecting particularly poor economic conditions in Japan. 


Retail  


The Company opened 25 new retail stores during 2003, bringing the total number of open stores to 65 as of September 27, 2003, which compares to 40 open stores as of
September 28, 2002 and 8 open stores as of September 29, 2001. During the first quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company opened 9 additional stores including its first international store in
the Ginza in Tokyo, Japan. The Retail segment's net sales grew to $621 million during 2003 from $283 million in 2002 and from $19 million in 2001. The $338 million or 119%
increase in net sales during 2003 reflects the impact from opening 25 new stores in 2003, the full year impact of 2002 store openings, as well as an increase in average revenue per store. Total
Macintosh sales increased by approximately $170 million of which $108 million related to year-over-year increases in PowerBook sales. The Retail segment has also
contributed strongly to the increases in net sales of peripherals, software and services experienced by the Company during 2003. During 2003, approximately 45% of the Retail segment's net sales came
from the sale of Apple-branded and third-party peripherals, software and services as compared to 28% for the Company as a whole. With an average of 54 stores open during 2003, the Retail segment
achieved annualized revenue per store of approximately $11.5 million, as compared to approximately $10.2 million based on an average of 28 stores open in 2002. 


As
measured by the Company's operating segment reporting, the Retail segment improved from a loss of $22 million during 2002 to a loss of $5 million during 2003. This improvement is
primarily attributable to the segment's year-over-year increase in net sales, which resulted in higher leverage on occupancy, depreciation and other fixed costs. 


Expansion
of the Retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure, operating lease commitments, personnel, and other
operating expenses. Capital expenditures associated with the Retail segment since its inception totaled approximately $290 million through the end of fiscal 2003, $92 million of which
was incurred during 2003. As of September 27, 2003, the Retail segment had approximately 1,300 employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with retail store space and
related facilities of $354 million. The Company would incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate its Retail segment or close individual stores. Such costs could adversely affect the
Company's results of operations and financial condition. Investment in a new business model such as the Retail segment is inherently risky, particularly in light of the significant investment
involved, the current economic climate, and the fixed nature of a substantial portion of the Retail segment's operating expenses.

Gross
margin decreased to 27.5% of net sales in 2003 from 27.9% of net sales in 2002. This decline in gross margin reflects relatively aggressive pricing actions on several Macintosh models instituted
by the Company beginning in late fiscal 2002 as a result of continued pricing pressure throughout the personal computer industry, lower sales of relatively higher margin Power Macintosh systems during
the first three fiscal quarters of 2003, and increased air freight and manufacturing costs associated with the production ramp-up of the new Power Mac G5 and 15-inch
PowerBook, both of which began shipping in volume during September 2003. This decline is also attributable to a rise in certain component costs as the year progressed. The aforementioned
negative factors affecting gross margins during 2003 were partially offset by the increase in higher margin software and direct sales. 


The
Company anticipates that its gross margin and the gross margin of the overall personal computer industry will remain under pressure throughout fiscal 2004 in light of weak economic conditions,
price competition in the personal computer industry, and potential increases in component pricing. The Company also expects to continue to incur air freight charges on the Power Mac G5 and
other products during 2004. 


The
foregoing statements regarding the Company's expected gross margin during 2004, general demand for personal computers, anticipated industry component pricing, anticipated air freight charges, and
future economic conditions are forward-looking. There can be no assurance that current gross margins will be maintained, targeted gross margin levels will be achieved, or current margins on existing
individual products will be maintained. In general, gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued
industry wide global pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, potential increases in the cost and availability of raw material and outside manufacturing services, and
potential changes to the Company's product mix, including higher unit sales of consumer products with lower average selling prices and lower gross margins. In response to these downward pressures, the
Company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its products. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company's ability to effectively manage product quality and warranty
costs and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. The Company's operating strategy and pricing take into account anticipated changes in foreign currency exchange rates over time; however, the
Company's results of operations can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates. 


The
Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product shipments. Because the Company's markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there
is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third-parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products or components. The Company's operating results and
financial condition in the past have been and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the Company's ability to manage its inventory levels and outstanding purchase commitments and to
respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns. 


Gross
margin increased to 27.9% of net sales in 2002 from 23.0% in 2001. Gross margin in 2001 was unusually low resulting from negative gross margin of 2% experienced in the first quarter of 2001. As
a 


31






 




percentage
of net sales, the Company's quarterly gross margins declined during fiscal 2002 from 31% in the first quarter down to 26% in the fourth quarter. This decline resulted from several factors
including a rise in component costs as the year progressed and aggressive pricing by the Company across its products lines instituted as a result of continued pricing pressures in the personal
computer industry.

Research and Development (R&D)  


The Company recognizes that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely
development of new and enhanced products that are central to the Company's core business strategy. The Company has historically relied upon innovation to remain competitive. R&D expense amounted to
approximately 8% of total net sales during 2003, 2002 and 2001, up substantially from approximately 5% of total net sales in fiscal year 2000 and recent earlier periods. The Company's management
believes that maintaining or increasing the pace of innovation and product development is the best way to respond to current economic and market conditions and will continue to position the Company
for future growth as conditions improve. R&D expense increased 6% or $25 million to $471 million in 2003 as compared to 2002, which follows a $16 million increase in 2002 as
compared to 2001. The overall increase in R&D expense relates primarily to increased headcount and support for new product development activities. R&D spending also included capitalized software
development costs of approximately $14.7 million related to the development of Mac OS X Panther in 2003; approximately $13.3 million associated with the development of
Mac OS X Jaguar and approximately $6 million associated with the PowerSchool enterprise student information system in 2002; and approximately $5.4 million associated with
the development of the original version of Mac OS X in 2001. Further information related to the Company's capitalization of software development costs may be found in Part II,
Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 


Selling, General, and Administrative Expense (SG&A)  


SG&A increased $103 million or 9% during 2003 as compared to 2002 due primarily to the Company's continued expansion of the Retail segment and increases in headcount.
The overall increase was partially offset by a decrease in current year discretionary spending on marketing and advertising and by savings resulting from the 2003 and 2002 restructuring activities
described below. 


SG&A
decreased $29 million or 3% during 2002 as compared to 2001. The decrease in SG&A in 2002 was primarily the result of lower discretionary spending on marketing and advertising expenses,
decreased spending related to information systems, and benefits directly related to the Company's restructuring actions in 2002 and 2001. The decreases were partially offset by higher sales expense in
2002 resulting from increased operating expenses associated with expansion of the Company's Retail segment.

Restructuring Actions  


During the second quarter of 2003, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions that resulted in recognition of a total restructuring charge of
$2.8 million. The primary focus of actions taken in the second quarter were for the most part supplemental to actions initiated in the prior two quarters and focused on further headcount
reductions in various sales and marketing functions in the Company's Americas and Europe operating segments and further reductions associated with PowerSchool related activities in the Americas
operating segment. The second quarter actions resulted in recognition of severance costs of $2.4 million for termination of 93 employees, 92 of whom were terminated prior to the end of 2003 at
a cost of $2.2 million. During the second quarter of 2003, an additional $400,000 was accrued for asset write-offs and lease payments on an abandoned facility in the Americas
operating segment. The Company estimates these restructuring actions will reduce quarterly operating expenses by $1.5 million. 


During
the first quarter of 2003, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of $24 million that resulted in the termination of manufacturing
operations at the Company-owned facility in Singapore, further reductions in headcount resulting from the shift in PowerSchool product strategy that took place at the end of fiscal 2002, and
termination of various sales and marketing activities in the United States and Europe. These restructuring actions will ultimately result in the elimination of 260 positions worldwide, all but one was
eliminated by the end of 2003. The Company estimates these restructuring actions will reduce quarterly operating expenses by $6 million. 


During
fiscal 2002, the Company recorded total restructuring charges of $30 million related to actions intended to eliminate certain activities and better align the Company's operating expenses
with existing general economic conditions and to partially offset the cost of continuing investments in new product development and investments in the Company's Retail operating segment. The Company
estimates these restructuring actions will result in reduced quarterly operating expenses of approximately $10 million. 


Of
the $30 million restructuring charge for fiscal 2002, $6 million was incurred in the fourth quarter of 2002 related to actions designed to reduce headcount costs in corporate
operations and sales and to adjust its PowerSchool product strategy. Headcount actions, primarily in corporate operations, sales, and PowerSchool related research and development, resulted in the
elimination of approximately 180 positions worldwide at a cost of $1.8 million. The shift in product strategy at PowerSchool included discontinuing development and marketing of a PowerSchool
product that resulted in the impairment of previously capitalized development costs associated with the product in the amount of $4.5 million. The remaining charge in 2002 of $24 million
was incurred in the first quarter of 2002 and resulted in the elimination of approximately 425 positions worldwide, at a cost of $8 million. Positions were eliminated primarily in the Company's
operations, information systems, and administrative functions. In addition, these restructuring actions also included significant changes in the Company's information systems strategy resulting in
termination of equipment leases and cancellation of existing projects and activities. Related lease and contract cancellation charges totaled $12 million, and charges for asset impairments
totaled $4 million. During the first quarter of 2003, the Company reversed the remaining unused accrual of $600,000. 


Purchased In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D)  


During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company acquired Emagic GmbH, a provider of professional software solutions for computer based music production, for approximately
$30 million in cash; $551,000 of which was allocated to IPR&D. The amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition, because the technological feasibility of
products under development had not been established and no alternative future uses existed. The IPR&D relates primarily to Emagic's Logic series technology and extensions. At the date of the
acquisition, the products under development were between 43%-83% complete, and it was expected that the remaining work would be completed during the Company's fiscal 2003 at a cost of
approximately $415,000. The remaining efforts, which were completed in 2003, included finalizing user interface design and development, and testing. The fair value of the IPR&D was determined 


33






 


using
the income approach, which reflects the projected free cash flows that will be generated by the IPR&D projects and that are attributable to the acquired technology, and discounting the projected
net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 25%. 


In
May 2001, the Company acquired PowerSchool, Inc., a provider of web-based student information systems for K-12 schools and districts that enables schools to
record, access, report, and manage their student data and performance in real-time, and gives parents real-time web access to track their children's progress. Of total purchase
consideration of $66.1 million, $10.8 million was allocated to IPR&D and was expensed upon acquisition because the technological feasibility of products under development had not been
established and no alternative future uses existed. The IPR&D relates to technologies representing processes and expertise employed to design, develop, and deploy a functioning, scalable
web-based student information system for use by K-12 schools. At the date of the acquisition, the PowerSchool product under development was approximately 50% complete, and it
was expected that the remaining 50% would be completed during the Company's fiscal 2002 at a cost of approximately $9.25 million. The remaining efforts, which were completed during 2002,
included completion of coding, finalizing user interface design and development, and testing. The fair value of the IPR&D was determined using the income approach, which reflects the projected free
cash flows that will be generated by the IPR&D projects and that are attributable to the acquired technology, and discounting the projected net cash flows back to their present value using a discount
rate of 25%.

Gains and Losses on Non-current Investments  


The Company has held investments in EarthLink Inc. (EarthLink), Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai), ARM Holdings plc (ARM) and certain investments in private
companies. These investments have been reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as long term assets within other assets and have been categorized as available-for-sale
requiring that they be carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company recognizes an
impairment charge to earnings in the event a decline in fair value below the cost basis of one of these investments is determined to be other-than-temporary. The Company
includes recognized gains and losses resulting from the sale or from other-than-temporary declines in fair value associated with these investments in other income and expense.
Further information related to the Company's non-current debt and equity investments may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Note 2 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 


During
2003, the Company sold 1,875,000 shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of approximately $9 million, and a gain before taxes of approximately $8 million. Additionally, the
Company sold its remaining investment in ARM stock, 278,000 shares, for net proceeds of approximately $295,000, and a 


34






 




gain
before taxes of $270,000, and sold its remaining investment in EarthLink stock, 6,540,000 shares, for net proceeds of approximately $37 million, and a gain before taxes of
$2 million. The fair value of the Company's remaining investment in Akamai as of September 27, 2003, was approximately $5 million. 


During
2002, the Company determined that declines in the fair value of certain of these investments were other-than-temporary. As a result, the Company recognized a
$44 million charge to earnings to writedown the basis of its investment in EarthLink, a $6 million charge to earnings to writedown the basis of its investment in Akamai, and a
$15 million charge to earnings to writedown the basis of its investment in a private company investment. These losses in 2002 were partially offset by the sale of 117,000 shares of EarthLink
stock for net proceeds of $2 million and a gain before taxes of $223,000, the sale of 250,000 shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of $2 million and a gain before taxes of $710,000,
and the sale of approximately 4.7 million shares of ARM stock for both net proceeds and a gain before taxes of $21 million. 


During
2001, the Company sold a total of approximately 1 million shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of $39 million and recorded a gain before taxes of $36 million, and sold a
total of approximately 29.8 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of $176 million and recorded a gain before taxes of $174 million. These gains during 2001 were partially
offset by a $114 million charge to earnings that reflected an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of the Company's investment in EarthLink and an
$8 million charge that reflected an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of certain private company investments. 


Unrealized Loss on Convertible Securities  


On October 1, 2000, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 133, 
Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities
. SFAS No. 133 established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, hedging activities, and exposure definition. SFAS
No. 133 required the Company to adjust the carrying value of the derivative component of its investment in Samsung to earnings during the first quarter of 2001, the before tax effect of which
was an unrealized loss of approximately $13 million. 


Interest and Other Income, Net  


Net interest and other income decreased $29 million or 26% to $83 million during 2003. The decrease is primarily the result of declining investment yields on the
Company's cash and short-term investments resulting from substantially lower market interest rates. The weighted average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents
and short-term investments fell to 1.89% in 2003 compared to 2.85% in 2002. The decrease is offset by the increase of $14 million from the gain on the sales of short term
investments from the Company's fixed income portfolio, and the increase of $6 million from the gain on the forward purchase agreement during the fourth quarter of 2003. 


Net
interest and other income was $112 million in fiscal 2002, compared to $217 million in fiscal 2001. This $105 million or 48% decrease was primarily the result of declining
investment yields on the Company's cash and short-term investments resulting from substantially lower market interest rates. The weighted average interest rate earned by the Company on its
cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments fell to 2.85% in 2002 compared to 5.38% in 2001. 


Provision for Income Taxes  


The Company's effective tax rate for 2003 was 26% compared to the higher statutory rate due primarily to research and development credits, a non-taxable gain on
stock repurchase and certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes were provided. As of September 27, 2003, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible
temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $452 million before being offset against certain deferred tax liabilities and a valuation allowance for presentation on the Company's
consolidated balance sheet. As of September 27, 2003, a valuation allowance of $30 million was 


35






 


recorded
against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax losses that may not be realized. The valuation allowance relates principally to the operating loss carryforwards acquired from NeXT and
other acquisitions, the utilization of which is subject to certain limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including
income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining net deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to evaluate the
realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance. 


On
April 10, 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) proposed adjustments to the Company's federal income tax returns for the years 1998 through 2000, and the Company has made certain
prepayments thereon. Certain of these adjustments are being contested through the IRS Appeals Office. Substantially all IRS audit issues for years prior to 1998 have been resolved. Management believes
that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. Should any issues addressed in
the Company's tax audits be resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution
occurs. 


Cumulative Effects of Accounting Changes  


Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity  


On May 15, 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 150, 
Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity
. SFAS No. 150 requires issuers to classify as liabilities certain freestanding financial instruments that embody
obligations for the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 150 on June 29, 2003, which resulted in a favorable
cumulative effect type adjustment of approximately $3 million. This adjustment represented the mark-to-market adjustment to fair value for a forward purchase agreement
that allowed the Company to acquire 1.5 million shares of its common stock at a price of
$16.64 per share. The Company settled this forward purchase agreement in August 2003. The settlement resulted in an additional gain of approximately $6 million, which is included in
interest and other income, net. 


Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations  


On September 29, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 143, 
Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations
, which
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. Net of the related
income tax effect of approximately $1 million, adoption of SFAS No. 143 resulted in an unfavorable cumulative-effect type adjustment to net income during 2003 of approximately
$2 million. This adjustment represents cumulative depreciation and accretion that would have been recognized through the date of adoption of SFAS No. 143 had the statement been applied
to the Company's existing asset retirement obligations at the time they were initially incurred. 


Accounting for Derivatives  


The adoption of SFAS 133 during 2001 resulted in a favorable cumulative-effect type adjustment of approximately $12 million, net of a related income tax effect of
approximately $5 million. 


Further
information related to the adoption of SFAS Nos. 133, 143 and 150 and the resulting cumulative accounting effects may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this
Form 10-K at Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 


Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  


The Company currently measures compensation expense for its employee stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board
(APB) Opinion No. 25, 


36






 


 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
 and provides pro forma disclosures of the effect on net income and earnings per share as if the fair value-based method had been
applied in measuring compensation expense. The Company has elected to follow APB Opinion No. 25 because, as further discussed in Part II, Item 8 of this
Form 10-K at Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the alternative fair value accounting provided for under SFAS No. 123, 
 
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
,
requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options and
employee stock purchase plan shares. Under APB Opinion No. 25, when the exercise price of the Company's employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the
grant, no compensation expense is recognized. 


The
FASB decided on April 22, 2003 to require all companies to expense the value of employee stock options. Companies will be required to measure the cost of employee stock options according to
their fair value. The FASB has indicated that it plans to issue in the first quarter of calendar year 2004 an exposure draft of a new accounting standard addressing this matter. Prior to issuance of
this exposure draft, the FASB has indicated it will be addressing several significant technical issues. Among other things, the FASB must determine the extent to which the new accounting standard will
permit adjustments to recognized expense for actual option forfeitures and actual performance outcomes. This determination will affect the timing and amount of compensation expense recognized. Also, a
method to determine the fair value of employee stock options must be established. Current accounting standards require use of an option-pricing model, such as the Black-Scholes formula, to determine
fair value and provide guidance on adjusting some of the input factors used in the model. This valuation approach has received significant criticism and may be subject to changes that could have a
significant impact on the calculated fair value of employee stock options under the new standard. 


At
the Company's annual shareholder's meeting on April 24, 2003, shareholders approved a proposal requesting that the Company's Board of Directors (the Board) establish a policy of expensing
the value of all future employee stock options issued by the Company. The Board and management appreciate and take seriously the views expressed by the Company's shareholders. As discussed in the
Company's Form 10-Q for the period ended March 29, 2003, the Company had decided not to expense the value of employee stock options until the FASB finalizes its new
accounting standard on the matter. The Company based this decision on the FASB's announced intention to soon require all companies to expense the value of employee stock options and the FASB's
near-term review of technical issues that will play a significant role in determining the fair value of and accounting for employee stock options. The Company monitors progress at the FASB
and other developments with respect to the general issue of employee stock compensation. In the future, should the Company expense the value of employee stock options, either out of choice or due to
new requirements issued by the FASB, the Company may have to recognize substantially more compensation expense in future periods that could have a material adverse impact on the Company's future
results of operations. 


Recent Accounting Pronouncements  


In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), 
Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities
. FIN 46 clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 and applied immediately to any variable interest entities created after
January 31, 2003 and to variable interest entities in which an interest is obtained after that date. For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the
provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after December 15, 2003. The adoption of the provision of FIN 46 related to variable
interests created after January 31, 2003 did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial position. The Company continues to evaluate the provisions of
FIN 46, and does not believe that the adoption of the remaining provisions will have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position. 


37








 
 





In May 2003, the FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached consensus on EITF Issue No. 00-21, 
Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables
. EITF Issue No. 00-21 provides guidance on how to account for certain arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple
products, services, and/or rights to use assets. The provisions of EITF Issue No. 00-21 apply to revenue transactions entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15,
2003. Additionally, in August 2003, the EITF reached consensus on EITF Issue No. 03-5, 
Applicability of AICPA Statement of
Position 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition," to Non-Software Deliverables in an Arrangement Containing More-than-Incidental
Software.
 EITF Issue No. 03-5 provides guidance on determining whether non-software deliverables are included within the scope of
SOP 97-2, and accordingly, whether multiple element arrangements are to be accounted for in accordance with EITF Issue No. 00-21 or SOP 97-2.
The Company currently applies the requirements of SOP No. 97-2 when accounting for all multiple element transactions. The Company does not anticipate the application of either EITF
Issue Nos. 00-21 or 03-5 will have a significant impact on its results of operations or financial position.

As
of September 27, 2003, the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments portfolio totaled $4.566 billion, an increase of $229 million from the end
of fiscal 2002. The Company's short-term investment portfolio consists primarily of investments in U.S. Treasury and Agency securities, U.S. corporate securities, and foreign securities.
Foreign securities consist primarily of foreign commercial paper, certificates of deposit and time deposits with foreign
institutions, most of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company's investments are generally liquid and investment grade. 


As
a result of declining investment yields on the Company's cash equivalents and short-term investments resulting from substantially lower market interest rates during 2003, the Company
has elected to reduce the average maturity of its portfolio to maintain liquidity for future investment opportunities when market interest rates increase. Accordingly, during 2003 the Company
increased its holdings in short-term investment grade instruments, both in U.S. corporate and foreign securities, that are classified as cash equivalents and has reduced its holdings in
longer-term U.S. corporate securities classified as short-term investments. 


Although
the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments increased in 2003, the Company's working capital at September 27, 2003 decreased by $200 million as
compared to the end of 


38






 




fiscal
2002 due primarily to the current year reclassification of the Company's long-term debt as a current obligation resulting from its scheduled maturity in February 2004. 


The
primary sources of total cash and cash equivalents in fiscal 2003 were $289 million in cash generated by operating activities and $53 million in proceeds from the issuance of common
stock, partially offset by $164 million utilized for capital expenditures and $26 million for the repurchase of common stock. 


The
Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital expenditures, debt
obligations, stock repurchase activity, outstanding commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. 


Debt  


The Company currently has debt outstanding in the form of $300 million of aggregate principal amount 6.5% unsecured notes that were originally issued in 1994. The notes,
which pay interest semiannually, were sold at 99.925% of par, for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. The notes, along with approximately $4 million of unamortized deferred gains on closed
interest rate swaps, are due in February 2004 and therefore have been classified as current debt as of September 27, 2003. The Company currently anticipates utilizing its existing cash
balances to settle these notes when due. 


Capital Expenditures  


The Company's total capital expenditures were $164 million during fiscal 2003, $92 million of which were for retail store facilities and equipment related to the
Company's Retail segment and $72 million of which were primarily for corporate infrastructure, including information systems enhancements and operating facilities enhancements and expansions.
The Company currently anticipates it will utilize approximately $160 million for capital expenditures during 2004, approximately $85 million of which is expected to be utilized for
further expansion of the Company's Retail segment and the remainder utilized to support normal replacement of existing capital assets and enhancements to general information technology infrastructure. 


Stock Repurchase Plan  


In July 1999, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does
not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time. 


During
the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company entered into a forward purchase agreement to acquire 1.5 million shares of its common stock in September of 2003 at an average price of $16.64 per
share for a total cost of $25.5 million. In August 2003, the Company settled this agreement prior to its maturity, at which time the Company's common stock had a fair value of $22.81.
Other than this forward purchase transaction, the Company has not engaged in any transactions to repurchase its common stock since fiscal 2000. Since inception of the stock repurchase plan, the
Company had repurchased a total of 6.55 million shares at a cost of $217 million. The Company was still authorized to repurchase up to an additional $283 million of its common
stock as of September 27, 2003. 


Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  


The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the Company has financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative
instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity
that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company. 


39






 


Lease Commitments  


As of September 27, 2003, the Company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases of approximately $600 million, $354 million of
which related to the lease of retail space and related facilities. Remaining terms on the Company's existing operating leases range from 1 to 12 years. Subsequent to September 27, 2003,
the Company entered into additional operating lease commitments for retail space with future lease commitments totaling $64 million for periods ranging from 10 to 12 years. 


Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Component Suppliers  


The Company utilizes several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company's products and to perform final assembly and test of finished
products. These contract manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods ranging from 1 to 3 months. The
Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of
purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments typically cover the Company's forecasted component and manufacturing requirements
for periods ranging from 30 to 130 days. As of September 27, 2003, the Company had outstanding third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of approximately
$848 million. 


Indemnifications  


The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party
intellectual property rights. Other licensing agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in
the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement
claim asserted against itself or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims that would have a material
adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. 


Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition  


Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company's operating results and financial condition, past financial performance should not be
considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. 


General economic conditions and current economic and political uncertainty could adversely affect the demand for the Company's products and the financial health of its
suppliers, distributors, and resellers.  


The Company's operating performance depends significantly on general economic conditions. For much of the past several years, demand for the Company's products has been
negatively impacted by difficult global economic conditions. Additionally, some of the Company's education customers appear to be delaying technology purchases due to concerns about the overall impact
of the weaker economy on their available funding. Continued uncertainty about future economic conditions continues to make it difficult to forecast future operating results. Should global and regional
economic conditions fail to improve or continue to deteriorate, demand for the Company's products could continue to be adversely affected, as could the financial health of its suppliers, distributors,
and resellers. 


War, terrorism or public health issues could disrupt supply, delivery or demand of products which could negatively affect the Company's operations and performance.  


War, terrorism or public health issues, whether in the U.S. or abroad, have caused and could continue to cause damage or disruption to international commerce by creating
economic and political uncertainties 


40






 


that
may have a strong negative impact on the global economy, the Company, and the Company's suppliers or customers. Although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such
events, such events could result in a decrease in demand for the Company's products, make it difficult or impossible to deliver products to its customers, or to receive components from its suppliers,
and could create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply chain. The Company's operating results and financial condition have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by
these events. 


The
Company and some of its manufacturing vendors and component suppliers have significant operations in various locations throughout Asia, including locations in mainland China, the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, and Singapore, all of which were subject to the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) travel
advisories at times during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2003. Similar travel advisories were issued for Taiwan, where a significant amount of the Company's portable Macintosh systems and
the iPod are assembled. Should the severity of the SARs threat increase or other public health issues arise, the Company could be negatively impacted by the need for more stringent employee travel
restrictions, additional limitations in the availability of freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between various regions, delays in production ramps of new
products, and disruptions in the operations of the Company's manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. 


The market for personal computers and related peripherals and services is highly competitive. If the Company is unable to effectively compete in these markets, its results of
operations could be adversely affected.  


The personal computer industry is highly competitive and is characterized by aggressive pricing practices, downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new
products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by
competitors, price sensitivity on the part of consumers, and a large number of competitors. Over the past several years, price competition in the market for personal computers and related peripherals
has been particularly intense. The Company's competitors who sell Windows-based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins in order to gain or maintain market
share in response to the weakness in demand that began in the second half of calendar 2000 for personal computing products. The Company's results of operations and financial condition have been, and
in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing pressures and downward pressures on gross margins. 


The
personal computer industry has also been characterized by rapid technological advances in software functionality, hardware performance, and features based on existing or emerging industry
standards. Further, as the personal computer industry and its customers place more reliance on the Internet, an increasing number of Internet devices that are smaller and simpler than traditional
personal computers may compete for market share with the Company's existing products. Several competitors of the Company have either targeted or announced their intention to target certain of the
Company's key market segments, including consumer, education, professional and consumer digital video editing, and design and publishing. Several of the Company's competitors have introduced or
announced plans to introduce digital music products that mimic many of the unique design, technical features, and solutions of the Company's products. The Company has a significant number of
competitors, many of whom have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, and technological resources, as well as broader product lines and larger installed customer bases than those of the Company.
Additionally, there has been a trend towards consolidation in the personal computer industry that has resulted in larger and potentially stronger competitors in the Company's markets. 


The
Company is currently the only maker of hardware using the Mac OS. The Mac OS has a minority market share in the personal computer market, which is dominated by makers of computers utilizing
Microsoft's Windows operating systems. The Company's future operating results and financial condition 


41






 




are
substantially dependent on its ability to continue to develop improvements to the Macintosh platform in order to maintain perceived design and functional advantages over competing platforms,
including Windows. 


The
Company is currently focused on market opportunities related to digital music distribution and related consumer electronic devices including iPods. The Company faces increasing competition from
other companies promoting their own digital music distribution services, free peer-to-peer music services, emerging companies, and larger companies that may have greater
resources, including technical and marketing resources, and supplier relationships. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to provide products and services that effectively compete in
these markets. Failure to effectively compete could negatively affect the Company's operating results and financial position. 


The Company has higher research and development and selling, general and administrative costs, as a percentage of revenue, than many of its competitors.  


The Company's ability to compete successfully and maintain attractive gross margins is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow of innovative
and competitive products and technologies to the marketplace. As a result, the Company incurs higher research and development costs as a percentage of revenue than its competitors who sell personal
computers based on other operating systems. Many of these competitors seek to compete aggressively on price and maintain very low cost structures. Further, as a result of the expansion of the
Company's Retail segment and costs associated with marketing the Company's brand including its unique operating system, the Company incurs higher selling costs as a percentage of revenue than many of
its competitors. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive gross margins, its results of operations may be materially adversely affected by its
operating cost structure. 


The Company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions in order to remain competitive and effectively stimulate customer demand.  


Due to the highly volatile nature of the personal computer industry, which is characterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid technological advances, the Company
must continually introduce new products and technologies, enhance existing products in order to remain competitive, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new products and upgraded versions of
the Company's existing products. The success of new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors, including market acceptance; the Company's ability to manage the risks associated with
product transitions, including production ramp issues; the availability of application software for new products; the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand;
the availability of products in appropriate quantities to meet anticipated demand; and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly,
the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect that new products will have on its sales or results of operations. 


During
2001, the Company introduced a new client operating system, Mac OS X, and delivered its first major upgrade, Mac OS X version 10.1. Other major upgrades include Mac OS X Jaguar in 2002 and most
recently Mac OS X Panther in October 2003. Inability of the Company to provide additional improvements in the performance and functionality of Mac OS X, advance customer acceptance of the new
operating system and its upgrades, obtain the continued commitment of software developers to transition existing applications to run on Mac OS X, or create new applications to run on Mac OS X, may
have an adverse impact on the Company's operating results and financial condition. 


Because orders for components, and in some cases commitments to purchase components, must be placed in advance of customer orders, the Company faces substantial inventory risk.  


The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and products that have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value
and accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees of orders for inventories that have been cancelled. Although the Company believes its 


42






 


inventory
and related provisions are adequate, given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the computer industry, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur
additional inventory and related charges. In addition, such charges have had, and may have, a material effect on the Company's financial position and results of operations. 


The
Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. Because the Company's markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes,
there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products. Consistent with industry practice, components
are normally acquired through a combination of formal purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments typically cover the
Company's forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 130 days. The Company's operating results and financial condition have been in the past and may in
the future be materially adversely affected by the Company's ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns. 


Future operating results are dependent upon the Company's ability to obtain a sufficient supply of components, some of which are in short supply or available only from limited
sources.  


Although most components essential to the Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components including microprocessors and ASICs are
currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some key components (including without limitation DRAM, TFT-LCD flat-panel displays, and optical and magnetic
disk drives), while currently available to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide availability and pricing pressures. In addition, new products introduced
by the Company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. In
situations where a component or product utilizes new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until such time as the suppliers' yields have matured. The Company and other producers in the
personal computer industry also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. The Company uses some components that are not common to
the rest of the personal computer industry including certain microprocessors and ASICs. Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the
production of components other than those customized to meet the Company's requirements. If
the supply of a key component were to be delayed or constrained on a new or existing product, the Company's results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 


The
Company's ability to produce and market competitive products is also dependent on the ability and desire of IBM and Motorola, the sole suppliers of the PowerPC RISC-based
microprocessor for the Company's Macintosh computers, to provide the Company with a sufficient supply of microprocessors with price/performance features that compare favorably to those supplied to the
Company's competitors by Intel Corporation and other developers and producers of microprocessors used by personal computers using other operating systems. Further, despite its efforts to educate the
marketplace to the contrary, the Company believes that many of its current and potential customers believe that the relatively slower MHz rating or clock speed of the microprocessors it utilizes in
its Macintosh systems compares unfavorably to those utilized by other operating systems and translates to slower overall system performance. There have been instances in recent years where the
inability of the Company's suppliers to provide advanced PowerPC G4 and G3 microprocessors with higher clock speeds in sufficient quantity has had significant adverse effects on the Company's results
of operations. In addition, currently IBM is the Company's sole supplier of the G5 processor used in current Power Macintosh products and Motorola is the sole supplier of the G4 processors. The
inability in the future of the Company to obtain microprocessors in sufficient quantities with competitive price/performance features could have an adverse impact on the Company's results of
operations and financial condition.

The Company relies on third-party music content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.  


The Company contracts with third parties to offer their music content to customers through the Company's iTunes Music Store. The Company pays substantial fees to obtain the
rights to offer to its customers this third-party music. Many of the Company's licensing arrangements with these third-party content providers are short-term in nature and do not guarantee
the future renewal of these arrangements at commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Certain parties in the music industry have announced their intent to consolidate their music distribution
operations, which could limit the availability and increase the fees required to offer music content to customers through the iTunes Music Store. If the Company is unable to continue to offer a wide
variety of music content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or expand its geographic reach outside the United States, then sales and gross margins of the Company's iTunes Music Store as
well as related hardware and peripherals, including iPods, may be adversely affected. 


Third-party
content providers and artists require that the Company provide certain digital rights management solutions and other security mechanisms. If the requirements from content providers or
artists change, then the Company may be required to further develop or license technology to address such new rights and requirements. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to develop or
license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner, if at all, which could have a materially adverse affect on the Company's operating results and financial position. 


The Company is dependent on manufacturing and logistics services provided by third parties, many of whom are located outside of the United States.  


Many of the Company's products are manufactured in whole or in part by third-party manufacturers. In addition, the Company has outsourced much of its transportation and
logistics management. While outsourcing arrangements may lower the fixed cost of operations, they also reduce the Company's direct control over production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect
such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of the products manufactured, or the flexibility of the Company to respond to changing market conditions. Moreover, although arrangements
with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain at least initially responsible to the ultimate consumer for warranty service in the event of
product defects. Any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise, could adversely affect the Company's future
operating results and financial condition. 


Final
assembly of products sold by the Company is conducted in the Company's manufacturing facilities in Sacramento, California, and Cork, Ireland, and by external vendors in Fremont, California,
Fullerton, California, Taiwan, Korea, the Netherlands, the People's Republic of China, and the Czech Republic. Currently, manufacture of many of the components used in the Company's products and final
assembly of substantially all of the Company's portable products including PowerBooks, iBooks, and the iPod is performed by third-party vendors in Japan, Taiwan and China. If for any reason
manufacturing or logistics in any of these locations is disrupted by regional economic, business, environmental, medical, political, or military conditions or events, the Company's results of
operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 


The Company's products, from time to time, experience quality problems that can result in decreased net sales and operating profits.  


The Company sells highly complex hardware and software products that can contain defects in design and manufacture. Sophisticated operating system software and applications,
such as those sold by the Company, often contain "bugs" that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software. Defects may also occur in components and products the Company purchases from
third-parties that may be beyond its control. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware and software it sells. Failure to do so could result
in lost revenue, loss of reputation, and significant expense to remedy.

The Company's retail initiative has required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and
uncertainties.  


Through November 2003, the Company has opened 74 retail stores including its first international store in Tokyo, Japan. The Company's retail initiative has required
substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory, and personnel. The Company has also entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail
space with lease terms ranging from 5 to 15 years. The Company could incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate this initiative or close individual stores. Such costs could adversely
affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a relatively high proportion of the Retail segment's costs are fixed because of depreciation on store construction
costs and lease expense. As a result, significant losses would result should the Retail segment experience a decline in sales for any reason. 


Certain
of the Company's stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues that function as vehicles for general corporate marketing, corporate events, and brand awareness. Because
of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment in equipment and leasehold improvements than the Company's more typical retail stores. The
Company has opened four such stores and has one under construction. Because of their location and size, these high profile stores also require the Company to enter into substantially larger operating
lease commitments compared to those required for its more typical stores. Current leases on such locations have terms ranging from 10 to 15 years with total commitments per location over the
lease terms ranging from $25 million to $50 million. Closure or poor performance of one of these high profile stores could have a particularly significant negative impact on the
Company's results of operations and financial condition. 


Many
of the general risks and uncertainties the Company faces could also have an adverse impact on its Retail segment. Also, many factors unique to retail operations present risks and uncertainties,
some of which are beyond the Company's control, that could adversely affect the Retail segment's future results, cause its actual results to differ from those currently expected, and/or have an
adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations. Potential risks and uncertainties unique to retail operations that could have an adverse impact on the Retail segment include, among
other things, macro-economic factors that have a negative impact on general retail activity; inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation; lack of consumer acceptance of
the Company's retail approach; failure to attract new users to the Macintosh platform; inability to sell third-party hardware and software products at adequate margins; failure to manage relationships
with existing retail channel partners; lack of experience in managing retail operations outside the United States; costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of Apple-branded and
third-party retail inventory; and inability to obtain quality retail locations at reasonable cost. 


Unit sales of the Company's professionally oriented desktop systems have declined sharply over the past several years negatively impacting net sales and gross margin.  


Unit sales of Power Macintosh systems fell 13% during 2003 as compared to 2002 and fell 18% in 2002 from 2001. Power Macintosh unit sales have fallen as a percentage of total
Macintosh unit sales from 30% in 2001 to 22% in 2003. The Company believes that weak economic conditions over the past several years are having a pronounced negative impact on its professional and
creative customers who are the primary users of such systems. Also, it is likely that many of the Company's current and potential customers, particularly professional and creative customers who are
most likely to utilize the Company's Power Macintosh systems, believe that the relatively slower MHz rating or clock speed of the microprocessors it utilizes in its Macintosh systems compares
unfavorably to those utilized by other operating systems and translates to slower overall system performance. In addition to the negative impact on net sales, declining sales of Power Macintosh
systems also have a negative effect on the Company's overall gross margin because Power Macintosh systems generally have higher individual gross margins than the Company's other Macintosh systems.
Continued deterioration in Power Macintosh unit sales could adversely affect the Company's future net sales and gross margin. If future unit sales of Power Macintosh systems fail to 


45






 


partially
or fully recover, it will be difficult for the Company to improve its overall profitability. While the Company has introduced faster Power Macintosh systems utilizing 64-bit
PowerPC G5 processors during 2003, there can be no assurance that introduction of such systems will favorably impact net sales either in the short or long term. 


The Company faces increasing competition in the U.S. education market.  


Sales in the United States to both elementary and secondary schools, as well as for college and university customers, remain a core market for Apple. Net sales in these markets
fell to 18% of the Company's total net sales in 2003 from 21% and 26% in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The drop in 2003 reflects declines in both net sales and Macintosh unit sales in these markets of
4% and 6%, respectively, in fiscal 2003 compared to 2002. Additionally, several competitors of the Company have either targeted or announced their intention to target the education market for personal
computers, which could also negatively affect the Company's market share. In an effort to regain market share and remain competitive, the Company has been and will continue to pursue 1:1 learning
solutions in education. These 1:1 solutions and other strategic sales are generally priced more aggressively and could result in significantly less profitability or even in financial losses,
particularly for larger deals. Although the Company believes it has taken certain steps to strengthen its position in the education market, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to
increase or maintain its share of the education market or execute profitably on large strategic arrangements. Failure to do so may have an adverse impact on the Company's operating results and
financial condition. 


The Company's future operating performance is dependent on the performance of distributors and other resellers of the Company's products.  


The Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers and cataloguers, many of whom distribute products from competing
manufacturers. In addition, the Company also sells many of its products and resells certain third-party products in most of its major markets directly to end users, certain education customers, and
certain resellers through its online
stores around the world. The Company also sells its own products and certain third-party products through its retail stores. Many of the Company's significant resellers operate on narrow product
margins and have been negatively affected by current economic conditions. Considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with the Company's
distribution and retail channel partners. The Company's business and financial results could be adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weaken, if resellers within consumer
channels were to cease distribution of the Company's products, or if uncertainty regarding demand for the Company's products caused resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company's
products. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in various programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers' stores with Company employees. These programs could
require a substantial investment from the Company, while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue to offset this investment. 


Over
the past several years, an increasing proportion of the Company's net sales have been made by the Company directly to end-users through its online stores around the world and through
its retail stores in the United States. Some of the Company's resellers have perceived this expansion of the Company's direct sales as conflicting with their own business and economic interests as
distributors and resellers of the Company's products. Perception of such a conflict could discourage the Company's resellers from investing additional resources in the distribution and sale of the
Company's products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of the Company's products. The Company's business and financial results could be adversely affected if expansion of its direct sales to
end-users causes some or all of its resellers to cease or limit distribution of the Company's products. 


Further
information regarding risks associated with Marketing and Distribution may be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading "Markets and Distribution,"
which information is hereby incorporated by reference. 


46






 




The Company's business is subject to the risks of international operations.  


A large portion of the Company's revenue is derived from its international operations. As a result, the Company's operating results and financial condition could be
significantly affected by risks associated with international activities, including economic and labor conditions, political instability, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), and
changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the local currency in which the products are sold and goods and services are purchased. The Company's primary exposure to movements in foreign currency
exchange rates relate to non-dollar denominated sales in Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada, and certain parts of Asia and non-dollar denominated operating expenses incurred
throughout the world. Weaknesses in foreign currencies, particularly the Japanese Yen and the Euro, can adversely impact consumer demand for the Company's products and the U.S. dollar value of the
Company's foreign currency denominated sales. Conversely, strengthening in these and other foreign currencies can increase the cost to the Company of product components, negatively affecting the
Company's results of operations. 


Margins
on sales of Apple products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties. 


Derivative
instruments, such as foreign exchange forward and option positions, and interest rate swap and option positions have been utilized by the Company to hedge exposures to fluctuations in
interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either
foreign exchange or interest rates. 


Further
information related to the Company's global market risks may be found in Part II, Item 7A of this Form 10-K under the subheading "Foreign Currency Risk" and may be
found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Notes 1 and 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which information is hereby incorporated by reference. 


The Company's future performance is dependent upon support from third-party software developers. If third-party software applications cease to be developed or available for the
Company's hardware products, then customers may choose not to buy the Company's products.  


The Company believes that decisions by customers to purchase the Company's personal computers, as opposed to Windows-based systems, are often based on the availability of
third-party software for particular applications such as Microsoft Office. The Company also believes the availability of third-party application software for the Company's hardware products depends in
part on third-party developers' perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the Company's products versus software for the larger
Windows market. This analysis is based on factors such as the perceived strength of the Company and its products, the anticipated potential revenue that may be generated, acceptance by customers of
Mac OS X, and the costs of developing such software products. To the extent the Company's financial losses in prior years and the minority market share held by the Company in the personal computer
market, as well as the Company's decision to end its Mac OS licensing program, have caused software developers to question the Company's prospects in the personal computer market, developers could be
less inclined to develop new application software or upgrade existing software for the Company's products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the
larger Windows market. Moreover, there can be no assurance software developers will continue to develop software for Mac OS X, the Company's operating system, on a timely basis or at all. 


In
addition, past and future development by the Company of its own software applications and solutions may negatively impact the decision of software developers to develop, maintain, and upgrade
similar or competitive software for the Company's products. The Company currently markets and sells a variety of software applications for use by professionals, consumers, and education customers that
could influence 


47






 




the
decision of third-party software developers to develop or upgrade Macintosh-compatible software products. Software applications currently marketed by the Company include software for professional
film and video editing, professional compositing and visual effects for large format film and video productions, professional music production and music post production, professional and consumer DVD
encoding and authoring, consumer digital video and digital photo editing and management, digital music management, desktop-based database management, and high-quality presentations. The
Company also markets an integrated productivity application that incorporates word processing, page layout, image manipulation, spreadsheets, databases, and presentations in a single application. 


In
August 1997, the Company and Microsoft Corporation entered into patent cross license and technology agreements. In addition, for a period of five years through August 2002, and
subject to certain limitations related to the number of Macintosh computers sold by the Company, Microsoft was required to make versions of its Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer products for the
Mac OS. Although Microsoft has released Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer for Mac OS X, Microsoft is not obligated to produce future versions of its products subsequent to August 2002.
While the Company believes its relationship with Microsoft has been and will continue to be beneficial to the Company and to its efforts to increase the installed base for the Mac OS, the Company does
compete directly with Microsoft in a number of key areas. Accordingly, Microsoft's interest in producing application software for the Mac OS following expiration of the agreements may be influenced by
Microsoft's perception of its interests as the vendor of the Windows operating system. Discontinuance of Microsoft Office and other Microsoft products for the Macintosh platform would have an adverse
effect on the Company's net sales and results of operations. In June of 2003, Microsoft stated that it would no longer develop new versions of Internet Explorer for the Mac OS. Microsoft's decision to
discontinue development of Internet Explorer for Mac OS X appears to have been influenced in part by the Company's introduction during 2003 of its own web browser, Safari. It is unclear what impact,
if any, Microsoft's decision to cease further development of Internet Explorer for Mac OS X will have on the Company. However, if customers chose not to purchase the Company's products because
Internet Explorer is not available on the Macintosh platform or should websites fail to provide support for web browsers other than Internet Explorer, the Company's net sales and results of operations
could be materially adversely affected. 


The Company's business relies on access to patents and intellectual property obtained from third parties, and the Company's future results could be adversely affected if it is
alleged or found to have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others.  


Many of the Company's products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses
relating to various aspects of its products and business methods, the Company believes that based upon past experience and industry
practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available or available on acceptable
terms. 


Because
of technological changes in the computer industry, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible certain components of the Company's products
and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents of others. The Company has from time to time been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property
rights of others. Responding to such claims, regardless of their merit, can be time consuming, result in significant expenses, and cause the diversion of management and technical personnel. Several
pending claims are in various stages of evaluation. The Company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements in certain of these cases. However, no assurance can be given that
such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. In the event there is a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting the Company from marketing or selling
certain of its products or a successful claim of infringement against the Company requiring it to pay royalties to a third-party, the Company's future operating results and financial condition could
be adversely affected. Information regarding claims and litigation involving the Company related to alleged patent infringement and other matters is set forth in 


48






 




Part I,
Item 3 of this Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability for damages or royalties from any current legal proceedings or
claims related to the infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, or
financial condition. However, the results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of patent or
other intellectual property rights of others described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K or should several of these matters be resolved against the Company in the same
reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. 


The Company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons.  


The Company's profit margins vary among its products and its distribution channels. As a result, the overall profitability of the Company in any given period will depend, in
part, on the product, geographic, and channel mix reflected in that period's net sales. 


The typical concentration of net sales in the third month of the Company's fiscal quarters can adversely affect the Company's business and operating results.  


The Company generally sells more products during the third month of each quarter than it does during either of the first two months, a pattern typical in the personal computer
industry. This sales pattern can produce pressure on the Company's internal infrastructure during the third month of a quarter and may adversely impact the Company's ability to predict its financial
results accurately. Developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company's
products, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the Company's key logistics, components suppliers, or manufacturing partners, can have significant adverse impacts on the Company and its
results of operations and financial condition. 


The Company's success depends largely on its ability to attract and retain key personnel.  


Much of the future success of the Company depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, members of its
executive team, and those in technical, marketing and staff positions. Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense,
especially in the Silicon Valley, where the majority of the Company's employees are located. The Company has relied on its ability to grant stock options as one mechanism for recruiting and retaining
this highly skilled talent. Potential accounting regulations requiring the expensing of stock options may impair the Company's future ability to provide these incentives without incurring significant
compensation costs. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel. 


The Company is subject to risks associated with the availability and cost of insurance.  


The Company has observed rapidly changing conditions in the insurance markets relating to nearly all areas of traditional corporate insurance. Such conditions have resulted in
higher premium costs, higher policy deductibles, and lower coverage limits. For some risks, because of cost and/or availability, the Company does not have insurance coverage. For these reasons, the
Company is retaining a greater portion of its insurable risks than it has in the past at relatively greater cost. 


Business interruptions could adversely affect the Company's future operating results.  


The Company's major business operations are subject to interruption by earthquake, fire, power shortages, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, medical
conditions, and other events beyond its control. The majority of the Company's research and development activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical
business operations, including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are located near major seismic faults. The Company does not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related
losses. The Company's operating results and financial 


49






 


condition
could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster. 


Failure of the Company's information technology systems and breaches in the security of data could adversely affect the Company's future operating results.  


Information technology system failures and breaches of data security could disrupt the Company's ability to function in the normal course of business by potentially causing
delays or cancellation of customer orders, impeding the manufacture or shipment of products, or resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer or Company information. Management has taken steps
to address these concerns by its implementation of sophisticated network security and internal control measures. However, there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach will
not have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. 


The Company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivables. This risk is heightened as economic conditions worsen.  


The Company distributes its products through third-party computer resellers and retailers and directly to certain educational institutions and commercial customers. A
substantial majority of the Company's outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. The Company also has non-trade receivables from certain of its
manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale by the Company of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the
Company. While the Company has procedures in place to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and non-trade receivables, there can be no assurance that such procedures will
be effective in limiting its credit risk and avoiding losses. Additionally, if the global economy and regional economies fail to improve or continue to deteriorate, it becomes more likely that the
Company will incur a material loss or losses as a result of the weakening financial condition of one or more of its customers or manufacturing vendors. 


The Company is subject to risks associated with environmental regulations.  


Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the
requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and
regulations have recently been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including various European Union member countries, Japan and California. Although the Company does not
anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a
material adverse effect on the Company's results of operation and financial position. 


Changes in accounting rules could adversely affect the Company's future operating results.  


Financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These principles are subject to interpretation by various governing bodies,
including the FASB and the SEC, who interpret and create appropriate accounting regulations. A change from current accounting
regulations can have a significant effect on the Company's results of operations and could impact the manner in which the Company conducts business. 


Unanticipated changes in the Company's tax rates could affect its future results.  


The Company's future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax
rates, changes in the valuation of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation. In addition, the Company is subject to the continuous
examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes 


50






 


resulting
from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse
effect on its operating results and financial condition. 


The Company's stock price may be volatile.  


The Company's stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between its actual and anticipated financial results and as a result of
announcements by the Company and its competitors. In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies
in ways that have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These factors, including lack of positive performance in the Company's stock price, as well as general economic and
political conditions and investors' concerns regarding the credibility of corporate financial reporting and integrity of financial markets, may materially adversely affect the market price of the
Company's stock in the future. 


The Company's acquisition activity could disrupt its ongoing business and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transaction.  


The Company has acquired and may continue to acquire companies that have products, services, personnel and technologies that complement the Company's strategic direction and
product roadmap. These acquisitions may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including difficulties in incorporating the acquired companies' operations and technologies; distraction of
management's attention away from normal business operations; insufficient revenue generation to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with acquisition; and unidentified issues not
discovered in the Company's due diligence process, including product quality issues and legal contingencies. Acquisitions are inherently risky, and no assurance can be given that the Company's
previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect business, operating results or financial condition. The Company has generally paid cash for its
acquisitions. Should the Company issue its common stock or other equity
related purchase rights as consideration in an acquisition, current shareholders' percentage ownership and earnings per share may become diluted.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    
 


Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management  


To ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's foreign exchange and interest rate hedge positions, as well as to monitor the risks and opportunities of the
non-hedge portfolios, the Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions, and its interest rate swap and option positions both on a stand-alone basis and in
conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures, respectively, from both an accounting and an economic perspective. However, given the effective horizons of the
Company's risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures intended to hedge, there can be no assurance the aforementioned programs will offset more than a portion of the
adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to
mark-to-market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely
affect the Company's operating results and financial position. The Company adopted SFAS No. 133 as of October 1, 2000. SFAS No. 133 established accounting and reporting standards
for derivative instruments, hedging activities, and exposure definition. Management does not believe that ongoing application of SFAS No. 133 will significantly alter the Company's hedging
strategies. However, its application may increase the volatility of other income and expense and other comprehensive income. 


Interest Rate Risk  


While the Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world's leading industrialized countries, the Company's interest income and expense is most sensitive
to fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. In this regard, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and
short-term investments as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges. 


The
Company's fixed income investment policy and strategy is to ensure the preservation of capital, meet liquidity requirements, and optimize return in light of the current credit and interest rate
environment. The Company benchmarks its performance by utilizing external money managers to manage a small portion of the aggregate investment portfolio. The external managers adhere to the Company's
investment policies and also provide occasional research and market information that supplements internal research used to make credit decisions in the investment process. 


During
1994, the Company issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 6.5% unsecured notes in a public offering registered with the SEC. The notes were sold at 99.925% of par, for an
effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. The notes pay interest semiannually and mature on February 15, 2004. 


The
Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company's investment portfolio and debt obligations and related derivative financial instruments. The
Company places its short-term investments in highly liquid securities issued by high credit quality issuers and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The
Company's general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk. All highly liquid investments with maturities of three
months or less are classified as cash equivalents; highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as short-term investments. As of September 27,
2003, approximately $629 million of the Company's short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 and 5 years. As of September 28, 2002,
$1.087 billion of the Company's investment portfolio classified as short-term investments had maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remainder all had underlying
maturities between 3 and 12 months. Due to liquidity needs, or in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for the purpose of duration management of the Company's investment portfolio, the
Company may sell investments prior to their stated maturities. As a result of such activity, the Company recognized net gains of $21 million in 2003 and $7 million in 2002. 


52






 




In
order to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company's investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that a
change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 27,
2003, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $12.9 million decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. As of
September 28, 2002, a similar 100 basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a $37.7 million decline in fair value. Such losses would only be realized if the Company
sold the investments prior to maturity. Except in instances noted above, the Company's policy is to hold investments to maturity. 


The
Company sometimes enters into interest rate derivative transactions, including interest rate swaps, collars, and floors, with financial institutions in order to better match the Company's
floating-rate interest income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on its debt, and/or to diversify a portion
of the Company's exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. The Company may also enter into interest rate contracts that are intended to reduce the cost of the
interest rate risk management program. The Company entered into no interest rate asset swaps during 2003 or 2002 and had no open interest rate asset swaps at September 27, 2003. 


In
prior years, the Company had entered into interest rate debt swaps with financial institutions. The interest rate debt swaps, which qualified as accounting hedges, generally required the Company to
pay a floating interest rate based on the three- or six-month U.S. dollar LIBOR and receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of the underlying notional amounts. These swaps
effectively converted the Company's fixed-rate 10-year debt to floating-rate debt and convert a portion of the floating rate investments to fixed rate. Due to
prevailing market interest rates, during 2002 the Company entered into and then subsequently closed out debt swap positions realizing a gain of $6 million. During 2001 the Company closed out
all of its then existing debt swap positions realizing a gain of $17 million. Both the gains in 2002 and 2001 were deferred, recognized in long-term debt and are being amortized to
other income and expense over the remaining life of the debt. 


Foreign Currency Risk  


Overall, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar and, as such, generally benefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger
dollar relative to major currencies worldwide. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may negatively affect the Company's net sales and gross
margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is also a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing within the time frame of our hedged positions due to competitive
pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. 


The
Company enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions primarily to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities,
certain firmly committed transactions, and probable but not firmly committed transactions. Generally, the Company's practice is to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange
transaction exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, and limited
availability of appropriate hedging instruments. The Company also enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the
re-measurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies of its foreign subsidiaries. 


In
order to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company's foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis
using a value-at-risk (VAR) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate 3000
random market price paths. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company's foreign 


53






 




exchange
portfolio due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The model assumes normal market
conditions. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company
estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $7.5 million as of September 27, 2003 compared to a maximum one-day loss of
$3.8 million as of September 28, 2002. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, losses incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases
in the fair value of the underlying exposures. 


Actual
gains and losses in the future associated with the Company's investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of
September 27, 2003 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and amount of interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates, and the Company's actual
exposures and positions.

This
section and other parts of this Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company's actual results may differ significantly from
the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the subsection entitled "Factors That May Affect
Future Results and Financial Condition" below. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8 of this
Form 10-K. All information presented herein is based on the Company's fiscal calendar. 


Critical Accounting Policies  


The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and the Company's discussion and analysis of its
financial condition and results of operations requires the Company's management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements
and accompanying notes. Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in
the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial
statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 


Management
believes the following to be critical accounting policies. That is, they are both important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results, and they require management to
make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. 


Revenue Recognition  


The Company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards, including Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97-2, 
Software
Revenue Recognition
, as amended, and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, 
Revenue Recognition in
Financial Statements
. SAB 101, as amended, summarizes certain of the SEC's views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial
statements and provides guidance on revenue recognition issues in the absence of authoritative literature addressing a specific arrangement or a specific industry. 


The
Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is probable. Product is considered
delivered to the customer once it has been shipped, and title and risk of loss have been transferred. Revenue on multiple element sales arrangements is allocated to various elements based on vendor
specific objective evidence of the fair value of each element of the transaction and is recognized as each element is delivered. 


The
Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end user rebates and other sales programs
and volume-based incentives. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that
could result in incremental reductions of revenue at the time such programs are offered. Additionally, certain customer 


19






 





incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular
incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue. 


Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  


The Company distributes its products through third-party computer resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and commercial customers. The Company generally does
not require collateral from its customers. However, when possible, the Company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables through the use of flooring arrangements for selected customers
with third-party financing companies and credit insurance for certain customers in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. However, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral, flooring
arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Company's distribution and retail channel partners. 


The
allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management's assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition
of those specific customers. The Company records an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that is reasonably believed to be collectible. The Company also records an allowance for
all other trade receivables based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts, the general economic environment, the financial condition of the Company's distribution channels,
and the aging of such receivables. If there is a deterioration of a major customer's financial condition, if the Company becomes aware of additional information related to the credit worthiness of a
major customer, or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the Company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts, which
would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made. 


Inventory Valuation and Inventory Purchase Commitments  


The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. The Company records a write-down for inventories of
components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed
review of inventory each period that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product lifecycle status, product development plans, and component cost trends. The personal computer
industry is subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence. If future demand or market conditions for the Company's products are less favorable than forecasted or if
unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory, the Company may be required to record additional write-downs which would negatively affect gross margins in the
period when the write-downs are made. 


The
Company accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees related to component orders that have been canceled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a
combination of formal purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. These formal and informal commitments typically cover the Company's requirements for
periods ranging from 30 to 130 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Company's products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements
for any of the Company's products, the Company may be required to record additional reserves for cancellation fees, negatively affecting gross margins in the period when the cancellation fees are
identified. 


Valuation of Long-Lived Assets Including Acquired Intangibles  


The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying
amount of such an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate.
If such assets are considered to be 


20






 



impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value. Although the Company has recognized no material
impairment adjustments related to its property, plant, and equipment or identifiable intangibles during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions,
deterioration in the Company's business in a geographic region or business segment in the future, including deterioration in the performance of individual retail stores, could lead to such impairment
adjustments in the future periods in which such business issues are identified. 


As
of September 28, 2002, the Company had $85 million in goodwill. The Company adopted SFAS No. 142, 
Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets
, in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. As a result, the Company no longer amortizes goodwill but instead performs a review of goodwill for impairment annually, or earlier
if indicators of potential impairment exist. The review of goodwill for potential impairment is highly subjective and requires that: (1) goodwill be allocated to various business units of the
Company's business to which it relates; (2) the Company estimate the fair value of those business units to which the goodwill relates; and (3) the Company determine the book value of
those business units. If the estimated fair value of business units with allocated goodwill is determined to be less than their book value, the Company is required to estimate the fair value of all
identifiable assets and liabilities of those business units in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. This requires independent valuation of certain internally
developed and unrecognized assets including in-process research and development and developed technology. Once this process is complete, the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, can be
determined. 


Based
on the Company's estimates as of September 28, 2002, there was no impairment of goodwill. However, changes in various circumstances including changes in the Company's market
capitalization, changes in the Company's forecasts, and changes in the Company's internal business structure could cause one or more of the Company's business units to be valued differently thereby
causing an impairment of goodwill. Additionally, in response to changes in the personal computer industry and changes in global or regional economic conditions, the Company may strategically realign
its resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of property, plant, and equipment, identifiable intangibles, or goodwill. 


Valuation of Non-Current Debt and Equity Investments  


As of September 28, 2002, the Company held investments in certain debt and equity securities with a combined carrying value of $39 million. These investments,
which are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as non-current debt and equity investments, have been categorized as available-for-sale requiring that they
be carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in
equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company recognizes an impairment charge to earnings when it is judged an investment has experienced a decline in value that is
other-than-temporary. The Company has recognized material impairment charges related to its non-current debt and equity investments in two quarters during the last
two fiscal years. Various factors are considered in determining whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary, including the length of time and extent to which the
investment's market value has been less than its cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the Company's intent and ability to hold the investment for
a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. 


The
Company's non-current debt and equity investments are in public companies whose security prices are subject to significant volatility. The Company recognized a pre-tax
impairment loss of $50 million related to two of these investments in the fourth quarter of 2002. As a result, as of September 28, 2002, the Company had no significant unrealized gains
or losses recorded against the carrying value of its non-current debt and equity investments. Should the fair value of these investments fall below the Company's current cost bases and/or
the financial condition or prospects of either company deteriorate, the Company may determine in a future period that such a decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, 


21






 





requiring an impairment loss be recognized in the period such a determination is made. Additional information regarding these investments and potential charges related to their impairment may be
found below under the caption "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition."

(a)
Includes
server sales and amounts previously reported as Power Macintosh G4 Cube.

(b)
Based
on net sales associated with Macintosh units and total Macintosh units sold. 


Net
sales increased $379 million or 7% during 2002 compared to 2001, while Macintosh unit sales were relatively flat year-over-year at approximately 3.1 million
units. On a geographic basis, performance in the domestic market was relatively strong, especially when considering the performance of the Company's Retail segment which currently operates exclusively
in the United States. However, the European and Japanese markets remained sluggish throughout 2002. The Company's net sales in 2002 were positively influenced by a number of factors. 


First,
net sales from software, service, and other sources rose $248 million or 26% in 2002 versus 2001. This increase was driven by several factors including a 28% increase in combined
third-party and Apple- 


22






 





branded software sales; $143 million in net sales of iPod, the Company's portable digital music player that was introduced in the first half of 2002; a 9% increase in the sale of computer
accessories; and a 14% increase in service revenue caused primarily by increased revenue associated with extended maintenance and support contracts. The growth in software revenue was primarily the
result of increased sales of third-party software in the Company's retail and online stores and expansion in recent years in the number of Apple-branded software titles. 


Second,
overall unit sales of Macintosh portable systems grew by 92,000 units or 10% in 2002 reflecting a general trend in the personal computer market away from desktop systems towards portable
systems. During 2002, portable Macintosh systems represented 33% of total systems sales versus 31% in 2001 and 20% in 2000. Growth in this area has been most pronounced for iBook, the Company's
education and consumer oriented portable Macintosh system. iBook unit sales increased 14% in 2002 and 9% in 2001. 


Third,
the Company's Retail segment grew from 8 stores at the end of 2001 to 40 stores at the end of 2002. The Retail segment's net sales grew from $19 million in 2001 to $283 million in
2002. While the Retail segment may cannibalize some net sales from the Company's preexisting sales channels in the U.S., the Company does believe that a substantial portion of the Retail segment's net
sales are incremental to the Company's total net sales. See additional comments below related to the Retail segment under the heading "Segment Operating Performance." 


Fourth,
the Company's average unit pricing remained relatively stable during 2002 as a result of various changes in overall unit mix offset by somewhat lower pricing
year-over-year on comparative Macintosh systems. Net sales per Macintosh unit sold during 2002 of $1,462 per unit reflects the shift in mix towards relatively higher-priced
portable Macintosh systems and reflects the impact on net sales of the relatively higher-priced new iMac design introduced during 2002. The impact of these changes in mix were offset by the decline in
unit sales of relatively higher-priced Power Macintosh systems and by lower pricing on comparative Macintosh systems during 2002 for most of the Company's Macintosh product lines in response to
industry pricing pressure. 


Fifth,
any comparison of net sales in 2002 versus 2001 must consider the effect of unusually low net sales during the first quarter of 2001. As discussed below, this was attributable to several
factors at the beginning of 2001, including continuing deterioration in worldwide demand for personal computers, rebate programs and price cuts instituted by the Company during that quarter that cost
the Company approximately $138 million, and a plan implemented by the Company during the first quarter of 2001 to reduce substantially the level of inventory in its distribution channels that
resulted in a decline in channel inventory of approximately 300,000 units during that quarter. Net sales during the first quarter of 2001 are discussed in more detail below. 


Offsetting
the favorable factors discussed above, the Company's net sales in 2002 were negatively impacted by several notable factors. First, unit sales of Power Macintosh systems fell 18% during 2002
as compared to 2001. This followed a 35% decline in Power Macintosh unit sales in 2001 from 2000. The Company continues to believe that weak economic conditions over the past several years are having
a pronounced negative impact on its professional and creative customers and that many of these customers continue to delay upgrades of their Power Macintosh systems due to the Company's ongoing
transition to Mac OS X, its new operating system, and in anticipation of certain software vendors transitioning their Macintosh applications to run natively in Mac OS X. Further, the Company did not
experience the anticipated increase in Power Macintosh sales that it expected following the introduction of Adobe's PhotoShop 7 during 2002. Additionally, many professional users may have postponed
upgrading their systems until after the introduction of Mac OS X Jaguar released in the fourth quarter
of 2002. Others may have delayed upgrading until after the availability of other professionally oriented software applications for Mac OS X such as QuarkXpress.

Second, despite the overall increase in net sales during 2002 in the Americas, the Company continues to see weakness in its U.S. education channel. Total net sales in this channel fell 15% in 2002 and
4% in 2001. These declines are consistent with industry data that shows the Company losing market share in the U.S. education market in each of the last two fiscal years. The Company believes this
weakness has been caused by multiple factors, including increased price competition in this price sensitive market from the Company's competitors who sell Windows-based personal computers.
Additionally, some of the Company's education customers appear to be delaying technology purchases due to concerns about the overall impact of the weaker economy on their available funding. The
Company continues to take steps to address weakness in the U.S. education channel. However, it is difficult to anticipate how this trend will affect fiscal 2003 and to anticipate when and if this
trend will reverse. 


Third,
the personal computer industry in general and the Company specifically continue to see relatively soft demand for its products. Despite an overall increase in unit sales of consumer oriented
Macintosh systems during 2002, consumer sales remain far below levels experienced in 2000 and earlier. Worsening global economic conditions over the past three years exacerbated by the economic and
political uncertainties caused by terrorist activities and the associated international responses have clearly had a pronounced negative effect on the overall demand for the Company's products in
virtually all of its markets. Further, growth in the overall personal computer industry has been slowed due to the high market penetration of personal computers and a lengthening of consumer,
creative, and business personal computer upgrade cycles. In short, the Company believes that expansion in the overall market for personal computers has for the most part stalled and that growth awaits
a combination of economic recovery and technological advancements. 


Net
sales decreased $2.6 billion or 33% during 2001 compared to 2000, while Macintosh unit sales fell 32% from 2000. Demand for all of the Company's products in all of the Company's geographic
operating segments was negatively impacted throughout 2001 by unfavorable global economic conditions. On a year-over-year basis, net sales and Macintosh unit sales were down in
all of the Company's geographic operating segments, and net sales and unit sales by product were down for each Macintosh product category except iBook. In addition to general economic conditions, two
other primary factors contributed to the decline in net sales during 2001. First, as discussed below, the Company executed a plan during the first three quarters of 2001 to reduce substantially the
level of inventory in its distribution channels. As a result of these efforts, the Company's Macintosh channel inventory fell by approximately 450,000 units during the first nine months of 2001.
Second, the Company believes that many of its professional users were delaying upgrades of their Power Macintosh systems due to the Company's ongoing transition to Mac OS X, its new operating system,
and in anticipation of software vendors transitioning their Mac applications to run natively in Mac OS X. 


Several
positive factors combined to partially mitigate the overall decline in net sales during 2001. The net sales per Macintosh unit sold remained relatively strong during 2001 after adjusting for
the $138 million impact to net sales of the rebate programs and price cuts instituted by the Company during the first quarter of 2001, falling only about 2.5% from 2000. The relatively strong
per unit sales in 2001 reflects somewhat lower year-over-year pricing on comparative systems, offset by a shift in overall sales mix toward higher-priced portable systems.
Also, the Company experienced very little shift in the mix of overall combined unit sales of relatively lower-priced consumer and education Macintosh systems, iMac and iBook, and their higher-priced
professionally oriented equivalents. Combined unit sales of iMac and iBook systems accounted for 58% of total Macintosh unit sales in 2001 and 60% in 2000. Second, combined unit sales of portable
systems, iBook and PowerBook, actually rose 2% during 2001 despite the negative economic climate and the overall decline in unit sales. Not only does this increase in portable system sales reflect a
general industry shift toward portable systems, it is also specifically attributable to the strong demand for redesigned iBooks introduced during the third quarter of 2001 and for the Titanium
PowerBook G4 which was introduced during the second quarter of 2001. Third, a small decline in net sales 


24






 





in the U.S. education market during 2001 compared to 2000 was partially mitigated by a 7% increase in U.S. education unit sales during 2001. 


First
quarter 2001 net sales decreased 57% to $1.007 billion compared to the same quarter in 2000 and decreased 46% from the fourth quarter of 2000. Both the
year-over-year and sequential declines in net sales during the first quarter of 2001 were attributable to several factors, including continued deterioration in worldwide demand
for personal computers and rebate programs and price cuts instituted by the Company during the quarter that cost the Company approximately $138 million. In addition, the Company implemented a
plan during the first quarter to reduce substantially the level of inventory in its distribution channels from the amounts at the end of fiscal 2000 to lower levels by the end of the first quarter of
2001. The Company ended fiscal 2000 with substantially more inventory in its distribution channels than planned due to the lower than expected sell-through of the Company's products during
the fourth quarter of that year. The Company reduced Macintosh channel inventory during the first quarter by approximately 300,000 units. These factors contributed to the 52%
year-over-year decline during the first quarter in total Macintosh unit sales that were experienced across the Company's entire product line. These factors also reduced the net
sales per Macintosh unit sold (a function of total net sales associated with Macintosh units and total Macintosh CPU unit sales) during the first quarter of 2001 to $1,476, a decline of approximately
12% from the same period in 2000. 


Segment Operating Performance  


The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable operating segments include the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas
segment includes both North and South America, except for the Company's Retail segment. The European segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Japan segment
includes only Japan. The Retail segment operates Apple-owned retail stores in the United States. Each reportable geographic operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and
similar services. Further information regarding the Company's operating segments may be found in Part II, Item 8 on this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements at Note 11, "Segment Information and Geographic Data." 


Americas  


Net sales for the Americas segment increased 3% or $92 million in 2002. As discussed above, the Americas segment was negatively affected by a decline in U.S. education
sales in 2002 of $215 million. The Americas segment also experienced a 17% decline in Power Macintosh unit sales. However, outside of the U.S. education channel, unit sales of consumer desktop
and portable systems rebounded from the substantial declines experienced in 2001, rising a combined 31% in 2002. Sales of software, peripherals, and accessories were also up in the Americas during
2002. Growth in unit sales of consumer oriented systems during 2002 in the Americas is somewhat attributable to the significantly depressed level of net sales experienced in the first quarter of 2001
discussed above. However, growth in the Americas was somewhat negatively affected, particularly with respect to consumer-oriented systems, by the significant growth of the Company's Retail segment in
the U.S. More than 70% of the Retail segment's Macintosh unit sales during 2002 were for iMacs and iBooks. 


The
Americas segment's 2001 net sales and unit sales declined 30% and 29%, respectively, from 2000. The operating performance of the Americas segment for 2001 reflects the Company's overall
performance characterized by significant declines in year-over-year quarterly net sales and units sales, particularly during the first quarter and particularly in consumer
channels, with sequential increases in unit sales and net sales during each of the last three quarters of 2001. Net sales in the Americas segment during 2001 were also negatively affected by the
Company's overall reduction in channel inventories during the year. Consumer sales in the Americas were particularly hard hit by current economic conditions. Outside of the U.S. education channel,
unit sales of the Company's consumer oriented iMac fell 64% in 2001. The effect of falling consumer demand in the Americas segment was partially offset by strong U.S. education sales. The Company's
unit sales in U.S. education markets rose 7% in 2001 driven by the acceptance of the 


25






 





Company's new portable products, particularly the iBook, and reflect a general shift in demand in the U.S. education market towards portable versus desktop systems. Portable systems accounted for 28%
of total unit sales in the Company's U.S. education market in 2001 compared to 18% during 2000. 


During
2002 and 2001, the Americas segment represented approximately 54% and 56%, respectively, of the Company's total net sales and represented approximately 56% and 57%, respectively, of total
Macintosh unit sales. 


Europe  


Economic conditions in Europe remained weak throughout 2002, and the overall demand for the Company's products in that region remained flat during 2002 versus 2001. Unit sales
in Europe for 2002 reflect relatively stronger demand for consumer-oriented products, particularly iBook whose unit sales increased 27% in 2002, offset by declines in Power Macintosh unit sales. 


Net
sales in Europe fell $568 million or 31% during 2001 compared to 2000, while Europe's unit sales fell 32%. Europe's results reflect the worsening economic climate in Europe in the latter
half of 2001 and reductions in channel inventories as experienced in the Company's other geographic operating segments. Combined unit sales of the Company's consumer oriented products in Europe were
particularly impacted during 2001, falling 40% from 2000. 


Japan  


Net sales in Japan remained flat during 2002 versus 2001, with a slight decline in unit sales of 2%. Consistent with the Company's other geographic operating segments, during
2002 Japan showed growth in unit sales of consumer systems and a decline in unit sales of Power Macintosh systems. Japan's iMac unit sales increased 85% in 2002. However, in the case of Japan the
increase in iMac unit shipments in 2002 versus 2001 was primarily the result of the unusually depressed level of net sales experienced by the Company in the first quarter of 2001 discussed above.
Additionally, net sales in Japan on a sequential and year-over-year comparative basis generally worsened as 2002 progressed reflecting particularly poor economic conditions
that currently exist in Japan. 


Net
sales and unit sales in Japan fell 47% and 46%, respectively, in 2001 versus 2000. Although unit sales and net sales in Japan have generally trended upwards as 2001 progressed, the Japan segment
has been particularly affected by current unfavorable economic conditions. Reflecting the continuing harsh consumer climate in Japan, the Japan segment's combined unit sales of iMacs and iBooks during
2001 were down 58% from 2000, and professionally oriented systems unit sales fell 30%. 


Retail  


By the end of September 2002, the Company had 40 retail stores operating in the United States, 32 of which were opened during fiscal 2002. The Company has opened 11
additional stores during the first quarter of 2003. During 2002, approximately 39% of the Retail segment's net sales came from the sale of Apple-branded and third-party peripherals and software. This
compares to 21% for the Company as a whole. With an average of 35 stores open, the Retail segment achieved average annualized revenue per store during the fourth quarter of approximately
$12 million and had approximately 2.25 million visitors. The Retail segment reported a loss for all of 2002 of $22 million, and a loss for the fourth quarter of 2002 of
$3 million. 


Expansion
of the Retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure, operating lease commitments, personnel, and other
operating expenses. Capital expenditures associated with the Retail segment totaled $106 million in 2002 and $92 million in 2001. As of September 28, 2002, the Retail segment had
807 employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with retail store space and related facilities of $209 million. The Company would incur substantial costs should it
choose to terminate its Retail segment or close individual stores. Such costs could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Investment 


26






 





in a new business model such as the Retail segment is inherently risky, particularly in light of the significant investment involved, the current economic climate, and the fixed nature of a
substantial portion of the Retail segment's operating expenses. Results for this segment are dependent upon a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are discussed below under the heading
"Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition." 


Backlog  


In the Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects. In particular, backlog
often increases in anticipation of or immediately following new product introductions because of over-ordering by dealers anticipating shortages. Backlog often is reduced once dealers and
customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, backlog cannot be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or
financial performance. Further information regarding the Company's backlog may be found below under the heading "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition."

Gross
margin increased to 28% of net sales in 2002 from 23% in 2001. As discussed below, gross margin in 2001 was unusually low resulting from negative gross margin of 2% experienced in the first
quarter of 2001. As a percentage of net sales, the Company's quarterly gross margins declined during fiscal 2002 from 31% in the first quarter down to 26% in the fourth quarter. This decline resulted
from several factors including a rise in component costs as the year progressed and aggressive pricing by the Company across its products lines instituted as a result of continued pricing pressures in
the personal computer industry. The Company anticipates that its gross margin and the gross margin of the overall personal computer industry will remain under pressure throughout fiscal 2003 in light
of weak economic conditions, flat demand for personal computers in general, and the resulting pressure on prices. 


The
foregoing statements regarding anticipated gross margin in 2003 and the general demand for personal computers during 2003 are forward-looking. Gross margin could differ from anticipated levels
because of several factors, including certain of those set forth below in the subsection entitled "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition." There can be no assurance that
current gross margins will be maintained, targeted gross margin levels will be achieved, or current margins on existing individual products will be maintained. In general, gross margins and margins on
individual products will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product
life cycles, potential increases in the cost and availability of raw material and outside manufacturing services, and potential changes to the Company's product mix, including higher unit sales of
consumer products with lower average selling prices and lower gross margins. In response to these downward pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its
products. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company's ability to effectively manage quality problems and warranty costs and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. The Company's
operating strategy and pricing take into account anticipated changes in foreign 


27






 





currency exchange rates over time; however, the Company's results of operations can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates. 


The
Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product shipments. Because the Company's markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there
is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products or components. The Company's operating results and
financial condition have been in the past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the Company's ability to manage its inventory levels and outstanding purchase commitments and to
respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns. 


Gross
margin declined to 23% of net sales in 2001 from 27% in 2000. This decline resulted primarily from gross margin of negative 2% experienced during the first quarter of 2001 compared to 26% gross
margin for the same quarter in 2000. In addition to lower than normal net sales, first quarter 2001 margins were negatively impacted by the rebate programs and price cuts discussed above that
decreased revenue by approximately $138 million. Additionally, actual and forecasted declines in net sales caused the Company to recognize during the first quarter of 2001 approximately
$122 million of charges associated with purchase order cancellations and loss commitments for component purchases. Without these charges, gross margin for the first quarter of 2001 would have
been approximately 21%, and gross margin for all of 2001 would have been approximately 27%. As a percentage of net sales, the Company's gross margin increased each quarter as 2001 progressed reaching
30% during the fourth quarter. This pattern reflects the favorable impact during 2001 of declining component costs, especially for DRAM, hard drives, and flat panel screens.

Research and Development (R&D)  


The Company recognizes that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely
development of new and enhanced products that are central to the Company's core business strategy. R&D expense increased 4% or $16 million to $446 million in 2002 as compared to 2001.
This followed a $50 million or 13% increase in 2001 as compared to 2000. The overall increase in R&D expense over the last two years relates primarily to increased R&D headcount and support for
new product development activities. R&D spending in 2002 also included capitalized software development costs of approximately $13.3 million associated with the development of Mac OS X
Jaguar and approximately $6 million associated with the new PowerSchool enterprise student information system. R&D spending in 2001 also included capitalized software development costs of
approximately $5.4 million associated with the development of the original version of Mac OS X. Further information related to the Company's capitalization of software development costs
may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 


Selling, General, and Administrative Expense (SG&A)  


SG&A decreased $27 million or 2% during 2002 as compared to 2001. The decrease in SG&A in 2002 is primarily the result of lower discretionary spending on marketing and
advertising expenses, decreased spending related to information systems, and benefits directly related to the Company's restructuring 


28






 



actions in 2002 and 2001. These decreases were partially offset by higher sales expense in 2002 resulting from increased operating expenses associated with expansion of the Company's Retail segment.
SG&A expenditures decreased $28 million or 2% during 2001 as compared to 2000. Declines in SG&A spending in both 2002 and 2001 reflect the Company's overall efforts to stabilize and selectively
reduce recurring SG&A costs in light of lower net sales and to reduce discretionary marketing and advertising expenses. Given current economic conditions and the Company's continued strategic
investments in new product development and its Retail segment, the Company is currently identifying additional opportunities to make appropriate reductions in SG&A costs.

2002 Restructuring Actions  


During fiscal 2002, the Company recorded total restructuring charges of $30 million related to actions intended to eliminate certain activities and better align the
Company's operating expenses with existing general economic conditions and to partially offset the cost of continuing investments in new product development and investments in the Company's Retail
operating segment. Once fully implemented, the Company estimates these restructuring actions will result in reduced quarterly operating expenses of approximately $10 million. 


Of
the $30 million restructuring charge for fiscal 2002, $6 million was incurred in the fourth quarter of 2002 related to actions designed to reduce headcount costs in Corporate
operations and sales and to adjust its PowerSchool product strategy. Headcount actions, primarily in Corporate operations, sales, and PowerSchool related research and development, resulted in the
elimination of approximately 180 positions worldwide at a cost of $1.8 million. The shift in product strategy at PowerSchool included discontinuing development and marketing of a PowerSchool
product that resulted in the impairment of previously capitalized development costs associated with the product in the amount of $4.5 million. The remaining charge in 2002 of $24 million
was incurred in the first quarter of 2002 and will ultimately result in the elimination of approximately 425 positions worldwide, 415 of which were eliminated by September 28, 2002, at a cost
of $8 million. Positions were eliminated primarily in the Company's operations, information systems, and administrative functions. In addition, these restructuring actions also included
significant changes in the Company's information systems strategy resulting in termination of equipment leases and cancellation of existing projects and activities. Related lease and contract
cancellation charges totaled $12 million, and charges for asset impairments totaled $4 million. Of the total charge in 2002 of $30 million, substantially all had been spent by
September 28, 2002, except for approximately $1 million related primarily to future payments on abandoned operating leases. 


2000 Restructuring Actions  


During the first quarter of 2000, the Company initiated restructuring actions resulting in recognition of an $8 million restructuring charge. This charge was comprised
of $3 million for the write-off of various operating assets and $5 million for severance payments to approximately 95 employees associated with consolidation of various
domestic and international sales and marketing functions. Of the $5 million accrued for severance, $2.5 million had been spent before the end of 2000, and the remainder was spent in
2001. Of the $3 million accrued for the write-off of various assets, substantially all was utilized before the end of 2000. 


29






 


Purchased In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D)  


During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company acquired Emagic GmbH, a provider of professional software solutions for computer based music production, for approximately
$30 million in cash; $551,000 of which was allocated to IPR&D. The amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition, because the technological feasibility of
products under development had not been established and no alternative future uses existed. The IPR&D relates primarily to Emagic's Logic series technology and extensions. At the date of the
acquisition, the products under development were between 43%-83% complete, and it was expected that the remaining work would be completed during the Company's fiscal 2003 at a cost of
approximately $415,000. The remaining efforts include finalizing user interface design and development, and testing. The fair value of the IPR&D was determined by an independent third-party valuation
using the income approach, which reflects the projected free cash flows that will be generated by the IPR&D projects and that are attributable to the acquired technology, and discounting the projected
net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 25%. 


In
May 2001, the Company acquired PowerSchool, Inc. (PowerSchool), a provider of web-based student information systems for K-12 schools and districts that enables
schools to record, access, report, and manage their student data and performance in real-time, and gives parents real-time web access to track their children's progress. Of
total purchase consideration of $66.1 million, $10.8 million was allocated to IPR&D and was expensed upon acquisition because the technological feasibility of products under development
had not been established and no alternative future uses existed. The IPR&D relates to technologies representing processes and expertise employed to design, develop, and deploy a functioning, scalable
web-based student information system for use by K-12 schools. At the date of the acquisition, the PowerSchool product under development was approximately 50% complete, and it
was expected that the remaining 50% would be completed during the Company's fiscal 2002 at a cost of approximately $9.25 million. The remaining efforts, which were completed during 2002,
included completion of coding, finalizing user interface design and development, and testing. The fair value of the IPR&D was determined by an independent third-party valuation using the income
approach, which reflects the projected free cash flows that will be generated by the IPR&D projects and that are attributable to the acquired technology, and discounting the projected net cash flows
back to their present value using a discount rate of 25%. 


Executive Bonus  


During the first quarter of 2000, the Company's Board of Directors approved a special executive bonus for the Company's Chief Executive Officer for past services in the form of
an aircraft with a total cost to the Company of approximately $90 million, the majority of which was not tax deductible. Approximately half of the total charge was for the cost of the aircraft.
The other half represents all other costs and taxes associated with the bonus. In the fourth quarter of 2002, all significant work and payments associated with the aircraft were complete. Of the
original $90 million accrual, $2.4 million remained unspent at the end of fiscal 2002 and was reversed.

Gains and Losses on Non-current Investments  


Investments categorized as non-current debt and equity investments on the consolidated balance sheet are in equity and debt instruments of public companies. The
Company's non-current debt and equity investments, and certain investments in private companies carried in other assets, have been categorized as available-for-sale
requiring that they be carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. However, the Company
recognizes an impairment charge to earnings in the event a decline in fair value below the cost basis of one of these investments is determined to be other-than-temporary. The
Company includes recognized gains and losses resulting from the sale or from other-than-temporary declines in fair value associated with these investments in other income and
expense. Further information related to the Company's non-current debt and equity investments may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Note 2
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 


During
2002, the Company determined that declines in the fair value of certain of these investments were other-than-temporary. As a result, the Company recognized a
$44 million charge to earnings to write-down the basis of its investment in EarthLink, Inc. (EarthLink), a $6 million charge to earnings to write-down the
basis of its investment in Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai), and a $15 million charge to earnings to write-down the basis of its investment in a private company investment.
These losses in 2002 were partially offset by the sale of 117,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds of $2 million and a gain before taxes of $223,000, the sale of 250,000 shares of
Akamai stock for net proceeds of $2 million and a gain before taxes of $710,000, and the sale of approximately 4.7 million shares of ARM Holdings plc (ARM) stock for both net proceeds
and a gain before taxes of $21 million. 


During
2001, the Company sold a total of approximately 1 million shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of $39 million and recorded a gain before taxes of $36 million, and sold a
total of approximately 29.8 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of $176 million and recorded a gain before taxes of $174 million. These gains during 2001 were partially
offset by a $114 million charge to earnings that reflected an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of the Company's investment in EarthLink and an
$8 million charge that reflected an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of certain private company investments. During 2000, the Company sold a total of
approximately 45.2 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of $372 million and a gain before taxes of $367 million. 


The
combined carrying value of the Company's investments in EarthLink, Akamai, and ARM as of September 28, 2002, was $39 million. The Company believes it is likely there will continue to
be significant fluctuations in the fair value of these investments in the future.

Accounting for Derivatives and Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change  


On October 1, 2000, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 133, 
Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities
. SFAS No. 133 established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, hedging activities, and exposure definition. Net of the
related income tax effect of approximately $5 million, adoption of SFAS No. 133 resulted in a favorable cumulative-effect-type adjustment to net income of approximately
$12 million for the first quarter of 2001. The $17 million gross transition adjustment was comprised of a $23 million favorable adjustment for the restatement to fair value of the
derivative component of the Company's investment in Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (Samsung), partially offset by the unfavorable adjustments to certain foreign currency and interest rate
derivatives. SFAS No. 133 also required the Company to adjust the carrying value of the derivative component of its investment in Samsung to earnings during the first quarter of 2001, the
before tax effect of which was an unrealized loss of approximately $13 million. 


Interest and Other Income, Net  


Net interest and other income was $112 million in fiscal 2002, compared to $217 million in fiscal 2001. This $105 million or 48% decrease is primarily the
result of declining investment yields on the Company's cash and short-term investments resulting from substantially lower market interest rates. The weighted average interest rate earned
by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments fell to 2.85% in 2002 compared to 5.38% in 2001. 


Net
interest and other income increased $14 million or 7% to $217 million during 2001. The increase was due in part to interest income from higher cash and invested balances in 2001,
partially offset by declining interest rates and investment yields, and a rebalancing of the aggregate investment portfolio to a higher proportion of lower risk and better credit investments. The
weighted average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments fell to 5.38% in 2001 compared to 6.12% in 2000. 


The
Company expects interest and other income, net to decline substantially in 2003 as declines in interest rates continue to impact earnings on the Company's investment portfolio. The Company's
expects this decline to be most pronounced in the second half of the fiscal year. The foregoing statements are forward-looking. Interest and other income, net could differ from expected levels because
of several factors, including certain of those set forth below in the subsection entitled "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition." Additionally, actual future interest and
other income, net may be significantly impacted by unforeseen changes in market interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and the fair value of the Company's short-term and
long-term investments. 


Provision for Income Taxes  


The Company's effective tax rate for 2002 was 25% compared to the higher statutory rate due primarily to the research and development credit and the reversal of valuation
allowances. As of September 28, 2002, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $369 million before being offset
against certain deferred tax liabilities for presentation on the Company's balance sheet. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated
as a result of certain tax planning strategies, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining net deferred tax assets. As of September 28, 2002, a valuation allowance of $30 million
was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax losses that may not be realized. The valuation allowance relates principally to the operating loss carryforwards acquired from NeXT
and other acquisitions, the utilization of which is subject to certain limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax
assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance. 


32






 


The
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed audits of the Company's federal income tax returns through 1997. Substantially all IRS audit issues for years through 1997 have been resolved.
Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. 


Recent Accounting Pronouncements  


In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 143, 
Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations
, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated
asset retirement costs. The standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or
normal use of the asset. SFAS No. 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate
of fair value can be made. The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. The
Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 143 for the first quarter of its fiscal 2003. Management does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 143 to have a material impact on
the Company's financial statements. 


In
August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 144, 
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets
 (Statement 144), which supersedes both SFAS No. 121, 
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of
 and the
accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30 (Opinion 30), 
Reporting the Results of OperationsReporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of
a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions
, for the disposal of a segment of a business (as previously defined in that Opinion).
SFAS No. 144 retains the fundamental provisions in SFAS No. 121 for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long-lived assets held for use and long-lived
assets to be disposed of by sale, while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with SFAS No. 121. For example, SFAS No. 144 provides guidance on how a
long-lived asset that is used as part of a group should be evaluated for impairment, establishes criteria for when a long-lived asset is held for sale, and prescribes the
accounting for a long-lived asset that will be disposed of other than by sale. SFAS No. 144 retains the basic provisions of Opinion 30 on how to present discontinued operations in
the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity (rather than a segment of a business). Unlike SFAS No. 121, an impairment assessment under SFAS
No. 144 will never result in a write-down of goodwill. Rather, goodwill is evaluated for impairment under SFAS No. No. 142, 
Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets.


The
Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 144 for the first quarter of its fiscal 2003. Management does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 144 for
long-lived assets held for use to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements because the impairment assessment under SFAS No. 144 is largely unchanged from SFAS
No. 121. The provisions of SFAS No. 144 for assets held for sale or other disposal generally are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated disposal
activities. 


In
June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 146, 
Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities
. SFAS No. 146 supersedes Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94-3, 
Liability Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Costs To Exit an Activity (Including Certain Costs Associated with a Restructuring)
 and requires that a liability for a cost associated with an
exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred, as opposed to when management is committed to an exit plan. SFAS No. 146 also establishes that the liability should
initially be measured and recorded at fair value. This Statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The provisions of SFAS No. 146 are
required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated exit activities, and may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs, as well as the amounts recognized.

As
of September 28, 2002, the Company had $4.337 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, virtually unchanged from the end of fiscal 2001. The primary
sources of total cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments in fiscal 2002 were $89 million in cash generated by operating activities and $105 million in proceeds
from the exercise of employee stock options, offset by cash utilized for business and asset acquisitions of $52 million and capital expenditures of $174 million. 


The
Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital expenditures, stock
repurchase activity, outstanding commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. 


Lease Commitments  


As of September 28, 2002, the Company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases of $464 million, $209 million of which related to
the lease of retail space and related facilities. Remaining terms on the Company's existing operating leases range from 1 to 12 years. Subsequent to September 28, 2002, the Company
entered into additional operating lease commitments for retail space with future lease commitments totaling $65 million for periods ranging from 5 to 10 years. 


Long-Term Debt  


The Company currently has long-term debt outstanding in the form of $300 million of aggregate principal amount 6.5% unsecured notes. The notes were sold at
99.925% of par, for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. The notes pay interest semiannually and mature on February 15, 2004. 


Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Component Suppliers  


The Company utilizes several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company's products and to perform final assembly and test of finished
products. These contract manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods ranging from 1 to 3 months. The Company
also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of formal
purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such formal and informal purchase commitments typically cover the Company's forecasted component and
manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 130 days. As of September 28, 2002, the Company had outstanding third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase
commitments of approximately $525 million. 


34






 


Capital Expenditures  


Of total capital expenditures in 2002 of $174 million, $106 million was for retail store facilities and equipment related to the Company's Retail segment and
$68 million was for corporate infrastructure including information systems enhancements and operating facilities enhancements and expansions. The Company currently anticipates it will utilize
approximately $160 million for capital expenditures during 2003, approximately $77 million of which is expected to be utilized for further expansion of the Company's Retail segment and
the remainder utilized to support normal replacement of existing capital assets and enhancements to general information technology infrastructure. 


Stock Repurchase Plan  


In July 1999, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does
not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time. During 2002 and 2001, the Company repurchased no common shares. However, during
the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company entered into a forward purchase agreement to acquire 1.5 million shares of its common stock in September of 2003 at an average price of $16.64 per share
for a total cost of $25.5 million. Since inception of the repurchase plan, the Company has repurchased or committed to repurchase a total of 6.55 million shares of its common stock at a
cost of $217 million. 


Non-Current Debt and Equity Investments  


The Company has held significant investments in ARM, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd, Akamai, and EarthLink. These investments are reflected in the consolidated balance
sheets as non-current debt and equity investments and have been categorized as available-for-sale requiring that they be carried at fair value with unrealized gains
and losses, net of taxes, reported in equity as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income. All realized gains on the sale of these investments have been included in other income. The combined fair value of these investments was $39 million,
$128 million, and $786 million as of the end of fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The Company believes it is likely there will continue to be significant fluctuations in the
fair value of these investments in the future. 


Further
information related to the Company's non-current debt and equity investments may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Note 2 of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements. 


Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition  


Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company's operating results and financial condition, past financial performance should not be
considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. 


General economic conditions and current economic and political uncertainty could adversely affect the Company.  


The Company's operating performance depends significantly on general economic conditions. For much of the past 3 years, demand for the Company's products has been
negatively impacted by worsening global economic conditions. Continued uncertainty about future economic conditions continues to make it difficult to forecast future operating results. Should global
and regional economic conditions fail to improve or continue to deteriorate, demand for the Company's products could continue to be adversely affected, as could the financial health of its suppliers,
distributors, and resellers. 


The
terrorist attacks that took place on September 11, 2001, disrupted commerce throughout the world and created many economic and political uncertainties that have had a strong negative impact
on the global economy. The long-term effects of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the Company's future operating results and financial condition remain unknown. The national and
international responses to terrorist attacks, the potential for future terrorist attacks and other acts of hostility, and the potential for 


35






 





war in the Middle East have created economic and political uncertainties that could adversely affect the Company's future operating results and financial condition. 


The market for personal computers is highly competitive.  


The personal computer industry is highly competitive and is characterized by aggressive pricing practices, downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new
products, short product
life cycles, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, price sensitivity on the part of consumers, and a large number of competitors. Over the past several years, price
competition in the market for personal computers has been particularly intense. The Company's competitors who sell Windows-based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered their
product margins in order to gain or maintain market share in response to weakness in demand for personal computing products that began in the second half of calendar 2000. The Company's results of
operations and financial condition have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing pressures and downward pressures on gross margins. 


The
personal computer industry has also been characterized by rapid technological advances in software functionality, hardware performance, and features based on existing or emerging industry
standards. Further, as the personal computer industry and its customers place more reliance on the Internet, an increasing number of Internet devices that are smaller and simpler than traditional
personal computers may compete for market share with the Company's existing products. Several competitors of the Company have either targeted or announced their intention to target certain of the
Company's key market segments, including consumer, education, professional and consumer digital video editing, and design and publishing. Additionally, several of the Company's competitors have
introduced or announced plans to introduce products that mimic many of the unique design, technical features, and solutions of the Company's products. The Company has many substantial competitors,
many of whom have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, and technological resources, as well as broader product lines and larger installed customer bases than those of the Company.
Additionally, there has been a trend towards consolidation in the personal computer industry that has resulted in larger and potentially stronger competitors in the Company's markets. 


The
Company is currently the only maker of hardware using the Mac OS. The Mac OS has a minority market share in the personal computer market, which is dominated by makers of computers utilizing
Microsoft's Windows operating systems. The Company's future operating results and financial condition are substantially dependent on its ability to continue to develop improvements to the Macintosh
platform in order to maintain perceived design and functional advantages over competing platforms, including Windows. 


The Company has higher research and development and selling, general and administrative costs, as a percentage of revenues, than many of competitors.  


The Company's ability to compete successfully and maintain attractive gross margins is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow of innovative
and competitive products and technology to the marketplace. As a result, the Company incurs higher research and development costs as a percentage of revenue than its competitors who sell Windows-based
personal computers. Many of these competitors seek to compete aggressively on price and maintain very low cost structures. Further, as a result of the expansion of the Company's Retail segment and
costs associated with marketing the Company's brand including its unique operating system, the Company incurs higher selling costs as a percent of revenue than many of its competitors. If the Company
is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive gross margins, its results of operations may be materially adversely affected by its operating cost structure. 


36






 


The Company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions.  


Due to the highly volatile nature of the personal computer industry, which is characterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid technological advances, the Company
must continually introduce new products and technologies and enhance existing products in order to remain competitive. The success of new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors,
including market acceptance, the Company's ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions, the availability of application software for new products, the effective management of
inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other
defects in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect that new products will have on its sales or results of operations. 


During
2001, the Company introduced a new client operating system, Mac OS X, and delivered its first major upgrade, Mac OS X version 10.1. During 2002, the Company delivered another major upgrade, Mac
OS X Jaguar. Inability of the Company to improve the performance and functionality of Mac OS X, advance customer acceptance of the new operating system and its upgrades, or obtain the continued
commitment of software developers to transition existing applications to run on Mac OS X or create new applications to run on Mac OS X, may have an adverse impact on the Company's operating results
and financial condition. 


Because orders for components, and in some cases commitments to purchase components, must be placed in advance of customer orders, the Company faces substantial inventory risk.  


The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and products that have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value
and accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees of orders for inventories that have been canceled. Although the Company believes its inventory and related provisions are adequate, given the rapid
and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the computer industry, no assurance can be given the Company will not incur additional inventory and related charges. In addition, such charges have
had, and may again have, a material effect on the Company's financial position and results of operations. 


The
Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. Because the Company's markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes,
there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products. Consistent with industry practice, components
are normally acquired through a combination of formal purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such formal and informal purchase commitments
typically cover the Company's forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 130 days. The Company's operating results and financial condition have been in
the past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the Company's ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns. 


Future operating results are dependent upon the Company's ability to obtain a sufficient supply of components, some of which are in short supply or available only from limited
sources.  


Although most components essential to the Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components including microprocessors and application
specific integrated circuits ("ASICs") are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some key components (including without limitation DRAM, TFT-LCD
flat-panel displays, and optical and magnetic disk drives), while currently available to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide availability
and pricing pressures. In addition, new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a
need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. In situations where a component or product utilizes new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until such time as the
suppliers' yields have 


37






 



matured. The Company and other producers in the personal computer industry also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. The
Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry including certain microprocessors and ASICs. Continued availability of these components may be affected
if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of components other than those customized to meet the Company's requirements. If the supply of a key component were to be delayed or
constrained on a new or existing product, the Company's results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 


The
Company's ability to produce and market competitive products is also dependent on the ability and desire of IBM and Motorola, the sole suppliers of the PowerPC RISC-based
microprocessor for the Company's Macintosh computers, to provide the Company with a sufficient supply of microprocessors with price/performance features that compare favorably to those supplied to the
Company's competitors by Intel Corporation and other developers and producers of microprocessors used by personal computers using the Windows operating systems. Further, despite its efforts to educate
the marketplace to the contrary, the Company believes that many of its current and potential customers believe that the relatively slower MHz rating or clock speed of the microprocessors it utilizes
in its Macintosh systems compares unfavorably to those utilized by Windows-based systems and translates to slower overall system performance. There have been instances in recent years where the
inability of the Company's suppliers to provide advanced G4 and G3 microprocessors with higher clock speeds in sufficient quantity has had significant adverse effects on the Company's results of
operations. The inability in the future of the Company to obtain microprocessors in sufficient quantities with competitive price/performance features could have an adverse impact on the Company's
results of operations and financial condition. 


The Company is dependent on manufacturing and logistics services provided by third parties, many of whom are located outside of the United States.  


Many of the Company's products are manufactured in whole or in part by third-party manufacturers. In addition, the Company has outsourced much of its transportation and
logistics management. While outsourcing arrangements may lower the fixed cost of operations, they also reduce the Company's
direct control over production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of the products manufactured, or the flexibility of the
Company to respond to changing market conditions. Moreover, although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain at least
initially responsible to the ultimate consumer for warranty service or in the event of product defects. Any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with
contract manufacturers or otherwise, could adversely affect the Company's future operating results and financial condition. 


Final
assembly of products sold by the Company is conducted in the Company's manufacturing facilities in Sacramento, California, and Cork, Ireland, and by external vendors in Fullerton, California,
Taiwan, Korea, the People's Republic of China, and the Czech Republic. Currently, manufacture of many of the components used in the Company's products and final assembly of all of the Company's
portable products including PowerBooks, iBooks, and the iPod is performed by third-party vendors in Taiwan. If for any reason manufacturing or logistics in any of these locations is disrupted by
regional economic, business, environmental, political, or military conditions or events, the Company's results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 


The Company's products could experience quality problems that result in decreased net sales and operating profits.  


The Company sells highly complex hardware and software products that may contain defects in design and manufacture. Sophisticated operating system software and applications
such as the Company sells often contains "bugs" that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software. Defects may also occur in components and products the Company purchases from third
parties that may be beyond its control. 


38






 



There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware and software it sells. Failure to do so could result in lost revenues, loss of reputation, and
significant expense to remedy. 


The Company's retail initiative requires a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.  


Since May of 2001, the Company has opened 51 retail stores in the United States and anticipates opening more stores in calendar 2003. The Company's retail initiative has
required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory, and personnel. The Company has also entered into substantial operating leases commitments for
retail space with lease terms ranging from 5 to 12 years. The Company would incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate this initiative or close individual stores. Such costs could
adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a relatively high proportion of the Retail segment's costs are fixed because of depreciation on store
constructions costs and lease expense. As a result, should the Retail segment experience a decline in sales for any reason, significant losses would result. 


Certain
of the Company's stores have been intentionally designed and built to serve as high profile venues that function as vehicles for general corporate marketing, corporate events, and brand
awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment in equipment and leasehold improvements than the Company's typical retail
stores. The Company has opened two such stores and has several others under development. Because of their location and size, these high profile stores also require the Company to enter into
substantially larger operating lease commitments compared to those required for its more typical stores. Current leases on such locations have terms ranging from 5 to 10 years with total
commitments per location over the lease terms ranging from $25 million to $50 million. Closure or poor performance of one of these high profile stores could have a particularly
significant negative impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. 


Many
of the general risks and uncertainties the Company faces could also have an adverse impact on its Retail segment. Also, many factors unique to retail operations present risks and uncertainties,
some of which are beyond the Company's control, that could adversely affect the Retail segment's future results, cause its actual results to differ from those currently expected, and/or have an
adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations. Potential risks and uncertainties unique to retail operations that could have an adverse impact on the Retail segment include, among
other things, macro-economic factors that have a negative impact on general retail activity; inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation; lack of consumer acceptance of
the Company's retail approach; failure to attract new users to the Macintosh platform; inability to sell third-party hardware and software products at adequate margins; failure to manage relationships
with existing retail channel partners; lack of experience in managing retail operations; costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of Apple-branded and third-party retail
inventory; and inability to obtain quality retail locations at reasonable cost. 


Unit sales of the Company's professionally oriented desktop systems have declined sharply over past two to three years negatively impacting net sales and gross margin.  


Unit sales of Power Macintosh systems fell 18% during 2002 as compared to 2001 and fell 35% in 2001 from 2000. Power Macintosh unit sales have fallen as a percentage of total
Macintosh unit sales from 38% in 1999 to 25% in 2002. The Company believes that weak economic conditions over the past several years are having a pronounced negative impact on its professional and
creative customers who are the primary users of such systems. The Company also believes that many of these customers continue to delay upgrades of their Power Macintosh systems due to the Company's
ongoing transition to Mac OS X and in anticipation of certain software vendors transitioning their professionally oriented Macintosh software applications to run natively in Mac OS X. In addition to
the negative impact on net sales, declining sales of Power Macintosh systems also have a negative effect on the Company's overall gross margin because Power Macintosh systems are generally higher
priced and have higher individual gross margins than the 


39






 



Company's other Macintosh systems. Continued deterioration in Power Macintosh unit sales will adversely affect the Company's future net sales and gross margin. If future unit sales of Power Macintosh
systems fail to partially or fully recover, it will be difficult for the Company to improve its overall profitability. 


The Company faces increasing competition in the U.S. education market.  


Sales in the United States to both elementary and secondary schools, as well as for college and university customers, remains a core market for Apple. Net sales in these
markets fell to 21% of the Company's total net sales in 2002 from 26% in 2001. This drop reflects declines in both net sales and Macintosh unit sales in these markets of 15% and 14%, respectively, in
fiscal 2002 compared to 2001. These developments are consistent with industry data showing the Company losing market share in the U.S. education market in each of the last two fiscal years. Several
competitors of the Company have either targeted or announced their intention to target the education market for personal computers. Although the Company has taken certain steps to strengthen its
position in the education market, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to increase its share of the education market or maintain its existing share of that market. Failure to
increase or maintain market share in the education market may have an adverse impact on the Company's operating results and financial condition. 


The Company's future operating performance is dependent on the performance of distributors and other resellers of the Company's products.  


The Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers and cataloguers, many of whom distribute products from competing
manufacturers. In addition, the Company also sells many of its products and resells certain third-party products in most of its major markets directly to end users, certain education customers, and
certain resellers through its online stores around the world. The Company also sells its own products and certain third-party products through its retail stores in the United States. Many of the
Company's significant resellers operate on narrow product margins and have been negatively affected by current economic conditions. Considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or
credit insurance are outstanding with the Company's distribution and retail channel partners. The Company's business and financial results could be adversely affected if the financial condition of
these resellers weakened, if resellers within consumer channels were to cease distribution of the Company's products, or if uncertainty regarding demand for the Company's products caused resellers to
reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company's products. 


Further
information regarding risks associated with Marketing and Distribution may be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading "Markets and Distribution,"
which information is hereby incorporated by reference. 


The Company's business is subject to the risks of international operations.  


A large portion of the Company's revenue is derived from its international operations. As a result, the Company's operating results and financial condition could be
significantly affected by risks associated with international activities, including economic and labor conditions, political instability, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), and
changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the local currency in which the products are sold and goods and services are purchased. Historically, the Company's primary exposure to movements in
foreign currency exchange rates relate to non-dollar denominated sales in
Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada, and certain parts of Asia and non-dollar denominated operating expenses incurred throughout the world. Weaknesses in foreign currencies, particularly the
Japanese Yen and the Euro, can adversely impact consumer demand for the Company's products and the U.S. dollar value of the Company's foreign currency denominated sales. Conversely, strengthening in
these and other foreign currencies can increase the cost to the Company of product components, negatively affecting the Company's results of operations.

Margins
on sales of Apple products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties. 


Further
information related to the Company's global market risks may be found in Part II, Item 7A of this Form 10-K under the subheading "Foreign Currency Risk" and may be
found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Notes 1 and 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which information is hereby incorporated by reference. 


The Company's future performance is dependent upon support from third-party software developers.  


The Company believes that decisions by customers to purchase the Company's personal computers, as opposed to Windows-based systems, are often based on the availability of
third-party software for particular applications such as Microsoft Office. The Company also believes the availability of third-party application software for the Company's hardware products depends in
part on third-party developers' perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the Company's products versus software for the larger
Windows market. This analysis is based on factors such as the perceived strength of the Company and its products, the anticipated potential revenue that may be generated, acceptance by customers of
Mac OS X, and the costs of developing such software products. To the extent the Company's financial losses in prior years and the minority market share held by the Company in the personal computer
market, as well as the Company's decision to end its Mac OS licensing program, have caused software developers to question the Company's prospects in the personal computer market, developers could be
less inclined to develop new application software or upgrade existing software for the Company's products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the
larger Windows market. In addition, past and future development by the Company of its own software applications and solutions may negatively impact the decision of software developers to develop,
maintain, and upgrade similar or competitive software for the Company's products. Moreover, there can be no assurance software developers will continue to develop software for Mac OS X, the Company's
new operating system, on a timely basis or at all. 


In
August 1997, the Company and Microsoft Corporation entered into patent cross license and technology agreements. In addition, for a period of five years through August 2002, and
subject to certain limitations related to the number of Macintosh computers sold by the Company, Microsoft was
required to make versions of its Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer products for the Mac OS. Although Microsoft has released Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer for Mac OS X, Microsoft is not
obligated to produce future versions of its products subsequent to August 2002. While the Company believes its relationship with Microsoft has been and will continue to be beneficial to the
Company and to its efforts to increase the installed base for the Mac OS, the Company does compete directly with Microsoft in a number of key areas. Accordingly, Microsoft's interest in producing
application software for the Mac OS following expiration of the agreements may be influenced by Microsoft's perception of its interests as the vendor of the Windows operating system. Discontinuance of
Microsoft Office and other Microsoft products for the Macintosh platform would have an adverse effect on the Company's net sales and results of operations. 


The Company's business relies on access to patents and intellectual property obtained from third parties, and the Company's future results could be adversely affected if it is
alleged or found to have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others.  


Many of the Company's products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses
relating to various aspects of its products and business methods, the Company believes that based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially
reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available or available on acceptable terms. 


41






 


Because
of technological changes in the computer industry, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible certain components of the Company's products
and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents of others. The Company has from time to time been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property
rights of others. Responding to such claims, regardless of their merit, can be time consuming, result in significant expenses, and cause the diversion of management and technical personnel. Several
pending claims are in various stages of evaluation. The Company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements in certain of these cases. However, no assurance can be given that
such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. In the event there is a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting the Company from marketing or selling
certain of its products or a successful claim of infringement against the Company requiring it to pay royalties to a third-party, the Company's future operating results and financial condition could
be adversely effected. Information regarding claims and potential litigation involving the Company related to alleged patent infringement and other matters is set forth in Part I, Item 3 of
this Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability for damages or royalties from any current legal proceedings or claims related to the
infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others that would have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, or financial condition. However, the results of such
legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others
described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K or should several of these matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a
particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. 


The Company expects its quarterly revenues and operating results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons.  


The Company's profit margins vary among its products, its geographic markets, and its distribution channels. As a result, the overall profitability of the Company in any given
period will depend, in part, on the product, geographic, and channel mix reflected in that period's net sales. 


The typical concentration of net sales in the third month of the Company's fiscal quarters can adversely affect the Company's business and operating results.  


The Company generally sells more products during the third month of each quarter than it does during either of the first two months, a pattern typical in the personal computer
industry. This sales pattern can produce pressure on the Company's internal infrastructure during the third month of a quarter and may adversely impact the Company's ability to predict its financial
results accurately. Developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company's products, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the
Company's key logistics or components suppliers, can have significant adverse impacts on the Company and its results of operations and financial condition. 


The Company's success depends largely on its ability to attract and retain key personnel.  


Much of the future success of the Company depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel, including those in technical, marketing and staff positions.
Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley, where the majority of the Company's
employees are located. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully attract and retain the key personnel it needs. Additionally, volatility or a lack of positive performance
in the Company's stock price may adversely affect its ability to retain key employees. As of September 28, 2002, a substantial majority of the Company's outstanding employee stock options were
out-of-the-money. 


The Company is subject to risks associated with the availability and cost of insurance.  


The Company has observed rapidly changing conditions in the insurance markets relating to nearly all areas of traditional corporate insurance. Such conditions have resulted in
higher premium costs, higher policy deductibles, and lower coverage limits. For some risks, because of cost and/or availability, the 


42






 



Company does not have insurance coverage. For these reasons, the Company is retaining a greater portion of its insurable risks than it has in the past at relatively greater cost. 


The Company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivables. This risk is heightened as economic conditions worsen.  


The Company distributes its products through third-party computer resellers and retailers and directly to certain educational institutions and commercial customers. A
substantial majority of the Company's outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. The Company also has non-trade receivables from certain of its
manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale by the Company of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the
Company. While the Company has procedures in place to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and non-trade receivables, there can be assurance that such procedures will be
effective in limiting its credit risk and avoiding losses. Additionally, if the global economy and regional economies fail to improve or continue to deteriorate, it becomes more likely that the
Company will incur a material loss or losses as a result of the weakening financial condition of one or more of its customers or manufacturing vendors. 


The market value of the Company's non-current debt and equity investments is subject to significant volatility.  


The Company holds minority investments in several public companies with a combined fair market value of approximately $39 million as of September 28, 2002. These
investments are in publicly traded companies whose share prices are subject to significant volatility. The Company has categorized its investments in these companies as
available-for-sale requiring the investments be carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income. The Company recognizes an impairment charge to earnings when it is judged an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other-than-temporary.
The Company has recognized material impairment charges related to its non-current debt and equity investments twice in the last two fiscal years. 


The Company is subject to risks associated with environmental regulations.  


Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the
requirement that the Company provide consumers with the ability to return to the Company product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling
with the Company. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such
existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Company. 


The
parliament of the European Union is working on finalizing the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (the Directive). The Directive makes producers of electrical goods, including
personal computers, financially responsible for the collection, recycling, and safe disposal of past and future products. The Directive must now be approved and implemented by individual European
Union governments by June 2004, while the producers' financial obligations are scheduled to start June 2005. The Company's potential liability resulting from the Directive related to
past sales of its products and expenses associated with future sales of its product may be substantial. However, because it is likely that specific
laws, regulations, and enforcement policies will vary significantly between individual European member states, it is not currently possible to estimate the Company's existing liability or future
expenses resulting from the Directive. As the European Union and its individual member states clarify specific requirements and policies with respect to the Directive, the Company will continue to
assess its potential financial impact. Similar legislation may be enacted in other geographies, including federal and state legislation in the United States, the cumulative impact of which could be
significant. 


43






 




Business interruptions could adversely affect the Company's future operating results.  


The Company's major business operations are subject to interruption by earthquake, fire, power shortages, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, and other
events beyond its control. The majority of the Company's research and development activities, its corporate headquarters, and other critical business operations, including certain major components
suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are located near major seismic faults. The Company does not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses. The Company's operating results and
financial condition could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster. 


Unanticipated changes in the Company's tax rates could affect its future results.  


The Company's future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax
rates, changes in the valuation of the Company deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation. 


The Company's stock price may be volatile.  


The Company's stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between its actual and anticipated financial results and as a result of
announcements by the Company and its competitors. In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies
in ways that have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These factors, as well as general economic and political conditions and investors' concerns regarding the credibility
of corporate financial reporting and integrity of financial markets, may materially adversely affect the market price of the Company's common stock in the future.

Item 7A. Disclosures About Market Risk    
 


Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management  


To ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's foreign exchange and interest rate hedge positions, as well as to monitor the risks and opportunities of the
non-hedge portfolios, the Company continually monitors its foreign exchange forward and option positions, and its interest rate swap and option positions both on a stand-alone basis and in
conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures, respectively, from both an accounting and an economic perspective. However, given the effective horizons of the
Company's risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures intended to hedge, there can be no assurance the aforementioned programs will offset more than a portion of the
adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to
mark-to-market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely
affect the Company's operating results and financial position. The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 133, 
Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities
, as of October 1, 2000. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, hedging
activities, and exposure definition. Management does not believe that ongoing application of SFAS No. 133 will significantly alter the Company's hedging strategies. However, its application may
increase the volatility of other income and expense and other comprehensive income. 


Interest Rate Risk  


While the Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world's leading industrialized countries, the Company's interest income and expense is most sensitive
to fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. In this regard, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and
short-term investments as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges. 


The
Company's fixed income investment policy and strategy is to ensure the preservation of capital, meet liquidity requirements, and optimize return in light of the current credit and interest rate
environment. The Company benchmarks its performance by utilizing external money managers to manage a small portion of the aggregate investment portfolio. The external managers adhere to the Company's
investment policies and also provide occasional research and market information that supplements internal research used to make credit decisions in the investment process. 


During
1994, the Company issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 6.5% unsecured notes in a public offering registered with the SEC. The notes were sold at 99.925% of par, for an
effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. The notes pay interest semiannually and mature on February 15, 2004. 


The
Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company's investment portfolio and long-term debt obligations and related derivative financial
instruments. The Company places its short-term investments in highly liquid securities issued by high credit quality issuers and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one
issuer. The Company's general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk. All highly liquid investments with maturities of
three months or less are classified as cash equivalents; highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as short-term investments. As of
September 28, 2002, $1.087 billion of the Company's investment portfolio classified as short-term investments was invested in U.S. Agency and corporate debt securities with
maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. As of September 29, 2001, $313 million of the Company's investment portfolio classified as short-term investments was in U.S.
agency securities with underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 4 years. The remainder all had underlying maturities between 3 and 12 months. Due to liquidity needs, or in anticipation of
credit deterioration, or for the purpose of duration management of the Company's 


45






 





investment portfolio, the Company may sell investments prior to their stated maturities. As a result of such activity, the Company recognized net gains of $7 million in 2002 and
$1 million in 2001. 


In
order to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company's investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that a
change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 28,
2002, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $37.7 million decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. As of
September 29, 2001, a similar 100 basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a $17.8 million decline in fair value. Such losses would only be realized if the Company
sold the investments prior to maturity. Except in instances noted above, the Company's policy is to hold investments to maturity. 


The
Company sometimes enters into interest rate derivative transactions, including interest rate swaps, collars, and floors, with financial institutions in order to better match the Company's
floating-rate interest income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on its long-term debt, and/or to
diversify a portion of the Company's exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. The Company may also enter into interest rate contracts that are intended to reduce
the cost of the interest rate risk management program. 


During
the last two years, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps with financial institutions in order to better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its cash
equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on its long-term debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the Company's exposure away from
fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. The interest rate swaps, which qualified as accounting hedges, generally required the Company to pay a floating interest rate based on the
three- or six-month U.S. dollar LIBOR and receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of the underlying notional amounts. These swaps effectively converted the Company's
fixed-rate 10-year debt to floating-rate debt and convert a portion of the floating rate investments to fixed rate. Due to prevailing market interest rates, during
2002 the Company entered into and then subsequently closed out debt swap positions realizing a gain of $6 million. During 2001
the Company closed out all of its then existing debt swap positions realizing a gain of $17 million. Both the gains in 2001 and 2002 were deferred, recognized in long-term debt and
are being amortized to other income and expense over the remaining life of the debt. At certain times in the past, the Company has also entered into interest rate contracts that are intended to reduce
the cost of the interest rate risk management program. The Company does not hold or transact in such financial instruments for purposes other than risk management. 


The
Company's asset swaps did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and were recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with associated gains and losses recorded in interest and other income.
Interest rate asset swaps outstanding as of September 30, 2000, had a weighted-average receive rate of 5.50% and a weighted-average pay rate of 6.66%. The unrealized loss on these assets swaps
as of September 30, 2000, of $5.7 million was deferred and then recognized in income in 2001 as part of the SFAS No. 133 transition adjustment effective on October 1, 2000.
The Company closed out all of its existing interest rate asset swaps during 2001 realizing a gain of $1.1 million. 


Foreign Currency Risk  


Overall, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar and, as such, benefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar
relative to major currencies worldwide. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may negatively affect the Company's net sales and gross margins as
expressed in U.S. dollars. There is also a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing within the time frame of our hedged positions due to competitive pressures when
there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. 


46






 


The
Company enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions primarily to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities,
certain firmly committed transactions, and probable but not firmly committed transactions. Generally, the Company's practice is to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange
transaction exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, and limited
availability of appropriate of hedging instruments. The Company also enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the
re-measurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies of its foreign subsidiaries. 


In
order to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company's foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis
using a value-at-risk (VAR) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate 3000
random market price paths. The value-at-risk is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company's foreign exchange portfolio due to
adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The model
assumes normal market conditions. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the
model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $3.8 million as of September 28, 2002 compared to a maximum one-day loss
of $6.8 million as of September 29, 2001. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, losses incurred on those instruments are generally offset by
increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures. 


Actual
gains and losses in the future associated with the Company's investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of
September 28, 2002 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and amount of interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates, and the Company's actual
exposures and positions.

Net Sales

Net sales increased $1,873 million, or 20%, in fiscal 1995, compared with
an  increase  of $1,212 million, or 15%, in fiscal 1994.  The  net  sales
growth  in  1995  over  1994 was primarily due to a combination  of  unit
growth,  higher average selling prices, and changes in currency  exchange
rates.  Total Macintosh computer unit sales increased approximately  15%
over  the  prior year.  This unit sales growth resulted principally  from
strong  sales of the Company's Power Macintosh products, which accounted
for over 70% of total unit shipments at the end of the fourth quarter  of
1995,  compared with 26% in the comparable period of 1994, and from sales
of  newer  product  offerings  within the  Performa  family  of  desktop
personal  computers.  This unit growth was partially offset by  declining
unit  sales  of  certain of the Company's older product  offerings.   The
average  aggregate  revenue  per Macintosh unit  increased  12%  in  1995
compared  with 1994, primarily due to a shift in product mix  toward  the
Company's newer products and products with multimedia configurations.

The  net sales growth in 1994 over 1993 was primarily due to two factors:
unit  sales  growth and, to a lesser extent, an increase in  the  average
aggregate revenue per Macintosh computer unit.  Total Macintosh  computer
unit  sales  increased  16% over the prior year.   This  growth  resulted
principally  from  strong  sales  of the Company's  new  Power  Macintosh
products  and  of  newer product offerings within the Macintosh  Performa
family of desktop personal computers and, to a lesser extent, from  sales
of  products within the PowerBook family of notebook personal computers.
This  growth was partially offset by declining unit sales in  certain  of
the  Company's more established products and older product versions.  The
average   aggregate  revenue  per  Macintosh  unit  increased   slightly,
primarily due to fluctuations in product mix throughout the year, despite
pricing  actions  undertaken by the Company  in  response  to  continuing
industrywide pricing pressures.

International net sales grew 25% from 1994 to 1995, primarily  reflecting
strong  net  sales growth in the Pacific region, particularly Japan,  and
favorable  changes in currency exchange rates.  Net sales grew moderately
in  Europe over the same period.  International net sales grew  17%  from
1993 to 1994, primarily reflecting strong net sales growth in the Pacific
region, particularly Japan.  International net sales represented  48%  of
net  sales in 1995 compared with 46% of net sales in 1994 and 45% of  net
sales in 1993.  Domestic net sales grew 16% over the prior year, compared
with  an  increase  of  14% in 1994 over 1993, primarily  resulting  from
strong growth in the education and consumer markets.

In general, the Company's resellers typically purchase products on an as-
needed  basis.  Resellers frequently change delivery schedules and  order
rates   depending   on  changing  market  conditions.   Unfilled   orders
("backlog")  can  be,  and  often are, canceled  at  will.   The  Company
attempts  to  fill orders on the requested delivery schedules.   However,
products  may  be  in  relatively short supply from time  to  time  until
production volumes have reached a level sufficient to meet demand  or  if
other production or fulfillment constraints exist.  The Company's backlog
was  approximately $618 million at December 1, 1995, consisting primarily
of the Company's higher-end Power Macintosh products.

                                       10



In  the Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any
particular  time  is not a meaningful indication of its  future  business
prospects.  In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of  or
immediately   following   introduction  of  new   products   because   of
overordering by dealers anticipating shortages.  Backlog often is reduced
once  dealers  and  customers believe they can obtain sufficient  supply.
Because  of  the  foregoing,  as  well as  other  factors  affecting  the
Company's  backlog, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator
of  the  Company's future revenue or financial performance.  For  further
information  regarding  the  Company's  backlog,  refer  to  page  13  of
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition  and  Results
of  Operations under the heading "Factors That May Affect Future  Results
and Financial Condition."

Gross Margin

Gross  margin represents the difference between the Company's  net  sales
and  its cost of goods sold.  The amount of revenue generated by the sale
of products is influenced principally by the price set by the Company for
its products relative to competitive products.  The cost of goods sold is
based primarily on the cost of components and, to a lesser extent, direct
labor  costs.   The  type and cost of components included  in  particular
configurations of the Company's products (such as memory and disk drives)
are   often   directly  related  to  the  need  to  market  products   in
configurations   competitive   with   those   of   other   manufacturers.
Competition  in  the personal computer industry is intense,  and  in  the
short  term,  frequent changes in pricing and product  configuration  are
often  necessary  in  order  to remain competitive.   Accordingly,  gross
margin  as  a percentage of net sales can be significantly influenced  in
the  short  term  by  actions undertaken by the Company  in  response  to
industrywide competitive pressures.

Gross margin increased both in amount and as a percentage of net sales in
1995 compared with 1994.  The increase in gross margin as a percentage of
net  sales  was primarily a result of a shift in product mix  toward  the
Company's  newer, high-margin products, which included  strong  sales  of
certain  products within the Company's Power Macintosh family of personal
computers and its entry-level Macintosh Performa family.

The increase in gross margin levels was affected favorably by changes  in
foreign  currency  exchange rates as a result of  a  weaker  U.S.  dollar
relative to certain foreign currencies  in 1995 compared with 1994.   The
Company's  operating strategy and pricing take into  account  changes  in
exchange  rates over time; however, the Company's results  of  operations
can  be  significantly  affected in the short  term  by  fluctuations  in
foreign currency exchange rates.

Gross  margin  in  1994 declined as a percentage of net sales  from  1993
levels.  The downward trend in gross margin as a percentage of net  sales
was  primarily a result of pricing and promotional actions undertaken  by
the  Company  in response to industrywide competitive pricing  pressures.
Gross  margin was also affected somewhat adversely by changes in  foreign
currency exchange rates as a result of a stronger U.S. dollar relative to
certain foreign currencies in 1994 compared with 1993.  Results from  the
Company's ongoing foreign currency hedging activities offset a portion of
this adverse foreign currency impact on gross margin.

Although  the Company's gross margin percentage was 25.8% in 1995,  gross
margin  as  a  percentage of net sales declined to 20.7%  in  the  fourth
quarter  of 1995, primarily due to aggressive pricing actions and product
mix  issues  related to component availability and delays in new  PowerPC
processor-based product production.  It is anticipated that gross margins
will  continue  to remain under significant pressure and  are  likely  to
remain  comparable to the level reported for the fourth quarter  of  1995
due  to  a  variety of factors, including continued industrywide  pricing
pressures,  increased competition, particularly in Japan, and  compressed
product life cycles.

Research and Development

Research  and  development expenditures increased in amount  during  1995
when  compared with 1994, primarily due to higher project- and headcount-
related  spending, as the Company continues to invest in the  development
of   new  products  and  technologies.   The  decrease  in  research  and
development  expenditures during 1994 compared with  1993  reflected  the
results  of the Company's restructuring actions aimed at reducing  costs,
including  product  development expenditures.  Research  and  development
expenditures  as  a  percentage of net sales have continued  to  decrease
since  1993  as a result of revenue growth during 1994 and 1995,  coupled
with  the  Company's  continuing  efforts  to  focus  its  research   and
development project spending in an efficient manner.

The  Company  believes that continued focused investment in research  and
development is critical to its future growth and competitive position  in
the marketplace, and is directly related to continued, timely development
of new and enhanced products.

Selling, General and Administrative

Selling,  general and administrative expenses increased  in  amount,  but
decreased as a percentage of net sales, in 1995 compared with 1994.  This
increase  in expense was primarily a result of increased advertising  and
channel  marketing program spending as the Company continued its  efforts
to  expand  its  market share.  Although the Company  has  increased  its
selling  and marketing expenses in an effort to expand its market  share,
there  can be no assurance that such an increase in spending will  result
in a corresponding

                                       11



increase  in  market share.  The decrease as a percentage  of  net  sales
since  1993 is primarily a result of revenue growth during 1994 and 1995,
combined  with  the Company's ongoing efforts to manage  total  operating
expense growth.

In 1994, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in amount
and as a percentage of net sales compared with 1993, primarily because of
lower   employee-related  and  facilities  costs   resulting   from   the
restructuring actions taken in the third quarter of 1993.  Revenue growth
in  1994  also  contributed  to  the decrease  in  selling,  general  and
administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales.

The  Company  will continue to face the challenge of managing  growth  in
selling,  general and administrative expenses relative  to  gross  margin
levels,  particularly in light of the Company's expectation of  continued
pressure on gross margins and continued competitive pressures worldwide.

Restructuring Costs

For  information regarding the Company's restructuring actions, refer  to
pages 29 - 30 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net

Interest  and  other income (expense), net, decreased to $10  million  in
expense  in  1995 from $22 million in expense in 1994.  This $12  million
favorable change is comprised of $48 million in interest and other income
attributable to higher average cash balances, higher interest rates,  and
interest  rate hedging gains, offset in part by a $36 million unfavorable
variance  related  to  realized and unrealized foreign  exchange  hedging
losses  and foreign exchange hedging costs.  Market volatility and higher
foreign currency balances account for the increased hedging cost.

In  1994,  interest  and other income (expense), net,  decreased  to  $22
million in expense from $30 million of income in 1993, resulting in a $52
million  unfavorable change.  Higher interest rates  and  larger  average
borrowing  balances  used  to  fund  working  capital  needs  served   to
significantly increase interest expense, and accounted for $28 million of
the  $52 million change during 1994.  Other factors contributing to  this
variance included interest income, which was higher in 1993 than in  1994
primarily  due  to  a  $15  million  interest  payment  received   on   a
nonrecurring income tax refund from the Internal Revenue Service in 1993,
and  interest  income  from the Company's interest rate  risk  management
program,  which  contributed  $6 million in 1993,  and  reduced  interest
income by $7 million in 1994.

For more information regarding the Company's strategy and accounting for
financial and other derivative instruments, refer to pages 26 -  28 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Provision for Income Taxes            1995   Change  1994   Change  1993

Effective tax rate                     37%            38%            38%

The Company's effective tax rate decreased to 37% in 1995 compared with a
rate  of  38%  in  1994  and 1993.  For additional information  regarding
income  taxes,  refer  to  pages 31 - 32 of  the  Notes  to  Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition

The  Company's  future  operating results  and  financial  condition  are
dependent  on the Company's ability to successfully develop, manufacture,
and  market technologically innovative products in order to meet  dynamic
customer  demand  patterns.  Inherent in this process  are  a  number  of
factors  that  the Company must successfully manage in order  to  achieve
favorable future operating results and financial condition.

Product Introductions and Transitions

Due  to  the  highly  volatile nature of the personal computer  industry,
which  is  characterized by dynamic customer demand  patterns  and  rapid
technological  advances, the Company frequently introduces  new  products
and  product  enhancements.  The success of new product introductions  is
dependent  on  a  number  of factors, including  market  acceptance,  the
Company's   ability   to  manage  the  risks  associated   with   product
transitions,  the availability of application software for new  products,
the  effective  management of inventory levels in line  with  anticipated
product   demand,  and  the  manufacturing  of  products  in  appropriate
quantities  to meet anticipated demand.  Accordingly, the Company  cannot
determine the ultimate effect that new products will have on its sales or
results of operations.

                                       12



In  1994, the Company introduced Power Macintosh, a new line of Macintosh
computers  based  on  a new PowerPC family of RISC microprocessors.   The
Company's  results of operations and financial condition may be adversely
affected if it is unable to successfully complete the transition  of  its
lines of personal computers and servers from the Motorola 68000 series of
microprocessors  to  the PowerPC microprocessor.  The  success  of  this
ongoing  transition will depend on the Company's ability to  continue  to
sell products based on the Motorola 68000 series of microprocessors while
continuing  to  gain market acceptance of the new PowerPC processor-based
products,  to successfully manage inventory levels of both product  lines
simultaneously, and to continue to coordinate the timely development  and
distribution  by  independent software vendors of new  "native"  software
applications   specifically  designed  for  the  PowerPC  processor-based
products.

The rate of product shipments immediately following introduction of a new
product  is not necessarily an indication of the future rate of shipments
for  that product, which depends on many factors, some of which  are  not
under  the  control  of the Company.  These factors may  include  initial
large  purchases by a small segment of the user population that tends  to
purchase new technology prior to its acceptance by the majority of  users
("early adopters"); purchases in satisfaction of pent-up demand by  users
who  anticipated  new  technology and as a result deferred  purchases  of
other products; and overordering by dealers who anticipate shortages  due
to the aforementioned factors.  The preceding may also be offset by other
factors,  such  as  the  deferral of purchases by many  users  until  new
technology  is accepted as "proven" and for which commonly used  software
products are available; and the reduction of orders by dealers once  they
believe  they  can  obtain  sufficient supply of  product  previously  in
backlog.

Backlog  is  often volatile after new product introductions  due  to  the
aforementioned   demand   factors,  often  increasing   coincident   with
introduction, and then decreasing once dealers and customers believe they
can obtain sufficient supply of product.

The  measurement  of  demand  for newly introduced  products  is  further
complicated  by  the  availability of different  product  configurations,
which  may  include various types of built-in peripherals  and  software.
Configurations may also require certain localization (such  as  language)
for  various  markets  and, as a result, demand in  different  geographic
areas  may  be a function of the availability of third-party software  in
those  localized  versions.  For example, the availability  of  European-
language versions of software products manufactured by U.S. producers may
lag  behind the availability of U.S. versions by a quarter or more.  This
may result in lower initial demand for the Company's new products outside
the  United  States,  even  though localized versions  of  the  Company's
products may be available.

Competition

The personal computer industry is highly competitive and continues to  be
characterized by consolidations in the hardware and software  industries,
aggressive  pricing practices, and downward pressure  on  gross  margins.
For  example,  in  Japan, other companies have begun to initiate  extreme
competitive  actions in order to gain market share, and as a result,  the
Company  has  implemented incremental pricing and promotional activities.
The  Company's  results of operations and financial  condition  could  be
adversely affected should the Company be unable to effectively manage the
impact of industrywide pricing pressures and downward pressures on  gross
margins.

The  Company's future operating results and financial condition may  also
be  affected  by  the  Company's ability to offer  customers  competitive
technologies  while effectively managing the impact on  inventory  levels
and   the   potential   for  customer  confusion   created   by   product
proliferation.   The  Company's future operating  results  and  financial
condition  may also be affected by overall demand for personal  computers
and general customer preferences for one platform over another or one set
of product features over another.

On  November 7, 1994, the Company reached an agreement with IBM and 
Motorola, Inc. on a new hardware reference  platform for the PowerPC 
microprocessor that  is  intended  to deliver  a  much wider range of 
operating system and application  choices for  computer customers.  As a 
result of this agreement, the  Company  is moving  forward  with its efforts 
to make the Macintosh operating  system available on the common platform.  
In line with its efforts, on  November 13, 1995, the Company, IBM, and 
Motorola, Inc. announced the availability of  the "PowerPC Platform," which 
is a set of specifications that defines a  "unified"  personal  computer  
architecture  and  combines  the  Power Macintosh  platform and the PC 
environment.  Accordingly,  the  Company's future  operating results and 
financial condition may be affected by  its ability  to  continue  to  
implement this  agreement  and  certain  other collaboration agreements, 
and to manage the associated competitive risk.

The  Company  is currently the primary maker of hardware  that  uses  the
Macintosh  operating system, and it has a minority market  share  in  the
personal computer market, which is dominated by makers of computers  that
run  the MS-DOS (registered trademark) and Microsoft Windows (trademark) 
operating systems.  The Company's future  operating results and financial 
condition may be affected by  its ability  to increase market share in its 
personal computer business.   As part  of  its  efforts  to  increase 
overall market  share,  the  Company announced  the  licensing  of the 
Macintosh  operating  system  to  other personal  computer vendors in 
January 1995, and several vendors currently sell product that utilize the 
Macintosh operating system.  The success of the  Company's  efforts  to  
increase its overall  market  share  through licensing  of the Macintosh 
operating system will depend in part  on  the Company's  ability  to manage 
the risks associated  with  competing  with companies producing Macintosh 
OS-based computer systems.  Accordingly,  the  Company  cannot determine

                                       13



the  ultimate  effect  that licensing  of  the Macintosh operating system 
will have  on  its  product pricing  and  unit  sales  or  future  operating 
results  and  financial condition.  The Company believes that licensing the 
operating system will result  in a broader installed base on which software 
vendors can develop and  provide technical innovations for the Macintosh 
platform.   However, there  can  be no assurance that the installed base 
will be broadened  by the licensing of the operating system or that licensing
will result in an increase  in  the number of application software titles or 
the  rate  at which  vendors  will bring to market application software  
based  on  the Macintosh operating system.

The   Company's  principal  competitor  in  producing  operating   system
software,  Microsoft  Corporation, is a large, well-financed  corporation
which  has  a  dominant  position in various  segments  of  the  personal
computer  software  industry.   In  August  1995,  Microsoft  Corporation
released  Windows 95, another of its operating system  offerings.   As  a
result of the introduction of Windows 95, the Company has taken and  will
continue  to  take  steps  to address the additional  challenges  to  and
competitive  pressures  on its efforts in developing  and  marketing  the
Company's products.  Accordingly, the Company's future operating  results
and financial condition could be adversely affected should the Company be
unable   to  effectively  manage  the  competitive  pressure  and   other
challenges presented by the introduction of Windows 95.

Certain  of  the  Company's personal computer  products  are  capable  of
running application software designed for the MS-DOS or Windows operating
systems ("Cross-Platform Products"), through software emulation of  Intel
Corporation microprocessor chips by use of software specifically designed
for  the  Company's  products, either those based on the  Motorola  68000
series  of  microprocessors or those based on the PowerPC microprocessor.
The  Company  has also introduced products that include both  the  RISC-
based  PowerPC 601 microprocessor and the 486 DX2/66 microprocessor, which
enable  users  to  switch between the Macintosh and DOS or Windows  computing
environments.

The  Company  currently  supplies customers who  purchase  Cross-Platform
Products  capable of running the MS-DOS or Windows 3.1 operating system with
operating  system  software under a licensing agreement  with  Microsoft.
This  license  agreement expires on December 31, 1995 (the  "Old  License
Agreement").   The Company has attempted to license Windows  95  software
from  Microsoft  but has been unable to do so because  of  the  Company's
unwillingness to consent to Microsoft's demand under Microsoft's proposed
license  agreement (the "New License Agreement") that the  Company  agree
not to sue Microsoft if Microsoft infringes any of the Company's patents.
Microsoft  has also informed the Company that it will not renew  the  Old
License  Agreement unless the Company accepts the New License  Agreement.
Accordingly,  unless an appropriate licensing agreement is reached,  upon
the  expiration of the Old License Agreement, the Company will be  unable
to  supply customers with any of Microsoft's operating systems on  Cross-
Platform  Products.   Although  customers could  obtain  copies  of  such
software from other sources, the Company is unable to predict the  effect
of  such a situation on the demand for Cross-Platform Products.  Although
Cross-Platform Products represented only a small portion of the Company's
unit  sales during 1995, the Company is unable to predict the  effect  of
such a situation on the Company's future operating results.

Decisions  by customers to purchase the Company's personal computers,  as
opposed  to  MS-DOS  or Windows-based systems, are  often  based  on  the
availability  of  third-party software for particular applications.   The
Company   believes  that  the  availability  of  third-party  application
software for the Company's hardware products depends in part on the third-
party  developers'  perception and analysis of the relative  benefits  of
developing  such software for the Company's products versus software  for
the  larger MS-DOS and Windows market.  This analysis is based on factors
such  as  the  relative  market  share of  the  Company's  products,  the
anticipated  potential  revenue that may be  earned,  and  the  costs  of
developing such software products.  Microsoft Corporation is an important
developer   of   application  software  for   the   Company's   products.
Accordingly,  Microsoft's interest in producing application software  for
the Company's products may be influenced by Microsoft's perception of its
interests as an operating system vendor.

The  Company's ability to produce and market competitive products is also
dependent on the ability of IBM and Motorola, Inc., the suppliers of  the
PowerPC  RISC  microprocessor for certain of the Company's  products,  to
continue  to supply to the Company microprocessors that produce  superior
price/performance results compared with those supplied to  the  Company's
competitors  by  Intel Corporation, the developer  and  producer  of  the
microprocessors  used  by most personal computers using  the  MS-DOS  and
Windows operating systems.  IBM produces personal computers based on  the
Intel  microprocessors as well as on the PowerPC microprocessor,  and  is
also the developer of OS/2, a competing operating system to the Company's
Macintosh operating system.  Accordingly, IBM's interest in supplying the
Company  with  improved  versions of microprocessors  for  the  Company's
products  may  be influenced by IBM's perception of its  interests  as  a
competing manufacturer of personal computers and as a competing operating
system vendor.

The  Company's future operating results and financial condition may  also
be   affected  by  the  Company's  ability  to  successfully  expand  and
capitalize  on its investments in other markets, such as the markets  for
Internet services and personal digital assistant (PDA) products.




                                       14



Global Market Risks

A   large   portion  of  the  Company's  revenue  is  derived  from   its
international  operations.   As a result, the  Company's  operations  and
financial  results  could  be  significantly  affected  by  international
factors,  such  as  changes in foreign currency exchange  rates  or  weak
economic  conditions  in  the  foreign  markets  in  which  the   Company
distributes its products.  When the U.S. dollar strengthens against other
currencies,  the  U.S.  dollar  value  of  non-U.S.  dollar-based   sales
decreases.  When the U.S. dollar weakens, the U.S. dollar value  of  non-
U.S. dollar-based sales increases. Correspondingly, the U.S. dollar value
of non-U.S. dollar-based costs increases when the U.S. dollar weakens and
decreases  when the U.S. dollar strengthens.  Overall, the Company  is  a
net  receiver  of  currencies other than the U.S. dollar  and,  as  such,
benefits  from  a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by  a  stronger
dollar  relative to major currencies worldwide.  Accordingly, changes  in
exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may
negatively affect the Company's consolidated sales and gross margins  (as
expressed in U.S. dollars).

To  mitigate the short-term impact of fluctuating currency exchange rates
on  the  Company's non-U.S. dollar-based sales, product procurement,  and
operating  expenses,  the Company regularly hedges its  non-U.S.  dollar-
based  exposures.  Specifically, the Company enters into foreign exchange
forward  and  option  contracts to hedge firmly  committed  transactions.
Currently,  hedges of firmly committed transactions do not extend  beyond
one  year.   The Company also purchases foreign exchange option contracts
to  hedge  certain other probable, but not firmly committed transactions.
Hedges  of  probable, but not firmly committed transactions currently  do
not  extend  beyond one year.  To reduce the costs associated with  these
ongoing  foreign  exchange hedging programs, the Company  also  regularly
sells  foreign  exchange option contracts and enters into  certain  other
foreign  exchange transactions.  All foreign exchange forward and  option
contracts  not  accounted  for  as  hedges,  including  all  transactions
intended  to  reduce  the  costs associated with  the  Company's  foreign
exchange hedging programs, are carried at fair value and are adjusted  on
each  balance  sheet date for changes in exchange rates.   Refer  to  the
Financial  Instruments  footnote on  pages  26  -  28  of  the  Notes  to
Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

While the Company is exposed with respect to fluctuations in the interest
rates  of  many  of  the  world's leading industrialized  countries,  the
Company's  interest income and expense is most sensitive to  fluctuations
in  the general level of U.S. interest rates.  In this regard, changes in
U.S.  interest  rates affect the interest earned on the  Company's  cash,
cash equivalents, and short-term investments as well as interest paid  on
its short-term borrowings and long-term debt.  To mitigate the impact  of
fluctuations  in  U.S.  interest rates,  the  Company  has  entered  into
interest  rate swap and option transactions.  Certain of these swaps  are
intended  to better match the Company's floating-rate interest income  on
its  cash,  cash equivalents, and short-term investments with the  fixed-
rate  interest  expense on its long-term debt.  The Company  also  enters
into  interest rate swap and option transactions in order to diversify  a
portion  of  the Company's exposure away from fluctuations in  short-term
U.S.  interest  rates.  These instruments may extend the  Company's  cash
investment horizon up to a maximum effective duration of three years.

To  ensure  the  adequacy  and effectiveness  of  the  Company's  foreign
exchange  and  interest rate hedge positions, as well as to  monitor  the
risks   and  opportunities  of  the  nonhedge  portfolios,  the   Company
continually  monitors its foreign exchange forward and option  positions,
and  its  interest rate swap and option positions on a stand-alone  basis
and  in  conjunction with its underlying foreign currency-  and  interest
rate-related  exposures, respectively, from both  an  accounting  and  an
economic  perspective.   However, given the  effective  horizons  of  the
Company's risk management activities, there can be no assurance that  the
aforementioned  programs will offset more than a portion of  the  adverse
financial  impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either  foreign
exchange  or  interest rates.  In addition, the timing of the  accounting
for recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments
for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses
related  to the underlying economic exposures, and as such, may adversely
affect  the  Company's  operating results and  financial  position.   The
Company generally does not engage in leveraged hedging.

Inventory and Supply

The  Company's ability to satisfy demand for its products may be  limited
by  the  availability of key components.  The Company believes  that  the
availability  from  suppliers  to  the  personal  computer  industry   of
microprocessors  and  ASICs presents the most significant  potential  for
constraining  the  Company's  ability  to  produce  products.    Specific
microprocessors  manufactured by Motorola, Inc.  and  IBM  are  currently
available  only  from single sources, while some advanced microprocessors
are currently in the early stages of ramp-up for production and thus have
limited  availability.  The Company and other producers in  the  personal
computer  industry  also  compete for other semiconductor  products  with
other  industries  that  have  experienced  increased  demand  for   such
products,  due  to either increased consumer demand or increased  use  of
semiconductors  in  their  products  (such  as  the  cellular  phone  and
automotive  industries).  Finally, the Company uses some components  that
are  not  common to the rest of the personal computer industry (including
certain  ASICs).   Continued  availability of  these  components  may  be
affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production  of
common  components  instead of custom components.   Such  product  supply
constraints and corresponding increased costs could adversely affect  the
Company's  future  operating results and financial  condition,  including
loss of market share.


                                       15



The  Company's future operating results and financial condition may  also
be adversely affected by the Company's ability to manage inventory levels
and  lead  times  required  to obtain components  in  order  to  be  more
responsive  to  short-term  shifts  in  customer  demand  patterns.    In
addition,  if  anticipated unit sales growth for new and current  product
offerings  is  not  realized, the Company's  results  of  operations  and
financial condition could be adversely affected.

Marketing and Distribution

A  number  of uncertainties may affect the marketing and distribution  of
the  Company's  products.   Currently, the  Company's  primary  means  of
distribution  is  through third-party computer resellers.   However,  the
Company is continuing its expansion into various consumer channels,  such
as  mass-merchandise stores, consumer electronics outlets,  and  computer
superstores.   The  Company's  business and financial  results  could  be
adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers  weakens
or  if  resellers  within consumer channels decide  not  to  continue  to
distribute the Company's products.

Other Factors

The  majority  of the Company's research and development activities,  its
corporate  headquarters,  and  other  critical  business  operations  are
located  near major seismic faults. The Company's operating  results  and
financial  condition could be materially adversely affected in the  event
of a major earthquake.

The  Company  is  currently  in  the process  of  replacing  its  current
transaction   systems  (which  include  order  management,  distribution,
manufacturing, and finance) with a single integrated system  as  part  of
its  ongoing  effort to increase operational efficiency.   The  Company's
future  operating  results  and financial condition  could  be  adversely
affected  if  it  is  unable  to implement  and  effectively  manage  the
transition to this new integrated system.

In  April  1995,  the  Company  announced  a  companywide  reorganization
designed  to  more  closely align the Company's organizational  structure
with  the  Company's  business strategy of  placing  increased  focus  on
customer  needs  and expanding its presence in the home,  education,  and
business  markets.   In November 1995, the Company  announced  a  further
companywide reorganization to accelerate the implementation of its market
segmentation strategy.  The Company's reorganization will result  in  the
consolidation   of   its   sales,  marketing,  and   customer   solutions
organization  into three geographic business units, namely, the  Americas,
Europe,  and Japan and Asia.  The Company's future operating results  and
financial  condition  could  be adversely  affected  by  its  ability  to
effectively manage the transition to these new organizational structures.
Although  it  is  uncertain at this time, the Company  may  incur  future
restructuring charges as a result of these reorganizations.

Historically, the Company has experienced increased sales  in  its  first
and  fourth fiscal quarters due to holiday demand for and calendar  year-
end  buying  of  some  of its products.  As of the date  of  this  Annual
Report,  published  reports  relating to the  U.S.  economy  indicated  a
potentially  unfavorable year-end buying season.   Any  general  economic
slowdown could adversely affect demand for the Company's products,  which
could  adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial
condition.

Because of the foregoing factors, as well as other factors affecting  the
Company's  operating  results  and financial  condition,  past  financial
performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future
performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate
results  or  trends  in  future  periods.   In  addition,  the  Company's
participation  in a highly dynamic industry often results in  significant
volatility of the Company's common stock price.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The  Company's financial position with respect to cash, cash equivalents,
and  short-term investments, net of short-term borrowings,  decreased  to
$491  million  at September 29, 1995, from $966 million at September  30,
1994.

Less  cash  was  generated  by operations in  1995  compared  with  1994,
primarily  as a result of growth in inventory levels and an  increase  in
accounts  receivable.   Inventory levels grew during  1995  in  order  to
support anticipated demand in the first quarter of 1996 for the Company's
new  products.  Accounts receivable also increased, reflecting the higher
sales levels achieved during 1995, primarily toward the end of the fourth
quarter.

Cash  used  for operations in 1995 was partially offset by cash generated
from  higher  sales  and accounts payable levels.   The  increased  sales
levels  were driven by aggressive pricing and promotional actions coupled
with  strong  demand for the Company's PowerPC processor-based  products.
Accounts  payable  increased as a result of the growth in  inventory  and
production levels and longer payment terms negotiated with vendors.

More  cash  was  generated  by operations in  1994  compared  with  1993,
primarily due to a significant decrease in inventory levels, as  well  as
increased  sales  levels.  The significant decrease in  inventory  levels
during 1994 resulted from improved inventory

                                       16



management, higher 1994 sales levels attributable to various pricing  and
promotional actions, and strong sales of new product inventory which  had
been  built  up  in preparation for the introduction of Power  Macintosh.
Profit  levels  improved  as  operating expenses  decreased  due  to  the
Company's implementation of restructuring actions initiated in the  third
quarter of 1993.

Cash  generated by operations in 1994 was partially offset by  cash  used
for  restructuring and an increase in accounts receivable.  The  increase
in  accounts  receivable reflected an increase in sales  levels  achieved
during 1994.  The balance of accrued restructuring costs decreased as the
restructuring actions initiated in the third quarter of 1993 continued to
be  implemented.  In addition, in the third quarter of 1994, the  Company
lowered  its estimate of the costs associated with the restructuring  and
recorded  an  adjustment  that  increased income  by  $127  million  ($79
million,  or  $0.66  per share, after taxes).  This adjustment  primarily
reflected  the  modification or cancelation of certain  elements  of  the
Company's  original restructuring plan because of changing  business  and
economic conditions that made certain elements of the restructuring  plan
financially less attractive than originally anticipated.

Excluding short-term investments, net cash used for investments increased
in  1995  compared  with 1994 and 1993 levels.  Net  cash  used  for  the
purchase of property, plant, and equipment totaled $159 million in  1995,
and  was  primarily made up of increases in manufacturing  machinery  and
equipment.   The  Company anticipates that capital expenditures  in  1996
will remain relatively consistent with 1995 expenditure levels.

The  Company  leases the majority of its facilities and  certain  of  its
equipment  under noncancelable operating leases.  In 1995,  rent  expense
under all operating leases was approximately $127 million.  The Company's
future  lease  commitments are discussed on  page  34  of  the  Notes  to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Short-term  borrowings  at September 29, 1995,  were  approximately  $169
million  higher  than  at  September  30,  1994.  These  borrowings  were
primarily made to fund expected working capital growth in certain markets
worldwide.   In  general,  the  Company's short-term  borrowings  reflect
borrowings  made under its commercial paper program and short-term  loans
from  certain  commercial banks.  In particular, Apple  Japan,  Inc.  and
Apple Computer BV (Netherlands), subsidiaries of the Company, held short-
term  borrowings from several banks, totaling approximately $199  million
and $262 million, respectively, at September 29, 1995.

The  Company's  balance  of long-term debt remained  relatively  constant
during  1995.  In 1994, $300 million aggregate principal amount  of  6.5%
unsecured notes were issued under an omnibus shelf registration statement
filed   with   the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission.   This   shelf
registration was for the registration of debt and other securities for an
aggregate  offering  amount of $500 million.   The  notes  were  sold  at
99.925%  of par, for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%.  The  notes
pay  interest semi-annually and mature on February 15, 2004.   The  6.51%
fixed  rate  was  subsequently effectively converted to a  floating  rate
through ten-year interest rate swaps based on the three-month U.S. dollar
London  Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR").  To mitigate  the  credit  risk
associated  with  these ten-year swap transactions, the  Company  entered
into  margining  agreements  with  its third-party  bank  counterparties.
Margining under these agreements does not start until 1997.  Furthermore,
these agreements would require the Company to post margin only if certain
credit  risk thresholds were exceeded.  It is anticipated that any margin
the  Company  may  be required to post in the future  would  not  have  a
material adverse effect on the Company's liquidity position.

The  Company expects that it will continue to incur short- and  long-term
borrowings  from time to time to finance U.S. working capital  needs  and
capital  expenditures,  because a substantial portion  of  the  Company's
cash,  cash  equivalents, and short-term investments is held  by  foreign
subsidiaries,  generally  in U.S. dollar-denominated  holdings.   Amounts
held  by  foreign  subsidiaries would be subject to U.S. income  taxation
upon   repatriation  to  the  United  States;  the  Company's   financial
statements  fully provide for any related tax liability on  amounts  that
may be repatriated.  Refer to the Income Taxes footnote on pages 31 -  32
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

The  Company  believes that its balances of cash, cash  equivalents,  and
short-term investments, together with funds generated from operations and
short-  and long-term borrowing capabilities, will be sufficient to  meet
its operating cash requirements on a short- and long-term basis.

Executive Overview  


Apple designs, manufactures and markets personal computers and related software, services, peripherals and networking solutions. The Company also designs, develops and markets
a line of portable digital music 


23








 


players
along with related accessories and services including the online distribution of third-party music and audio books. The Company's products and services include the Macintosh line of desktop
and notebook computers, the iPod digital music player, the Xserve server and Xserve RAID storage products, a portfolio of consumer and professional software applications, the Mac OS X
operating system, the online iTunes Music Store, a portfolio of peripherals that support and enhance the Macintosh and iPod product lines, and a variety of other service and support offerings. The
Company sells its products worldwide through its online stores, its own retail stores, its direct sales force, and third-party wholesalers, resellers and value added resellers. In addition, the
Company sells a variety of third-party Macintosh compatible products, including computer printers and printing supplies, storage devices, computer memory, digital video and still cameras, personal
digital assistants, and various other computing products and supplies through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to education, consumer, creative professional, business and government
customers. A further description of the Company's products may be found in Part I, Item 1 of this document under the heading "Business." 


The
Company's business strategy leverages its unique ability, through the design and development of its own operating system, hardware and many software applications and technologies, to bring to its
customers around the world compelling new products and solutions with superior ease-of-use, seamless integration and innovative industrial design. 


The
Company participates in several highly competitive markets, including personal computers with its Macintosh line of computers, consumer electronics with its iPod line of digital music players and
distribution of third-party digital music through its online iTunes Music Store. While the Company is widely recognized as an innovator in the personal computer market as well as a leader in the
emerging market for distribution of digital music, these are highly competitive markets that are subject to aggressive pricing and increased competition. In order to remain competitive, the Company
believes that increased investment in research and development (R&D) is necessary in order to maintain and extend its position in the markets where it competes. The Company's R&D spending is focused
on delivering timely updates and enhancements to its existing line of personal computers, displays, operating systems, software applications and portable music players; developing new digital
lifestyle consumer and professional software applications; and investing in new product areas such as rack-mount servers, RAID storage systems, and wireless technologies. 


The
Company utilizes a variety of direct and indirect distribution channels. The Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons
who can convey the value of the hardware, software and peripheral integration, demonstrate the unique digital lifestyle solutions that are available only on Macintosh computers, and demonstrate the
seamless
compatibility of the Macintosh with the Windows platform and networks. The Company further believes that providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to
attracting and retaining customers. To ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company has expanded and improved its
distribution capabilities by opening its own retail stores in the U.S. and internationally. The Company had 86 stores open as of September 25, 2004. 


The
Company has also staffed selected third-party stores with the Company's own employees to improve the buying experience through reseller channels. The Company has deployed Apple employees in
reseller locations around the world including the U.S., Europe, Japan and Australia. The Company also sells to customers direct through one of its online stores around the world. 


To
improve the accessibility of its iPod product line, the Company has significantly expanded the number of distribution points where iPods are sold. The iPod product line can now be purchased in
department stores, discount stores and specialty music and audio-visual stores.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  


The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company's discussion and analysis of
its financial condition and results of operations require the Company's management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used
in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be
material. 


Management
believes the Company's critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation and exposures related to
inventory purchase commitments, valuation of long-lived assets including acquired intangibles, warranty costs, and income taxes. Management believes these policies to be critical because
they are both important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. The
Company's senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. 


Revenue Recognition  


Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of products (i.e., hardware, software, and peripherals), and extended warranty and support contracts. The Company
recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards, including Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97-2, 
Software Revenue
Recognition
, as amended, and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, 
Revenue
Recognition.


The
Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered
delivered to the customer once it has been shipped, and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Company's product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is
shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the
Company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed not to be,
fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable. 


The
Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other
sales programs and volume-based incentives. The estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue in the period the Company has sold the product and committed to a plan. The
Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company's historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to
increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered. Additionally,
certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions
of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which could have
a material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations. 


25








 




Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  


The Company distributes its products through third-party resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and commercial customers. The Company generally does not require
collateral from its customers. However, when possible the Company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe and Asia
and by arranging with
third-party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the Company's direct customers. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the
third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade
receivables that are not covered by collateral, third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Company's distribution and retail channel partners. 


The
allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management's assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition
of those specific customers. The Company records an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that is reasonably believed to be collectible. The Company also records an allowance for
all other trade receivables based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts, the general economic environment, the financial condition of the Company's distribution channels,
and the aging of such receivables. If there is a deterioration of a major customer's financial condition, if the Company becomes aware of additional information related to the credit worthiness of a
major customer, or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the Company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts, which
would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made. 


Inventory Valuation and Inventory Purchase Commitments  


The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. The Company records a write-down for inventories of
components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed
review of inventory each period that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component cost trends. The
personal computer industry is subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. If future demand or market conditions for the Company's products are
less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory, the Company may be required to record additional write-downs which would
negatively affect gross margins in the period when the write-downs are recorded. 


The
Company accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a
combination of formal purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. These commitments typically cover the Company's requirements for periods ranging from
30 to 130 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Company's products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the
Company's products, the Company may be required to record additional reserves for cancellation fees that would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the cancellation fees are identified. 


Valuation of Long-Lived Assets Including Acquired Intangibles  


The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying
amount of such an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate.
If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of 


26








 


the
assets exceeds their fair market value. Although the Company has recognized no material impairment adjustments related to its property, plant, and equipment or identifiable intangibles during the
past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in the Company's business in a geographic region or business segment in the future, including
deterioration in the performance of individual retail stores, could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods in which such business issues are identified. 


In
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
, the Company performs a
review of goodwill for impairment annually, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. The review of goodwill for potential impairment is highly subjective and requires that:
(1) goodwill be allocated to various reporting units of the Company's business to which it relates; (2) the Company estimate the fair value of those reporting units to which the goodwill
relates; and (3) the Company determine the book value of those reporting units. If the estimated fair value of reporting units with allocated goodwill is determined to be less than their book
value, the Company is required to estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of those reporting units in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired
business. This requires independent valuation of certain internally developed and unrecognized assets including in-process research and development and developed technology. Once this
process is complete, the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, can be determined. 


Based
on the Company's estimates as of September 25, 2004 there was no impairment of goodwill. However, changes in various circumstances including changes in the Company's market
capitalization, changes in the Company's forecasts, and changes in the Company's internal business structure could cause one or more of the Company's reporting units to be valued differently thereby
causing an impairment of goodwill. Additionally, in response to changes in the personal computer industry and changes in global or regional economic conditions, the Company may strategically realign
its resources and consider restructuring, disposing, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of property, plant, and equipment, identifiable intangibles, or goodwill. 


Warranty Costs  


The Company provides currently for the estimated cost for product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim
rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company's typical experience. Each quarter, the Company
reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, and adjusts the amounts as
necessary. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could negatively affect the Company's results of
operations. 


Income Taxes  


The Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, 
 
Accounting for Income Taxes
, the
provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax
credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected
to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. 


Management
believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the
deferred tax 


27








 




liabilities,
will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, an
adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Similarly, if the Company subsequently realizes deferred tax assets that were previously
determined to be unrealizable, the respective valuation allowance would be reversed, resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings or a decrease in goodwill in the period such determination is made.
In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a
manner inconsistent with management's expectations could have a material impact on the Company's results of operations and financial position.

Fiscal Year 2004 versus 2003  


During fiscal 2004, net sales increased 33% or $2.1 billion from fiscal 2003. Several factors have contributed favorably to net sales during 2004: 







Net
sales of Macintosh systems increased $432 million or 10% during fiscal 2004 compared to 2003 while net sales per Macintosh unit sold remained relatively flat on a
year-over-year basis. Unit sales of Macintosh systems increased 278,000 units or 9% during fiscal 2004 compared to 2003. These increases in net sales and unit sales were a
result of strong demand for all of the Company's Macintosh systems, except for the iMac. The Company's portable systems, consisting of the PowerBook and iBook, produced the strongest revenue and unit
growth during fiscal 2004 compared to 2003 of approximately 26% and 33%, respectively. Unit sales of portable systems accounted for 51% of all Macintosh systems sold during fiscal 2004 compared to
only 42% during 2003. The Company believes that these results reflect an overall trend in the industry towards portable systems. Performance of the Company's Power Macintosh systems also yielded
positive results in fiscal 2004, including a 15% and 6% increase in net sales and unit sales, respectively. The increase in year-to-date Power Macintosh sales is due primarily
to the introduction of the Power Mac G5, which began shipping at the end of fiscal 2003. Although Power Macintosh sales have increased from the prior year, sales of this product were constrained in
the second half of 2004 as a result of manufacturing problems at IBM, the Company's sole supplier of the PowerPC G5 processor.


Net
sales of iPods rose $961 million or 279% during fiscal 2004 compared to 2003. Unit sales of iPods totaled 4.4 million in fiscal 2004, which represents an
increase of 370% from the 939,000 iPod units sold in fiscal 2003. Strong demand for the iPods during fiscal 2004 continued to be 




29








 






experienced
in all of the Company's operating segments and was driven by enhancements to the iPod, the introduction of the iPod mini, increased expansion of the Company's iPod distribution network,
and continued success of the iTunes Music Store due largely to making it available to both Macintosh and Windows users in the U.S., U.K., France and Germany. Since inception of the iPod product line
in fiscal 2002, the Company has sold approximately 5.7 million iPods. 







The
Retail segment's net sales grew 91% to $1.2 billion during fiscal 2004 compared to 2003. This increase is largely attributable to the increase in total stores
from 65 at the end of 2003 to 86 at the end of 2004, as well as a 36% year-over-year increase in average revenue per store. While the Company's customers in areas where the
Retail segment has opened stores may elect to purchase from the Retail segment stores rather than the Company's preexisting sales channels in the U.S. and Japan, the Company believes that a
substantial portion of the Retail segment's net sales is incremental to the Company's total net sales. See additional comments below related to the Retail segment under the heading "Segment Operating
Performance."


Net
sales of peripherals and other hardware rose by 38% during fiscal 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to an increase in net sales of displays and other computer
accessories. Net sales of other computer accessories include AirPort cards and base stations, iSight digital video cameras, and third party hardware products. The increase in total net sales of
peripherals and other hardware is related to the overall increase in Macintosh unit sales and the introduction of new and updated peripheral products and was experienced predominantly by the Company's
Americas, Europe, and Retail segments.


Other
music products consists of sales associated with the iTunes Music Store and iPod related services and accessories. Net sales of other music products increased
$242 million or 672% during fiscal 2004 compared to 2003. The Company has experienced strong growth in sales of iPod services and accessories consistent with the increase in overall iPod unit
sales for fiscal 2004. The increased sales from the iTunes Music Store, which was originally introduced in April 2003, is primarily due to making the store available for Windows in
October 2003 and the introduction of the store in the U.K., France, and Germany in June 2004.


Net
sales of software rose $140 million or 39% during fiscal 2004 compared to 2003 due primarily to higher net sales of the Company's Apple-branded software and in
particular, higher net sales of the Company's operating system software, Mac OS X version 10.3 "Panther," which was released
in October 2003. Net sales of Panther accounted for approximately $74 million or over 50% of the increase in software net sales for fiscal 2004 compared to 2003.


The
Company's U.S. education channel experienced year-over-year growth in net sales of approximately 19% for fiscal 2004 compared to 2003. Unit sales
also increased by 10% during fiscal 2004 compared to 2003. The increase in U.S. education net sales for fiscal 2004 relates primarily to a 40% year-over-year increase in higher
education net sales and to a lesser extent the Company's 3% growth in K-12 net sales. 




The
Company believes the U.S. K-12 education market remains challenging due to multiple factors including funding pressures due to weak economic conditions, large budget deficits in many
states, and increased competition particularly for desktop computers. Although the Company has taken steps, and will continue to take steps, to address weakness in the U.S. education channel, it
remains difficult to anticipate when and if this trend will reverse. 



Service
and other sales increased $37 million or 13% during fiscal 2004 compared to 2003. These increases are the result of significant
year-over-year increases in net sales associated with AppleCare Protection Plan (APP) extended maintenance and support services, as well as increases in net sales associated
with the Company's .Mac Internet service. Increased net sales associated with APP are primarily the result of higher Macintosh unit sales and higher attach rates on APP over the last several years. 




30


















 
 
 

Offsetting the favorable factors discussed above, the Company's net sales during fiscal 2004 were negatively impacted by the following: 







Net
sales and unit sales of iMac systems were down 23% and 16%, respectively, during fiscal 2004 versus 2003. The decrease in iMac net sales and unit sales was largely due
to the delay in the introduction of the new iMac, based on the PowerPC G5 processor, primarily as a result of manufacturing problems experienced by IBM. The delays in the new iMac resulted in the
depletion of inventory of the old iMac flat panel prior to availability of the new iMac G5. The old flat panel iMac form factor which was available during most of fiscal 2004, was nearly
3 years old by the time the new iMac G5 began shipping in September 2004 and had experienced declines in sales as a result of the age of this product. The Company believes that sales of
iMac systems have also declined due to a shift in consumer preference to portable systems and competitor desktop models with price points below $1,000. The Company introduced a new version of the eMac
in April 2004 with a suggested retail price starting at $799 aimed at the price sensitive customer.


Net
sales and unit sales in the Company's Japan segment decreased 3% and 14%, respectively, during fiscal 2004 versus 2003. The Company believes these declines relate to a
shift in sales from the Japan Segment to the Retail segment as a result of the Tokyo and Osaka store openings in fiscal 2004. Declines in Japan may also relate to delays in computer upgrades by
certain professional and creative customers pending release in Japan of certain Mac OS X native applications, such as Quark Xpress 6, which did not become available until
September 2004. When sales from the Japan retail stores are included in the results for the Japan segment, the combined revenue in Japan resulted in a 3% year-over-year
increase in fiscal 2004 as compared to 2003. See additional comments below related to the Japan segment under the heading "Segment Operating Performance." 




Fiscal Year 2003 versus 2002  


Net sales increased $465 million or 8% during 2003 compared to 2002 while Macintosh unit sales declined 3% year-over-year to approximately
3 million units in 2003. Several factors contributed favorably to net sales during 2003 including: 







The
Retail segment's net sales grew to $621 million during 2003 from $283 million in 2002, an increase of 119%. While the Company's customers may have elected
to purchase product from their local Apple Retail store rather than through other preexisting sales channels in the U.S., the Company believes that a substantial portion of the Retail segment's net
sales was incremental to total net sales. See additional comments below related to the Retail segment under the heading "Segment Operating Performance."


Net
sales of iPods rose $202 million or 141% during 2003 compared to 2002. This increase was experienced by all of the Company's operating segments. iPod sales during
2003 were favorably affected by the introduction of substantially redesigned new models, which were compatible with both Macintosh and Windows operating systems. The Company's iPod digital music
player is sold by a variety of resellers, many of which do not currently market the Company's Macintosh systems. The Company expanded this distribution network during 2003, which contributed to the
2003 increase in iPod unit sales of 146%.


The
Company also experienced an increase in net sales of peripherals and other hardware totaling $164 million or 31% during 2003 compared to 2002, reflecting an
overall increase in net sales of other computer accessories including AirPort cards and base stations, which facilitate wireless connectivity; third party digital cameras and printers; and a number of
portable computer related accessories.


Net
sales of other music products, including sales associated with the iTunes Music Store and iPod related services and accessories, increased $32 million or 800%
during 2003 compared to 2002. This increase was due primarily to the introduction of the iTunes Music Store for the Macintosh 




31








 






operating
system in April 2003 and higher sales of iPod services and accessories consistent with the increase in iPod net sales and unit sales during 2003. 







Although
total Macintosh unit sales were down 3% in 2003, unit sales of the Company's portable systems were relatively strong primarily due to the 69% or 247,000 unit
increase in PowerBook unit sales, slightly offset by a 4% or 30,000 unit decrease in iBook unit sales. The increase in PowerBook net sales of $468 million or 56% was due primarily to the
success of the Company's new 12-inch, 15-inch and 17-inch models that were introduced during 2003. The decline in iBook consumer portable sales during 2003 was
primarily due to a lower average price per unit. Portable systems represented 42% of all Macintosh systems sold in 2003 versus 33% in 2002, which reflected an overall industry trend towards portable
systems.


The
Company's average net sales per Macintosh unit sold increased 2% to $1,491 in 2003 as a result of various changes in overall unit mix towards relatively higher-priced
PowerBook systems and increases direct sales primarily from the Company's retail and online stores, offset by somewhat lower year-over-year pricing on comparable Macintosh
systems for most of the Company's Macintosh product lines in response to industry pricing pressure, particularly with the Company's iBook consumer portable systems. PowerBook and Power Macintosh
systems accounted for 42% of total unit sales in 2003 versus 36% in 2002.


Net
sales of software increased $55 million or 18% during 2003 compared to the prior year and reflected higher net sales of Apple-branded application and server
software and third-party software. Net sales of Apple-branded application and server software increased due to the introduction of several new software titles during fiscal 2003 including Final Cut
Express, iLife, and Keynote, as well as from higher sales of software related to recent acquisitions including PowerSchool and Emagic. Growth in net sales of third-party software during 2003 was
particularly strong in the Americas Segment due to strong sales of software by the Company's online store and its Retail segment.


Service
and other sales rose $55 million or 24% during 2003 which primarily resulted from significant year-over-year increases in net sales
associated with APP extended maintenance and support services, as well as the Company's Internet related services. Increased net sales associated with APP were primarily the result of increasing
attach rates over the last several years. Increased net sales associated with Internet services were due to increased net sales of the Company's .Mac Internet service. 




Offsetting
the favorable factors discussed above, the Company's net sales during 2003 were negatively impacted by the following factors: 







Total
unit sales of desktop systems fell 15% during 2003 compared to 2002. iMac systems unit sales declined 16% from 2003 to 2002 resulting from a shift in sales away from
desktop systems in favor of portables. Also, the flat panel iMac form factor available during fiscal 2003 was in the eighth quarter of its life cycle by the end of 2003.


Unit
sales of Power Macintosh systems fell 13% during 2003 compared to 2002. For the first nine months of 2003 compared to the same period in 2002, unit sales of Power
Macintosh systems decreased 24%, which was representative of the decline of Power Macintosh systems sales experienced by the Company during recent years and was also believed to be attributable to
delays in purchasing pending the release of the Power Mac G5. As expected, this trend reversed in the fourth quarter of 2003 with unit sales increasing 26% during the quarter as compared to the
same period in the prior year due largely to the new Power Mac G5, which the Company introduced in June 2003 and began shipping at the end of fiscal 2003. The decline in Power Macintosh
sales over the previous several years also reflects the shift in sales to portable systems, particularly PowerBooks. In addition, the Company believes that weak economic conditions over the past 




32








 






several
years had a pronounced negative impact on its professional and creative customers. Additionally, some of the Company's professional and creative customers may have delayed upgrades of their
systems in anticipation of certain software vendors transitioning their professionally oriented Macintosh software applications to run natively on Mac OS X. 







The
Company experienced ongoing weakness in its U.S. education channel during 2003. Net sales and unit sales in U.S. education during 2003 were down 4% and 6%, respectively,
as compared to 2002. This decline was due to a decrease in K-12 sales, partially offset by an increase in higher education sales. Net sales declined primarily as a result of a continued
shift in mix away from higher priced Power Macintosh and iMac systems towards lower priced eMac and iBook systems, although the Company did experience a significant increase in sales of its PowerBook
systems primarily to higher education customers. Portable systems accounted for approximately 43% of total unit sales in the education channel during 2003, as compared to approximately 34% in 2002. 




Segment Operating Performance  


The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable operating segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The
Americas segment includes both North and South America, except for the activities of the Company's Retail segment. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa.
The Japan segment includes only Japan and excludes revenue from the Company's own retail stores in Japan, which is included in the Company's Retail segment. The Retail segment operated Apple-owned
retail stores in the U.S. and Japan during fiscal 2004. Each reportable geographic operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services. Further information regarding
the Company's operating segments may be found in Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 11, "Segment Information and
Geographic Data." 


Americas  


During fiscal 2004, net sales in the Americas segment grew 26% or $838 million compared to fiscal 2003. The increase in net sales during 2004 was primarily attributable
to the significant year-over-year increase in iPod sales as well as strong sales of peripherals, software, and services. This increase was partially offset by a shift in sales
to the Retail segment, which had 84 stores in the U.S. as of the end of fiscal 2004. Macintosh unit sales also increased by 4% in fiscal 2004 compared to 2003, driven primarily by strong sales of
portable and Power Macintosh systems, partially offset by continued weakness in iMac sales. During 2004 and 2003, the Americas segment represented approximately 49% and 51%, respectively, of the
Company's total net sales and represented approximately 51% and 54%, respectively, of total Macintosh unit sales. As noted above, the Company experienced an increase in U.S. education channel net
sales of 19% for fiscal 2004 compared to 2003. Strong U.S. education net sales for the current year relate primarily to strength in higher education net sales that resulted from a successful
back-to-school selling season with strong demand for the Company's portables. This strength drove year-over-year growth in net sales of 40% for the
higher education channel during fiscal 2004. The Company's K-12 net sales grew year-over-year by 3% during fiscal 2004, despite the challenges in the
K-12 market from continued budget constraints and increased competition, due to the Company's continued focus and success with delivering 1:1 education solutions. 


Net
sales in the Americas segment during 2003 increased $50 million or 2% compared to 2002. During 2003 and 2002, the Americas segment represented approximately 51% and 55%, respectively, of
the Company's total net sales and represented approximately 54% and 56%, respectively, of total Macintosh unit sales. The results of the Americas segment are similar to the overall results of the
Company as they reflect substantially lower unit sales and net sales of Power Macintosh systems and iMac systems, partially offset by increases in unit sales and net sales of PowerBooks. The net sales
of the Americas segment, and the Company in total, also reflect substantially higher sales of iPods, peripherals, software, and services during 2003 compared to 2002. The Americas segment had been
negatively affected by weakness in its U.S. education channel during 2003. Total net sales and unit sales in the U.S. education channel during 2003 


33








 




were
down 4% and 6%, respectively, compared to the same period in 2002. The Company believes this decline was caused by increased competition in the education market and by a reduction in spending by
U.S. educational institutions due to federal and state funding concerns and tax revenue shortfalls resulting from the weak economy. Additionally, some of the decline during 2003 in net sales and unit
sales of Macintosh systems in the Americas segment may be the result of the operation of the Company's Retail segment whose net sales, all of which occurred within the U.S., increased significantly
during 2003. 


Europe  


Net sales in Europe rebounded in fiscal 2004 increasing $490 million or 37% from 2003. Total Macintosh unit sales in Europe also experienced growth during the current
year by increasing 13% in fiscal 2004 compared to 2003. Consistent with the Americas segment, Europe experienced strong net sales across all product lines, except for the iMac systems. Demand in
Europe during fiscal 2004 was particularly strong for the Company's Power Macintosh systems and portable Macintosh systems, which experienced year-over-year increases of 29%
and 42%, respectively. Similar to the results of the Company's other segments, net sales of iPods, peripherals and software were strong in fiscal 2004. 


Net
sales in Europe increased $58 million or 5% during 2003 as compared to 2002 while Macintosh unit sales declined by 5% during the same period. Europe's operating results were consistent with
the trend experienced in the Americas and by the Company as a whole. Europe experienced weakened demand for Power Macintosh, iMac and iBook systems in 2003, partially offset by strong demand for
PowerBooks whose net sales increased by 48% or $100 million from 2002. Europe also realized increased sales of iPods, peripherals, software, and services. 


Japan  


The Japan segment continues to be a challenge for the Company, with four consecutive years of year-over-year declines in both net sales and Macintosh
unit sales. Japan's net sales and unit sales were down 3% and 14%, respectively during fiscal 2004 compared to 2003, continuing to lag behind all of the Company's other operating segments. These
decreases in net sales and unit sales are believed to be attributable in part to a shift in sales from the Japan segment to the Retail segment as a result of the opening of two stores in Japan in
fiscal 2004. In addition, such decreases may have been related to delayed computer system upgrades by some professional and creative customers who were awaiting the release of Quark XPress 6
for Mac OS X, which did not occur until September 2004. The decrease in net sales was partially offset by strong iPod and iBook sales during fiscal 2004 compared to 2003. 


Net
sales in Japan decreased $12 million or 2% during 2003 as compared to the same period in 2002, the weakest year-to-date performance of any of the Company's operating
segments. Japan's Macintosh unit sales were particularly weak in 2003, declining 12%, and were primarily attributable to lower sales of iMac and iBook systems, partially offset by an increase in
PowerBook sales as well as higher sales of iPods, and peripherals and other hardware. Japan's Macintosh unit sales remained significantly below the segment's historic levels due to economic conditions
that remained particularly negative in Japan. 


Retail  


The Company opened 21 new retail stores during 2004, including its first two international stores in Tokyo and Osaka, Japan, bringing the total number of open stores to 86 as
of September 25, 2004. This compares to 65 open stores as of September 27, 2003 and 40 open stores as of September 28, 2002. During the first quarter of 2005, the
Company anticipates opening approximately 14 additional stores to end the calendar year at approximately 100 stores. Approximately half of the stores expected to open during the first quarter of 2005
will be in the new "mini" store design, which is the Company's smallest store format to date; allowing it to be placed in a variety of new locations to introduce the Company's innovative products to
even more customers. The Company also opened its third international store in London, England during the first quarter of 2005. 


34








 


Net
sales of the Retail segment grew to $1.185 billion during 2004 from $621 million and $283 million, in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increases in net sales during both 2004
and 2003 reflect the impact of new store openings for each fiscal year, including the opening of 21 new stores in 2004 and 25 new stores in 2003. An increase in average revenue per store also
contributed to the segment's strong sales in fiscal 2004. With an average of 76 stores open during 2004, the Retail segment achieved annualized revenue per store of approximately $15.6 million,
as compared to $11.5 million in 2003 with a 54 store average and $10.2 million in 2002 with a 28 store average. 


As
measured by the Company's operating segment reporting, the Retail segment reported profit of $39 million during fiscal 2004 as compared to losses of $5 million and $22 million
during 2003 and 2002, respectively. This improvement is primarily attributable to the segment's year-over-year increase in average quarterly revenue per store, the impact of
opening new stores, and the segment's year-over-year increase in net sales, which resulted in higher leverage on occupancy, depreciation and other fixed costs. 


Expansion
of the Retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure, operating lease commitments, personnel, and other
operating expenses. Capital expenditures associated with the Retail segment were $104 million in fiscal 2004, bringing the total capital expenditures since inception of the Retail segment to
approximately $394 million. As of September 25, 2004, the Retail segment had approximately 2,100 employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with retail store
space and related facilities of approximately $436 million. The Company would incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate its Retail segment or close individual stores. Such costs
could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition.

Gross
margin declined in fiscal 2004 to 27.3% of net sales from 27.5% of net sales in 2003. The Company's gross margin during fiscal 2004 declined due to an increase in mix towards lower margin iPod
and iBook sales, pricing actions on certain Power Macintosh G5 models that were transitioned during the beginning of 2004, higher warranty costs on certain portable Macintosh products, and higher
freight and duty costs during fiscal 2004. These unfavorable factors were partially offset by an increase in direct sales and a 39% year-over-year increase in higher margin
software sales. 


The
Company anticipates that its gross margin and the gross margin of the overall personal computer and consumer electronics industries will remain under pressure throughout fiscal 2005 in light of
price competition, especially for the iPod product line. The Company also expects to continue to incur air
freight charges, which negatively impact gross margins on the iMac and other products during the first quarter of 2005 and possibly beyond. 


The
foregoing statements regarding the Company's expected gross margin during 2005, general demand for personal computers, anticipated air freight charges, and future economic conditions are forward-
looking. There can be no assurance that current gross margins will be maintained or targeted gross margin levels will be achieved. In general, gross margins and margins on individual products,
including iPods, will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide 


35








 




global
pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, potential increases in the cost and availability of raw material and outside manufacturing services, and potential
changes to the Company's product mix, including higher unit sales of consumer products with lower average selling prices and lower gross margins. In response to these downward pressures, the Company
expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its products. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company's ability to effectively manage product quality and warranty costs
and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. The Company's operating strategy and pricing take into account anticipated changes in foreign currency exchange rates over time; however, the
Company's results of operations can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates. 


The
Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product shipments. Because the Company's markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there
is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third-parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products or components. The Company's operating results and
financial condition in the past have been and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the Company's ability to manage its inventory levels and outstanding purchase commitments and to
respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns. 


Gross
margin decreased to 27.5% of net sales in 2003 from 27.9% of net sales in 2002. This decline in gross margin reflects relatively aggressive pricing actions on several Macintosh models instituted
by the Company beginning in late fiscal 2002 as a result of continued pricing pressure throughout the personal computer industry, lower sales of relatively higher margin Power Macintosh systems during
the first three fiscal quarters of 2003, and increased air freight and manufacturing costs associated with the production ramp-up of the new Power Mac G5 and 15-inch PowerBook,
both of which began shipping in volume during September 2003. This decline is also attributable to a rise in certain component costs as the year progressed. The aforementioned negative factors
affecting gross margins during 2003 were partially offset by the increase in higher margin software and direct sales.

Research and Development (R&D)  


The Company recognizes that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely
development of new and enhanced products that are central to the Company's core business strategy. The Company has historically relied upon innovation to remain competitive. R&D expense amounted to
approximately 6% of total net sales during fiscal 2004 down from 8% of total net sales in both 2003 and 2002. This decrease is due to the significant increase of 33% in total net sales of the Company
for fiscal 2004. Although R&D expense decreased as a percentage of total net sales in fiscal 2004, actual expenditures for R&D in fiscal 2004 increased $18 million or 4% from fiscal 2003, which
follows a 6% or $25 million increase in 2003 compared to 2002. The overall increase in R&D expense relates primarily to increased headcount and support for new product development activities
and the impact of employee salary merit increases in 2004. R&D spending also included capitalized software development costs of approximately $4.5 million related to the 


36








 


development
of Mac OS X Tiger and $2.3 million related to the development of FileMaker Pro 7 in 2004; $14.7 million related to the development of
Mac OS X Panther in 2003; and approximately $13.3 million associated with the development of Mac OS X Jaguar and approximately $6 million associated with the
PowerSchool enterprise student information system in 2002. Further information related to the Company's capitalization of software development costs may be found in Part II, Item 8 of
this Form 10-K at Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 


Selling, General, and Administrative Expense (SG&A)  


Expenditures for SG&A increased $209 million or 17% during 2004 compared to 2003. These increases are due primarily to the Company's continued expansion of its Retail
segment in both domestic and international markets, a current year increase in discretionary spending on marketing and advertising, an increase in amortization costs associated with restricted stock
compensation, and higher direct and channel selling expenses resulting from the increase in net sales and employee salary merit increases. SG&A as a percentage of total net sales in 2004 was 17%, down
from 20% in 2003. This decrease is due to the increase of 33% in total net sales of the Company for fiscal 2004, reflecting leverage on the Company's fixed costs. 


SG&A
increased $103 million or 9% during 2003 as compared to 2002 due primarily to the Company's continued expansion of the Retail segment and increases in headcount. The overall increase was
partially offset by a decrease in 2003 discretionary spending on marketing and advertising and by savings resulting from the 2003 and 2002 restructuring activities described below. 


Fiscal 2004 Restructuring Actions  


The Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $23 million during the year ended September 25, 2004, including approximately $14 million
in severance costs, $5.5 million in asset impairments, and a $3.5 million charge for lease cancellations. Of the $23 million charge, $14.3 million had been spent by the end
of 2004, with the remaining $8.7 million consisting of $5.2 million for employee severance benefits and $3.5 million for lease cancellations. 


During
the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company recognized restructuring expense of $5.5 million. In conjunction with the European workforce reduction during the second quarter of 2004, the
Company vacated a leased sales facility during the fourth quarter of 2004 resulting in a charge of $3.7 million for contract termination and asset impairment costs. The Company also recognized
employee termination costs of $1.8 million related to the elimination of non-essential positions, principally in Europe. In addition, the Company reversed $400,000 of excess
restructuring expense from prior periods related primarily to lower than expected disposal costs on Sacramento manufacturing-related fixed assets. The net cost of the restructuring plans for the
fourth quarter of 2004 was $5.1 million, of which $300,000 had been paid prior to the end of 2004. These actions will result in the termination of 54 positions, 4 of which had been
terminated prior to the end of 2004. 


During
the third quarter of 2004, the Company finalized restructuring plans related to closing Company-owned manufacturing activities in Sacramento. In addition, the Company's management approved
restructuring plans related to certain headcount reductions primarily for various sales and marketing activities principally in the U.S. Total cost of the restructuring plan for the third quarter of
2004 was $7.9 million, of which $7.2 million had been paid prior to the end of 2004. These actions will result in the termination of 83 positions, 77 of which had been terminated prior
to the end of 2004. 


The
closing of manufacturing operations in Sacramento resulted in the elimination of 67 positions for a severance cost of $1.9 million and write-off of $5.3 million in
manufacturing-related fixed assets whose use ceased during the third quarter of 2004. Termination of sales and marketing activities, principally in the U.S., resulted in severance of
$0.7 million for the elimination of 16 positions. 


During
the second quarter of 2004, the Company's management approved restructuring plans related to the termination of Company-owned manufacturing activities in Sacramento and headcount reductions 


37








 




related
primarily to various sales and marketing activities in the U.S. and Europe. Total cost of the actions was $9.6 million for the termination of 348 positions. As of the end of the
fourth quarter of 2004, $6.8 million had been spent and 310 positions had been eliminated related to these actions. 


The
Company estimates the closing of the Sacramento manufacturing operations will result in reduced ongoing quarterly operating expenses of approximately $2 million. In addition, the Company
estimates that the remaining restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2004 will ultimately result in reduced ongoing quarterly operating expenses of approximately $6 million. 


Fiscal 2003 Restructuring Actions  


The Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $26.8 million during the year ended September 27, 2003, including approximately
$7.4 million in severance costs, a $5.0 million charge to write-off deferred compensation, $7.1 million in asset impairments and a $7.3 million charge for lease
cancellations. Of the $26.8 million charge, all had been spent by the end of 2004, except for approximately $3.0 million related to operating lease costs on abandoned facilities. During
the third quarter of 2003, approximately $500,000 of the amount originally accrued for lease cancellations was determined to be in excess due to the sublease of a property sooner than originally
estimated and an approximately $500,000 shortfall was identified in the severance accrual due to higher than expected severance costs related to the closure of the Company's Singapore manufacturing
operations. These adjustments had no net effect on reported operating expense. 


During
the second quarter of 2003, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions that resulted in recognition of a total restructuring charge of $2.8 million, including
$2.4 million in severance costs and $400,000 for asset write-offs and lease payments on an abandoned facility. Actions taken in the second quarter were for the most part
supplemental to actions initiated in the prior two quarters and focused on further headcount reductions in various sales and marketing functions in the Company's Americas and Europe operating segments
and further reductions associated with PowerSchool-related activities in the Americas operating segment, including an accrual for asset write-offs and lease payments on an abandoned
facility. The second quarter actions resulted in the termination of 93 employees. 


During
the first quarter of 2003, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of $24 million that resulted in the termination of manufacturing
operations at the Company-owned facility in Singapore, further reductions in headcount resulting from the shift in PowerSchool product strategy that took place at the end of fiscal 2002, and
termination of various sales and marketing activities in the U.S. and Europe. These restructuring actions resulted in the elimination of 260 positions worldwide. 


Closure
of the Company's Singapore manufacturing operations resulted in severance costs of $1.8 million and costs of $6.7 million to write-off manufacturing related fixed
assets, whose use ceased during the first quarter. PowerSchool related costs included severance of approximately $550,000 and recognition of $5 million of previously deferred stock compensation
that arose when PowerSchool was acquired by the Company in 2001 related to certain PowerSchool employee stockholders who were terminated in the first quarter of 2003. Termination of sales and
marketing activities and employees, principally in the U.S. and Europe, resulted in severance costs of $2.8 million and accrual of costs associated with operating leases on closed facilities of
$6.7 million. The
total net restructuring charge of $23 million recognized during the first quarter of 2003 also reflects the reversal of $600,000 of unused restructuring accrual originally made during the first
quarter of 2002. 


Fiscal 2002 Restructuring Actions  


During fiscal 2002, the Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $30 million related to actions intended to eliminate certain activities and better
align the Company's operating expenses with 


38








 


existing
general economic conditions and to partially offset the cost of continuing investments in new product development and investments in the Company's Retail operating segment. 


During
the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of approximately $6 million designed to reduce headcount costs in
corporate operations and sales and to adjust its PowerSchool product strategy. These restructuring actions resulted in the elimination of approximately 180 positions worldwide at a cost of
$1.8 million, all of which were eliminated by September 27, 2003. Eliminated positions were primarily in corporate operations, sales, and PowerSchool related research and development in
the Americas operating segment. The shift in product strategy at PowerSchool included discontinuing development and marketing of PowerSchool's PSE product. This shift resulted in the impairment of
previously capitalized development costs associated with the PSE product in the amount of $4.5 million. 


During
the first quarter of 2002, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of approximately $24 million. These restructuring actions resulted in
the elimination of approximately 425 positions worldwide at a cost of $8 million. Positions were eliminated primarily in the Company's operations, information systems, and administrative
functions. In addition, these restructuring actions also included significant changes in the Company's information systems strategy resulting in termination of equipment leases and cancellation of
existing projects and activities. The Company ceased using the assets associated with first quarter 2002 restructuring actions during that same quarter. Related lease and contract cancellation charges
totaled $12 million, and charges for asset impairments totaled $4 million. The first quarter 2002 restructuring actions were primarily related to corporate activity not allocated to
operating segments. During the first quarter of 2003, the Company reversed the remaining unused accrual of $600,000. 


Purchased In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D)  


During 2002, the Company acquired Emagic GmbH, a provider of professional software solutions for computer based music production, for approximately $30 million in cash;
$551,000 of which was
allocated to IPR&D. The amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition, because the technological feasibility of products under development had not been established and
no alternative future uses existed. The fair value of the IPR&D was determined using the income approach, which reflects the projected free cash flows that will be generated by the IPR&D projects and
that are attributable to the acquired technology, and discounting the projected net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 25%.

Gains and Losses on Non-current Investments  


Over the course of the last three years, the Company has held investments that were classified as available-for-sale in EarthLink Inc.
(EarthLink), Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai), ARM Holdings plc (ARM) and certain investments in private companies. Further information related to the Company's non-current debt
and equity investments may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 


During
2004, the Company sold its remaining 986,000 shares of Akamai stock. The transaction generated proceeds of approximately $5 million and a gain before taxes of approximately
$4 million. As of September 25, 2004, the Company does not have any non-current public company investments reflected in its consolidated balance sheet. 


During
2003, the Company sold 1,875,000 shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of approximately $9 million, and a gain before taxes of approximately $8 million. Additionally, the
Company sold its remaining investment in ARM stock, 278,000 shares, for net proceeds of approximately $295,000, and a gain before taxes of $270,000, and sold its remaining investment in EarthLink
stock, 6,540,000 shares, for net proceeds of approximately $37 million, and a gain before taxes of $2 million. 


During
2002, the Company determined that declines in the fair value of certain investments were other-than-temporary. As a result, the Company recognized a $44 million
charge to earnings to writedown the basis of its investment in EarthLink, a $6 million charge to earnings to writedown the basis of its investment in Akamai, and a $15 million charge to
earnings to writedown the basis of its investment in a private company investment. These losses in 2002 were partially offset by the sale of 117,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds of
$2 million and a gain before taxes of $223,000, the sale of 250,000 shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of $2 million and a gain before taxes of $710,000, and the sale of
approximately 4.7 million shares of ARM stock for both net proceeds and a gain before taxes of $21 million. 


Interest and Other Income, Net  


Total interest and other income, net decreased $30 million or 36% to $53 million during fiscal 2004 compared to $83 million in 2003 and $112 million
in 2002. These decreases are attributable primarily to declining investment yields on the Company's cash and short-term investments resulting from lower market interest and a shortening of
the average maturity of the Company's investment portfolio, as well as lower gains on sales of short-term investments in fiscal 2004. The weighted average interest rate earned by the
Company on its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments fell to 1.38% in 2004 compared to the 1.89% and 2.85% rates earned during 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company
occasionally sells short-term investments prior to their stated maturities. As a result of such sales, the Company recognized net gains of $1 million, $21 million and
$7 million during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decrease in total interest and other income, net during fiscal 2003 was also offset by the $6 million gain related to the
forward purchase agreement during the fourth quarter of 2003 which is further discussed below under the heading "Cumulative Effects of Accounting Changes." 


Interest
expense consisted primarily of interest on the Company's $300 million aggregate principal amount unsecured notes, which were repaid upon their maturity in February 2004,
partially offset by amortization of deferred gains realized in 2002 and 2001 that resulted from the closure of swap positions associated with the unsecured notes. The unsecured notes were sold at
99.925% of par for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. Total deferred gain resulting from the closure of debt swaps of approximately $23 million was fully amortized as of the notes'
maturity in February 2004. 


Provision for Income Taxes  


The Company's effective tax rate for the year ended September 25, 2004 was approximately 28%. The Company's effective rate differs from the statutory federal income tax
rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to 


40








 


be
indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. As of September 25, 2004, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of
$647 million before being offset against certain deferred tax liabilities and a valuation allowance for presentation on the Company's balance sheet. Management believes it is more likely than
not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining net deferred tax assets. As of
September 25, 2004, a valuation allowance of $30 million was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax losses that may not be realized. The valuation allowance
relates principally to the operating loss carryforwards acquired from NeXT and other acquisitions, the utilization of which is subject to certain limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The
Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance. 


The
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed its field audit of the Company's federal income tax returns for all years prior to 2001 and proposed certain adjustments. Certain of these adjustments
are being contested through the IRS Appeals Office. Substantially all IRS audit issues for these years have been resolved. In addition, the Company is also subject to audits by state, local, and
foreign tax authorities. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted
with certainty. Should any issues addressed in the Company's tax audits be resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for
income tax in the period such resolution occurs. 


Cumulative Effects of Accounting Changes  


Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity  


On May 15, 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 150, 
Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity
. SFAS No. 150 requires issuers to classify as liabilities certain freestanding financial instruments that embody
obligations for the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 150 on June 29, 2003, which resulted in a favorable
cumulative effect type adjustment of approximately $3 million. This adjustment represented the mark-to-market adjustment to fair value for a forward purchase agreement
that allowed the Company to acquire 1.5 million shares of its common stock at a price of $16.64 per share. The Company settled this forward purchase agreement in August 2003. The
settlement resulted in an additional gain of approximately $6 million, which is included in interest and other income, net. 


Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations  


On September 29, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 143, 
Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations
, which
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. Net of the related
income tax effect of approximately $1 million, adoption of SFAS No. 143 resulted in an unfavorable cumulative-effect type adjustment to net income during 2003 of approximately
$2 million. This adjustment represents cumulative depreciation and accretion that would have been recognized through the date of adoption of SFAS No. 143 had the statement been applied
to the Company's existing asset retirement obligations at the time they were initially incurred. 


Recent Accounting Pronouncements  


In December 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission released Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, 
Revenue
Recognition
, which supercedes SAB 101, 
Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements
. SAB 104 clarifies existing
guidance regarding revenue contracts that contain multiple deliverables to make it consistent with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 00-21. The adoption of SAB 104 did
not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial position. 


41








 


In
December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. (FIN) 46R, a revision to FIN 46, 
Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities.
 FIN 46R clarifies some of the provisions of FIN 46 and exempts certain entities from its requirements. FIN 46R is effective at the end
of the first interim period ending after March 15, 2004. The adoption of FIN 46R did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial position. 


In
March 2004, the FASB issued EITF Issue No. 03-1, 
The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to
Certain Investments
. EITF 03-1 includes new guidance for evaluating and recording impairment losses on debt and equity investments, as well as new disclosure
requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired. In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position EITF 03-1-1, which delays the
effective date until additional guidance is issued for the application of the recognition and measurement provisions of EITF 03-1 to investments in securities that are impaired;
however, the disclosure requirements are effective for annual periods ending after June 15, 2004. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of EITF 03-1,
management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position. 


Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  


The Company currently measures compensation expense for its employee stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board
(APB) Opinion No. 25, 
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
 and provides pro forma disclosures of the effect on net income and earnings per
share as if the fair value-based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense. The Company has elected to follow APB Opinion No. 25 because, as further discussed in Part II,
Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the alternative fair value accounting provided for under SFAS No. 123, 
 
Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation
, requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options and
employee stock purchase plan shares. Under APB Opinion
No. 25, when the exercise price of the Company's employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant, no compensation expense is recognized. 


On
March 31, 2004, the FASB issued a proposed Statement, 
Share-Based Payment,
 that addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions
in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise's equity
instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. The proposed Statement would eliminate the ability to account for share-based compensation transactions using APB Opinion
No. 25 and generally would require instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. If adopted, it is currently anticipated that the proposed
Statement would be effective for the Company beginning in its fourth fiscal quarter of 2005. 


At
the Company's annual shareholders meeting on April 24, 2003, shareholders approved a proposal requesting that the Company's Board of Directors (the Board) establish a policy of expensing the
value of all future employee stock options issued by the Company. The Board and management appreciate and take seriously the views expressed by the Company's shareholders. The Company decided not to
expense the value of employee stock options until the FASB finalizes its new accounting standard on the matter, which may play a significant role in determining the fair value of and accounting for
employee stock options. The Company monitors progress at the FASB and other developments with respect to the general issue of employee stock compensation. The Company is currently reviewing the
potential impact from the guidance of the proposed statement, which may require the Company to recognize substantially more compensation expense in future periods that could have a material adverse
impact on the Company's future results of operations. The accounting impact had the Company chosen to apply the fair-value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, instead of the
recognition provisions under APB Opinion No. 25, is described in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

As
of September 25, 2004, the Company had $5.464 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, an increase of $898 million over the same balances at
the end of fiscal 2003. The principal components of this increase were cash generated by operating activities of $934 million and proceeds of $427 million from the issuance of common
stock under stock plans, partially offset by cash used to repay the Company's outstanding debt of $300 million and purchases of property, plant, and equipment of $176 million. The
Company's short-term investment portfolio is primarily invested in high credit quality, liquid investments. Approximately $3.2 billion of this cash, cash equivalents, and
short-term investments are held by the Company's foreign subsidiaries and would be subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. The Company is currently assessing the impact
of the one-time favorable foreign dividend provisions recently enacted as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and may decide to repatriate earnings from some of its foreign
subsidiaries. 


The
Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital expenditures, stock
repurchase activity, outstanding commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. 


Debt  


In February 2004, the Company retired $300 million of debt outstanding in the form of 6.5% unsecured notes. The notes were originally issued in 1994 and were sold
at 99.9925% of par for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. The Company currently has no long-term debt obligations. 


Capital Expenditures  


The Company's total capital expenditures were $176 million during fiscal 2004, $104 million of which were for retail store facilities and equipment related to the
Company's Retail segment and $72 million of which were primarily for corporate infrastructure, including information systems enhancements and operating facilities enhancements and expansions.
The Company currently anticipates it will utilize approximately $240 million for capital expenditures during 2005, approximately $125 million of which is
expected to be utilized for further expansion of the Company's Retail segment and the remainder utilized to support normal replacement of existing capital assets and enhancements to general
information technology infrastructure.

Stock Repurchase Plan  


In July 1999, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does
not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time. 


During
the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company entered into a forward purchase agreement to acquire 1.5 million shares of its common stock in September of 2003 at an average price of $16.64 per
share for a total cost of $25.5 million. In August 2003, the Company settled this agreement prior to its maturity, at which time the Company's common stock had a fair value of $22.81.
Other than this forward purchase transaction, the Company has not engaged in any transactions to repurchase its common stock since fiscal 2000. Since inception of the stock repurchase plan, the
Company had repurchased a total of 6.55 million shares at a cost of $217 million. The Company was still authorized to repurchase up to an additional $283 million of its common
stock as of September 25, 2004. 


Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations  


The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the Company has financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative
instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity
that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company.

Lease Commitments  


As of September 25, 2004, the Company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases of approximately $617 million, $436 million of
which related to the lease of retail space and related facilities. Remaining terms on the Company's existing operating leases range from 2 to 16 years. 


Purchase Obligations  


The Company utilizes several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company's products and to perform final assembly and test of finished
products. These contract manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods ranging from 30 to 130 days. The
Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of
purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments typically cover the Company's forecasted component and manufacturing requirements
for periods ranging from 30 to 130 days. The nature of the Company's outstanding third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments has not changed significantly since the
end of its fiscal 2003. As of September 25, 2004, the Company had 


44








 


outstanding
third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of approximately $1.1 billion. 


Asset Retirement Obligations  


The Company's asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. As of
September 25, 2004, the Company estimates that gross expected future cash flows of approximately $12 million would be required to fulfill these obligations. 


Other Obligations  


The Company's other obligations of approximately $24 million are primarily related to telecommunications services. 


Indemnifications  


The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party
intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of
an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted
against itself or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a
material adverse affect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. 


Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition  


Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company's operating results and financial condition, past financial performance should not be
considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. 


General economic conditions and current economic and political uncertainty could adversely affect the demand for the Company's products and the financial health of its
suppliers, distributors, and resellers.  


The Company's operating performance depends significantly on general economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad. Over the past several years, demand for the Company's products
has been negatively impacted by difficult global economic conditions. Additionally, some of the Company's education customers appeared to be delaying technology purchases due to concerns about the
overall impact of the weaker economy and state budget deficits on their available funding. Although recent macroeconomic trends seem to indicate an economic recovery, continued uncertainty about
future economic conditions makes it difficult to forecast future demand for the Company's products and related operating results. Should global and/or regional economic conditions deteriorate, demand
for the Company's products could be adversely affected, as could the financial health of its suppliers, distributors, and resellers. 


War, terrorism, public health issues or other business interruptions could disrupt supply, delivery or demand of products, which could negatively affect the Company's
operations and performance.  


War, terrorism, public health issues and other business interruptions whether in the U.S. or abroad, have caused and could continue to cause damage or disruption to
international commerce by creating economic and political uncertainties that may have a strong negative impact on the global economy, the Company, and the Company's suppliers or customers. The
Company's major business operations are subject to interruption by earthquake, fire, power shortages, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, medical conditions, and other events
beyond its control. The majority of the Company's research and development activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, including
certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are located near 


45








 


major
seismic faults. Because the Company does not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses, the Company's operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely
affected in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster. 


Although
it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events, such events could result in a decrease in demand for the Company's products, make it difficult or impossible to
deliver products to its customers or to receive components from its suppliers, and could create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply chain. In addition, should major public health issues,
including epidemics, arise the Company could be negatively impacted by the need for more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in the availability of freight services,
governmental actions limiting the movement of products between various regions, delays in production ramps of new products, and disruptions in the operations of the Company's manufacturing vendors and
component suppliers. The Company's operating results and financial condition have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by these events. 


The market for personal computers and related peripherals and services, as well as digital music devices and related services, is highly competitive. If the Company is unable
to effectively compete in these markets, its results of operations could be adversely affected.  


The personal computer industry is highly competitive and is characterized by aggressive pricing practices, downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new
products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by
competitors, price sensitivity on the part of consumers, and a large number of competitors. Over the past several years, price competition in the market for personal computers and related peripherals
has been particularly intense. The Company's competitors who sell Windows and Linux based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins in order to gain or maintain
market share in response to the weakness in demand that began in the second half of calendar 2000 for personal computing products. The Company's results of operations and financial condition have
been, and in the
future may continue to be, adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing pressures and downward pressures on gross margins. 


The
personal computer industry has also been characterized by rapid technological advances in software functionality, hardware performance, and features based on existing or emerging industry
standards. Further, as the personal computer industry and its customers place more reliance on the Internet, an increasing number of Internet devices that are smaller and simpler than traditional
personal computers may compete for market share with the Company's existing products. Several competitors of the Company have either targeted or announced their intention to target certain of the
Company's key market segments, including consumer, education, professional and consumer digital video editing, and design and publishing. Several of the Company's competitors have introduced or
announced plans to introduce digital music products and/or online stores offering digital music distribution that mimic many of the unique design, technical features, and solutions of the Company's
products. The Company has a significant number of competitors, many of whom have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, and technological resources, as well as broader product lines and larger
installed customer bases than those of the Company. Additionally, there has been a trend towards consolidation in the personal computer industry that has resulted in larger and potentially stronger
competitors in the Company's markets. 


The
Company is currently the only maker of hardware using the Mac OS. The Mac OS has a minority market share in the personal computer market, which is dominated by makers of computers utilizing
other competing operating systems, including Windows and Linux. The Company's future operating results and financial condition are substantially dependent on its ability to continue to develop
improvements to the Macintosh platform in order to maintain perceived design and functional advantages over competing platforms. 


46








 




The
Company is currently focused on market opportunities related to digital music distribution and related consumer electronic devices, including iPods. The Company faces increasing competition from
other companies promoting their own digital music products and distribution services and free peer-to-peer music services. These competitors include both new entrants with
novel market approaches, such as subscription services models, and also larger companies that may have greater technical, marketing, distribution and other resources than those of the Company, as well
as established hardware, software and music content supplier relationships. Failure to effectively compete could negatively affect the Company's operating results and financial position. There can be
no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that effectively compete in these markets or successfully distribute and sell digital music outside the U.S. The
Company may also have to respond to price competition by lowering prices and/or increasing features which could adversely affect the Company's music product gross margins as well as overall Company
gross margins. 


The
Company also faces increased competition in the U.S. education market. Sales in the U.S. to both elementary and secondary schools, as well as for college and university customers, remain a core
market for the Company. Uncertainty in this channel remains as several competitors of the Company have either targeted or announced their intention to target the education market for personal
computers, which could negatively affect the Company's market share. In an effort to regain market share and remain competitive, the Company has been and will continue to pursue
one-to-one (1:1) learning solutions in education. The Company's 1:1 learning solutions are a complete solution consisting of an iBook portable system for every student and
teacher along with a wireless network connected to a central server. These 1:1 learning solutions and other strategic sales are generally priced more aggressively and could result in significantly
less profitability or even in financial losses, particularly for larger deals. Although the Company believes it has taken certain steps to strengthen its position in the education market, there can be
no assurance that the Company will be able to increase or maintain its share of the education market or execute profitably on large strategic arrangements. Failure to do so may have an adverse impact
on the Company's operating results and financial condition. 


The Company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions in order to remain competitive and effectively stimulate customer demand.  


Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the personal computer and consumer electronics industries, which are characterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and
rapid technological advances, the Company must continually introduce new products and technologies, enhance existing products in order to remain competitive, and effectively stimulate customer demand
for new products and upgraded versions of the Company's existing products. The success of new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors, including market acceptance; the Company's
ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions, including production ramp issues; the availability of application software for new products; the effective management of inventory
levels in line with anticipated product demand; the availability of products in appropriate quantities to meet anticipated demand; and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in
the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect that new products will have on its sales or results of operations. 


The Company's products, from time to time, experience quality problems that can result in decreased net sales and operating profits.  


The Company sells highly complex hardware and software products that can contain defects in design and manufacture. Sophisticated operating system software and applications,
such as those sold by the Company, often contain "bugs" that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software. Defects may also occur in components and products the Company purchases from
third-parties. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware and software it sells. 


47








 


Failure
to do so could result in lost revenue, loss of reputation, and significant warranty and other expense to remedy. 


Because orders for components, and in some cases commitments to purchase components, must be placed in advance of customer orders, the Company faces substantial inventory risk.  


The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and products that have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value
and accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees of orders for inventories that have been cancelled. Although the Company believes its inventory and related provisions are adequate, given the
rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the computer and consumer electronics industries, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur additional inventory and related
charges. In addition, such charges have had, and may have, a material effect on the Company's financial position and results of operations. 


The
Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. Because the Company's markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes,
there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products. Consistent with industry practice, components
are normally acquired through a combination of formal purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments typically cover the
Company's forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 130 days. The Company's operating results and financial condition have been in the past and may in
the future be materially adversely affected by the Company's ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns. 


Future operating results are dependent upon the Company's ability to obtain a sufficient supply of components, including microprocessors, some of which are in short supply or
available only from limited sources.  


Although most components essential to the Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components including microprocessors and ASICs are
currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some key components (including without limitation DRAM, and TFT-LCD flat-panel displays), while currently
available to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide availability and pricing pressures. In addition, new products introduced by the Company often
initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. In situations where a
component or product utilizes new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until such time as the suppliers' yields have matured. The Company and other producers in the personal computer
industry also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. The Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the
personal computer industry including certain microprocessors and ASICs. Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of
components other than those customized to meet the Company's requirements. If the supply of a key component were to be delayed or constrained on a new or existing product, the Company's results of
operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 


The
Company's ability to produce and market competitive products is also dependent on the ability and desire of IBM and Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. (formerly the Semiconductor Products
Segment of Motorola, Inc.), the sole suppliers of the PowerPC RISC-based microprocessor for the Company's Macintosh computers, to provide the Company with a sufficient supply of
microprocessors with price/performance features that compare favorably to those supplied to the Company's competitors by Intel Corporation and other developers and producers of microprocessors used by
personal computers using other operating systems. Further, despite its efforts to educate the marketplace to the contrary, the Company believes that many of its current and potential customers believe
that the relatively slower MHz 


48








 




rating
or clock speed of the microprocessors it utilizes in its Macintosh systems compares unfavorably to those utilized by other operating systems and translates to slower overall system performance.
There have been instances in recent years where the inability of the Company's suppliers to provide advanced PowerPC microprocessors in sufficient quantity has had significant adverse effects on the
Company's results of operations. In addition, IBM is currently the Company's sole supplier of the PowerPC G5 processor, which is used in the Company's current Power Mac, Xserve, and iMac products.
Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. is the sole supplier of the G4 processor, which is used in the Company's eMac and portable products. IBM has recently experienced manufacturing problems with the
PowerPC G5 processor, which resulted in the Company delaying the shipment of various products and constrained certain product shipments during the second half of 2004. The inability of IBM to remedy
these problems in a timely manner, avoid manufacturing problems in the future, and to deliver to the Company microprocessors in sufficient quantities with competitive price/performance features could
further constrain shipments of products containing the G5 processor and could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition. 


The Company is dependent on manufacturing and logistics services provided by third parties, many of whom are located outside of the U.S.  


Most of the Company's products are manufactured in whole or in part by third-party manufacturers. In addition, the Company has outsourced much of its transportation and
logistics management. While outsourcing arrangements may lower the cost of operations, they also reduce the Company's direct control over production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such
diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of the products manufactured or services rendered, or the flexibility of the Company to respond to changing market conditions. Moreover,
although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain at least initially responsible to the ultimate consumer for warranty
service in the event of product defects. Any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise, could adversely affect the
Company's future operating results and financial condition. 


Final
assembly of products sold by the Company is currently conducted in the Company's manufacturing facility in Cork, Ireland, and by external vendors in Fremont, California, Fullerton, California,
Taiwan, Korea, the Netherlands, the People's Republic of China, and the Czech Republic. Currently, manufacture of many of the components used in the Company's products and final assembly of
substantially all of the Company's portable products including PowerBooks, iBooks, and the iPod is performed by third-party vendors in Taiwan and China. If for any reason manufacturing or logistics in
any of these locations is disrupted by events such as regional economic, business, environmental, medical, political, information technology system failures, or military actions, the Company's results
of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 


The Company's future operating performance is dependent on the performance of distributors and other resellers of the Company's products.  


The Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers and cataloguers, many of whom distribute products from competing
manufacturers. In addition, the Company also sells many of its products and resells certain third-party products in most of its major markets directly to end users, certain education customers, and
certain resellers through its online stores around the world and its retail stores. Many of the Company's significant resellers operate on narrow product margins and have been negatively affected by
recent economic conditions. Considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with the Company's distribution and retail channel partners. The
Company's business and financial results could be adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weaken, if resellers within consumer channels were to cease distribution of the
Company's products, or if uncertainty regarding demand for the Company's products caused resellers to 


49








 


reduce
their ordering and marketing of the Company's products. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in various programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected
resellers' stores with Company employees. These programs could require a substantial investment from the Company, while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue to offset this
investment. 


Over
the past several years, an increasing proportion of the Company's net sales have been made by the Company directly to end-users through its online stores around the world and through
its retail stores in the U.S. and Japan. Some of the Company's resellers have perceived this expansion of the Company's direct sales as conflicting with their own business and economic interests as
distributors and resellers of the Company's products. Perception of such a conflict could discourage the Company's resellers from investing additional resources in the distribution and sale of the
Company's products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of the Company's products. The Company's business and financial results could be adversely affected if expansion of its direct sales to
end-users causes some or all of its resellers to cease or limit distribution of the Company's products. 


Further
information regarding risks associated with Marketing and Distribution may be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading "Markets and Distribution." 


The Company relies on third-party music content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.  


The Company contracts with third parties to offer their music content to customers through the Company's iTunes Music Store. The Company pays substantial fees to obtain the
rights to offer to its customers this third-party music. Many of the Company's licensing arrangements with these third-party
content providers are short-term in nature and do not guarantee the future renewal of these arrangements at commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Certain parties in the music industry
have announced their intent to consolidate their music distribution operations, which could limit the availability and increase the fees required to offer music content to customers through the iTunes
Music Store. Further, some third-party content providers currently, or may in the future, offer music products and services that compete with the Company's music products and services, and could take
action to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license their music content in the future. If the Company is unable to continue to offer a wide variety of music content at reasonable
prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach outside the U.S., then sales and gross margins of the Company's iTunes Music Store as well as related hardware and
peripherals, including iPods, may be adversely affected. 


Third-party
content providers and artists require that the Company provide certain digital rights management solutions and other security mechanisms. If the requirements from content providers or
artists change, then the Company may be required to further develop or license technology to address such new rights and requirements. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to develop or
license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner, if at all, which could have a materially adverse effect on the Company's operating results and financial position. 


The Company's future performance is dependent upon support from third-party software developers. If third-party software applications cease to be developed or available for the
Company's hardware products, then customers may choose not to buy the Company's products.  


The Company believes that decisions by customers to purchase the Company's personal computers, as opposed to Windows-based systems, are often based on the availability of
third-party software for particular applications such as Microsoft Office. The Company also believes the availability of third-party application software for the Company's hardware products depends in
part on third-party developers' perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the Company's products versus software for the larger
Windows market. This analysis is based on factors such as the perceived strength of the Company and its products, the anticipated potential revenue that may be generated, continued acceptance by
customers of Mac OS X, and the costs of developing such 


50








 


software
products. To the extent the Company's financial losses in prior years and the minority market share held by the Company in the personal computer market, as well as the Company's decision to
end its Mac OS licensing program, have caused software developers to question the Company's prospects in the personal computer market, developers could be less inclined to develop new application
software or upgrade existing software for the Company's products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows market. Moreover, there can be
no assurance software developers will continue to develop software for Mac OS X, the Company's operating system, on a timely basis or at all. 


In
addition, past and future development by the Company of its own software applications and solutions may negatively impact the decision of software developers to develop, maintain, and upgrade
similar or competitive software for the Company's products. The Company currently markets and sells a variety of software applications for use by professionals, consumers, and education customers that
could influence the decisions of third-party software developers to develop or upgrade Macintosh-compatible software products. Software applications currently marketed by the Company include software
for professional film and video editing, professional compositing and visual effects for large format film and video productions, professional music production and music post production, professional
and consumer DVD encoding and authoring, consumer digital video and digital photo editing and management, digital music management, desktop-based database management, and high-quality
presentations. The Company also markets an integrated productivity application that incorporates word processing, page layout, image manipulation, spreadsheets, databases, and presentations in a
single application. 


In
August 1997, the Company and Microsoft Corporation entered into patent cross license and technology agreements. In addition, for a period of five years through August 2002, and
subject to certain limitations related to the number of Macintosh computers sold by the Company, Microsoft was required to make versions of its Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer products for the
Mac OS. Although Microsoft has released Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer for Mac OS X, Microsoft has not been obligated to produce future versions of its products subsequent to
August 2002. While the Company believes its relationship with Microsoft has been and will continue to be beneficial to the Company and to its efforts to increase the installed base for the Mac
OS, the Company does compete directly with Microsoft in a number of key areas. Accordingly, Microsoft's interest in producing application software for the Mac OS following expiration of the agreements
may be influenced by Microsoft's perception of its interests as the vendor of the Windows operating system and competing digital media applications, including music distribution service and
technology. In June of 2003, Microsoft stated that it would no longer develop new versions of Internet Explorer for the Mac OS, subsequent to the Company's introduction during 2003 of its own web
browser, Safari. Further discontinuance of products for the Macintosh platform, including Microsoft Office and other Microsoft products could have an adverse effect on the Company's net sales and
results of operations. 


The Company's business relies on access to patents and intellectual property obtained from third parties, and the Company's future results could be adversely affected if it is
alleged or found to have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others.  


Many of the Company's products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third-parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses
relating to various aspects of its products and business methods, the Company believes that based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially
reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available or available on acceptable terms. 


Because
of technological changes in the computer and consumer electronics industries, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible certain
components of the Company's products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents of others. The Company has from time to time been notified that it may be infringing certain patents
or other intellectual 


51








 




property
rights of others. Responding to such claims, regardless of their merit, can be time consuming, result in significant expenses, and cause the diversion of management and technical personnel.
Several pending claims are in various stages of evaluation. The Company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements in certain of these cases. However, no assurance can be
given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. In the event there is a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting the Company from marketing
or selling certain of its products or a successful claim of infringement against the Company requiring it to pay royalties to a third-party, the Company's future operating results and financial
condition could be adversely affected. Information regarding certain claims and litigation involving the Company related to alleged patent infringement and other matters is set forth in Part I,
Item 3 of this Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability for damages or royalties from any current legal proceedings or claims related
to the infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, or financial
condition. However, the results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of patent or other
intellectual property rights of others described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K or should several of these matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting
period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. 


The Company's retail initiative has required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and
uncertainties.  


Through September 2004, the Company has opened 86 retail stores. The Company's retail initiative has required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold
improvements, information systems, inventory, and personnel. The Company has also entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space with lease terms ranging from 5 to
16 years, the majority of which are for 10 years. The Company could incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate this initiative or close individual stores. Such costs could
adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a relatively high proportion of the Retail segment's costs are fixed because of depreciation on store
construction costs and lease expense. As a result, significant losses would result should the Retail segment experience a decline in sales for any reason. 


Certain
of the Company's stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues that function as vehicles for general corporate marketing, corporate events, and brand awareness. Because
of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment in equipment and leasehold improvements than the Company's more typical retail stores. The
Company has opened seven such stores through November 2004. Because of their location and size, these high
profile stores also require the Company to enter into substantially larger operating lease commitments compared to those required for its more typical stores. Current leases on such locations have
terms ranging from 10 to 16 years with total commitments per location over the lease terms ranging from $25 million to $50 million. Closure or poor performance of one of these
high profile stores could have a particularly significant negative impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. 


Many
of the general risks and uncertainties the Company faces could also have an adverse impact on its Retail segment. Also, many factors unique to retail operations present risks and uncertainties,
some of which are beyond the Company's control, that could adversely affect the Retail segment's future results, cause its actual results to differ from those currently expected, and/or have an
adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations. Potential risks and uncertainties unique to retail operations that could have an adverse impact on the Retail segment include, among
other things, macro-economic factors that have a negative impact on general retail activity; inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation; lack of consumer acceptance of
the Company's retail approach; failure to attract new users to the Macintosh platform; inability to sell third-party hardware and software products at adequate margins; failure to manage relationships
with existing retail channel partners; lack of experience

in
managing retail operations outside the U.S.; costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of Apple-branded and third-party retail inventory; and inability to obtain quality retail
locations at reasonable cost. 


Investment in new business strategies and initiatives could disrupt the Company's ongoing business and may present risks not originally contemplated.  


The Company may decide to invest in new business strategies or engage in acquisitions that complement the Company's strategic direction and product roadmap. Such endeavors may
involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management's attention away from normal business operations; insufficient revenue generation to offset liabilities assumed and
expenses associated with the strategy; and unidentified issues not discovered in the Company's due diligence process. Because these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that
such strategies and initiatives will be successful and will not materially adversely affect the Company's business, operating results or financial condition. 


Declines in the sales of the Company's professional products or increases in sales of consumer products, including iPods, may negatively impact the Company's gross margin and
operating margin percentages  


Unit sales of the Company's professional products, including Power Macintosh and PowerBook systems, generally have higher gross margins than the Company's consumer products,
including iMacs, iBooks, iPods, and content from the iTunes Music Store. A shift in sales mix away from higher margin
professional products towards lower margin consumer products could adversely affect the Company's future gross margin and operating margin percentages. The Company's traditional professional customers
may choose to buy consumer products, specifically the iMac G5 and iBook, instead of professional products. Professional users may choose to buy the iMac G5 due to its relative price performance, use
of the same PowerPC G5 processor used in the Company's Power Macs, and unique design featuring a flat panel screen. Potential PowerBook customers may also choose to purchase iBooks instead due to
their price performance and screen size. Additionally, significant future growth in iPod sales without corresponding growth in higher margin product sales could also reduce gross margin and operating
margin percentages. 


The
Company believes that weak economic conditions over the past several years are having a pronounced negative impact on its professional and creative customers who are significant users of its
professional systems. Also, it is likely that many of the Company's current and potential professional, creative, and small business customers, who are most likely to utilize professional systems,
believe that the relatively slower MHz rating or clock speed of the microprocessors the Company utilizes in its Macintosh systems compares unfavorably to those utilized by other computer manufacturers
and translates to slower overall system performance. These factors may result in an adverse impact to sales of the Company's professional products as well as to gross margin and operating margin
percentages. 


The Company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons.  


The Company's profit margins vary among its products and its distribution channels. The Company's direct sales, primarily through its retail and online stores, generally have
higher associated profitability than its indirect sales. Additionally, the Company's direct channels have traditionally had more sales of software and higher priced hardware products, which generally
have higher gross margins, than through its indirect channels. As a result, the Company's gross margin and operating margin percentages as well as overall profitability may be adversely impacted as a
result of a shift in product, geographic or channel mix. In addition, the Company generally sells more products during the third month of each quarter than it does during either of the first two
months, a pattern typical in the personal computer industry. This sales pattern can produce pressure on the Company's internal infrastructure during the third month of a quarter and may adversely
impact the Company's ability to predict its financial results accurately. Developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company's products, an
internal systems failure, or failure of one of the Company's key logistics, components suppliers, or manufacturing partners, can have significant adverse impacts on the Company and its results of
operations and financial condition. 


53








 


The Company has higher research and development and selling, general and administrative costs, as a percentage of revenue, than many of its competitors.  


The Company's ability to compete successfully and maintain attractive gross margins and revenue growth is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely
flow of innovative and competitive products and technologies to the marketplace. As a result, the Company incurs higher research and development costs as a percentage of revenue than its competitors
who sell personal computers based on other operating systems. Many of these competitors seek to compete aggressively on price and maintain very low cost structures. Further, as a result of the
expansion of the Company's Retail segment and costs associated with marketing the Company's brand including its unique operating system, the Company incurs higher selling costs as a percentage of
revenue than many of its competitors. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive gross margins, its results of operations may be materially
adversely affected by its operating cost structure. 


The Company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivables. This risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.  


The Company distributes its products through third-party computer resellers and retailers and directly to certain educational institutions and commercial customers. A
substantial majority of the Company's outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. The Company also has unsecured non-trade receivables from certain of
its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale by the Company of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the
Company. While the Company has procedures in place to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and non-trade receivables, there can be no assurance that such procedures will
be effective in limiting its credit risk and avoiding losses. Additionally, if the global economy and regional economies fail to improve or continue to deteriorate, it becomes more likely that the
Company will incur a material loss or losses as a result of the weakening financial condition of one or more of its customers or manufacturing vendors. 


The Company's success depends largely on its ability to attract and retain key personnel.  


Much of the future success of the Company depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, members of its
executive team, and those in technical, marketing and staff positions. Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense,
especially in the Silicon Valley, where the majority of the Company's key employees are located. The Company has relied on its ability to grant stock options as one mechanism for recruiting and
retaining this highly skilled talent. Potential accounting regulations requiring the expensing of stock options may impair the Company's future ability to provide these incentives without incurring
significant compensation costs. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel. 


The Company is subject to risks associated with the availability and cost of insurance.  


The Company has observed rapidly changing conditions in the insurance markets relating to nearly all areas of traditional commercial insurance. Such conditions have and may
continue to result in higher premium costs, higher policy deductibles, lower coverage limits and may also yield possible policy form exclusions. For some risks, because of cost and/or availability,
the Company does not have insurance coverage. Because the Company retains some portion of its insurable risks, and in some cases self insures completely, unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of
insured limits may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial position. 


Failure of information technology systems and breaches in the security of data upon which the Company relies could adversely affect the Company's future operating results.  


Information technology system failures and breaches of data security could disrupt the Company's ability to function in the normal course of business by potentially causing
delays or cancellation of customer 


54








 


orders,
impeding the manufacture or shipment of products, or resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer or Company information. Management has taken steps to address these concerns for its
own systems by implementing sophisticated network security and internal control measures. However, there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach of the Company or a
third-party vendor will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. 


The Company's business is subject to the risks of international operations.  


A large portion of the Company's revenue is derived from its international operations. As a result, the Company's operating results and financial condition could be
significantly affected by risks associated with international activities, including economic and labor conditions, political instability, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), and
changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the local currency in which the products are sold and goods and services are purchased. The Company's primary exposure to movements in foreign currency
exchange rates relate to non-dollar denominated sales in Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada, and certain parts of Asia and non-dollar denominated operating expenses incurred
throughout the world. Weaknesses in foreign currencies, particularly the Japanese Yen and the Euro, can adversely impact consumer demand for the Company's products and the U.S. dollar value of the
Company's foreign currency denominated sales. Conversely, strengthening in these and other foreign currencies can increase the cost to the Company of product components, negatively affecting the
Company's results of operations. 


Margins
on sales of the Company's products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency
exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties. 


Derivative
instruments, such as foreign exchange forward and option positions have been utilized by the Company to hedge exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such
hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates. 


Further
information related to the Company's global market risks may be found in Part II, Item 7A of this Form 10-K under the subheading "Foreign Currency Risk" and
may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Notes 1 and 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 


The Company is subject to risks associated with environmental regulations.  


Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the
requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and
regulations have recently been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including various European Union member countries, Japan and certain states within the U.S. In the future,
these laws could have a material adverse affect on the Company. 


Changes in accounting rules could adversely affect the Company's future operating results.  


Financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These principles are subject to interpretation by various governing bodies,
including the FASB and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), who interpret and create appropriate accounting regulations. A change from current accounting regulations, including accounting for
stock-based compensation, could have a significant effect on the Company's results of operations and could impact the manner in which the Company conducts business. 


55








 


Unanticipated changes in the Company's tax rates could affect its future results.  


The Company's future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax
rates, changes in the valuation of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation. In addition, the Company is subject to the continuous
examination of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to
determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on the Company's operating
results and financial condition. 


The Company's stock price may be volatile.  


The Company's stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between its actual and anticipated financial results and as a result of
announcements by the Company and its competitors. The stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that
have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These factors, including lack of positive performance in the Company's stock price, as well as general economic and political
conditions and investors' concerns regarding the credibility of corporate financial reporting and integrity of financial markets, may materially adversely affect the market price of the Company's
stock in the future. In addition, increases in the Company's stock price may result in greater dilution of earnings per share.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    
 


Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management  


The Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and its interest rate swap and option positions, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction
with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures. However, given the effective horizons of the Company's risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the
exposures, there can be no assurance the
hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains
and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and,
therefore, may adversely affect the Company's operating results and financial position. 


Interest Rate Risk  


While the Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world's leading industrialized countries, the Company's interest income and expense is most sensitive
to fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. In this regard, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and
short-term investments as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges. 


The
Company's short-term investment policy and strategy is to ensure the preservation of capital, meet liquidity requirements, and optimize return in light of current credit and interest
rate trends. The Company benchmarks its performance by utilizing external money managers to manage a small portion of the aggregate investment portfolio. The external managers adhere to the Company's
investment policies and also provide occasional research and market information that supplements internal research used to make credit decisions in the investment process. 


The
Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company's investment portfolio. The Company places its short-term investments in highly liquid
securities issued by high credit quality issuers and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company's general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure
the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk. All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents; highly liquid investments
with maturities greater than three months are classified as short-term investments. As of September 25, 2004, approximately $180 million of the Company's
short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. As of September 27, 2003, $629 million of the Company's investment portfolio classified as
short-term investments had maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remainder all had underlying maturities between 3 and 12 months. The Company may sell its investments
prior to their stated maturities, due to liquidity needs, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. As a result of such activity, the Company recognized net gains of
$1 million in 2004, $21 million in 2003, and $7 million in 2002. 


In
order to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company's investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that a
change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 25,
2004, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $14.4 million decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. As of
September 27, 2003, a similar 100 basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a $12.9 million decline in fair value. Such losses would only be
realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity. Except in instances noted above, the Company's policy is to hold investments to maturity. 


From
time to time, the Company has entered into interest rate derivative transactions with financial institutions in order to better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on
its cash equivalents 


57








 




and
short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on its debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the Company's exposure away from fluctuations in
short-term U.S. interest rates. The Company did not enter into any interest rate derivatives during 2004 or 2003 and had no open interest rate derivatives at September 25, 2004. 


In
prior years, the Company had entered into interest rate debt swaps with financial institutions. The interest rate debt swaps required the Company to pay a floating interest rate based on the three-
or six-month U.S. dollar LIBOR and receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of the underlying notional amounts. These swaps effectively converted the Company's
fixed-rate 10-year debt to floating-rate debt. Due to prevailing market interest rates, during 2001 and 2002 the Company entered into and then subsequently closed
out interest rate debt swap positions realizing gains of $23 million. The gains were deferred, recognized in long-term debt and were amortized to other income and expense over the
remaining life of the debt. 


Foreign Currency Risk  


In general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S.
dollar, may negatively affect the Company's net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is also a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to
competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. 


The
Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain
firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Generally, the Company's practice is to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign
exchange transaction exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, and
limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments. 


In
order to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company's foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis
using a value-at-risk (VAR) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate 3000
random market price paths. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company's foreign exchange portfolio due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR
model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The model assumes normal market conditions. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair
value of $3.2 million as of September 25, 2004 compared to a maximum one-day loss of $7.5 million as of September 27, 2003. Because the Company uses foreign
currency instruments for hedging purposes, losses incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures. 


Actual
gains and losses in the future associated with the Company's investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of
September 25, 2004 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and amount of interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates, and the Company's actual
exposures and positions.

Overview

During the last nine months of 1996, the Company experienced a 
significant decline in net sales, units shipped, and share of the personal 
computer market.  This decline in demand and the resulting losses, coupled 
with intense price competition throughout the industry, led to the 
Company's decision to implement a new strategic direction intended to 
improve the Company's competitiveness and restore its profitability.  The 
Company has initiated programs to develop and market products and 
services more selectively targeted to education, home, and business 
segments.  In moving in this new strategic direction, the Company expects 
to reduce the number of new product introductions and the number of 
products in certain categories within its current product portfolio.

Net Sales
Net sales trended downward beginning in the second quarter of 1996, 
decreasing $1,229 million, or 11%; $1,545 million, or 19%; and $682 
million, or 23%; during the twelve, nine, and three months ended 
September 27, 1996, respectively, compared with the same periods in 
1995, due to a decrease in net sales of Macintosh(registered trademark)
computers and of peripheral products such as displays and printers.  Total
Macintosh computer unit sales trended downward beginning in the second quarter
of 1996, decreasing 11%, 19%, and 26% during the twelve, nine, and three
months ended September 27, 1996, respectively, compared with the same 
periods in 1995. This decline in unit sales was a result of a decline or lack
of growth in worldwide demand for all product families, which the 
Company believes was due principally to customer concerns regarding the 
Company's strategic direction, financial condition, and future prospects, 
and due to delays in the shipment of certain PowerBook(registered trademark)
products as a result of quality problems.  In addition, unit sales of
peripheral products trended downward beginning in the second quarter of 1996,
decreasing 20%, 24%, and 30% during the twelve, nine and three months ended
September 27, 1996, respectively, compared with the same periods in 
1995, for the reasons noted above.  The average aggregate revenue per 
Macintosh unit increased slightly during the twelve and three months 
ended September 27, 1996, and decreased slightly during the nine months 
ended September 27, 1996, compared with the same periods in 1995, 
primarily due to a continued shift in product mix toward the Company's 
newer products and products with multimedia configurations, offset to 
varying degrees by pricing actions across all product lines in order to 

				12



stimulate demand.  The average aggregate revenue per peripheral product was
flat during the twelve, nine, and three months ended September 27, 1996
compared with the same periods in 1995.  The average revenue per Macintosh and
per peripheral unit will remain under significant downward pressure due to a
variety of factors, including industrywide pricing pressures and increased
competition. 

International net sales represented 52% of net sales in 1996 compared with 
48% of net sales in 1995.  International net sales trended downward 
beginning in the second quarter of 1996, decreasing 3%, 11% and 13% 
during the twelve, nine, and three months ended September 27, 1996, 
respectively, compared with the same periods in 1995.  Net sales in 
European markets trended downward beginning in the second quarter of 
1996, decreasing during the twelve, nine, and three months ended 
September 27, 1996 compared with the same periods in 1995, as a result of 
a decrease in Macintosh and peripheral unit sales, partially offset by an 
increase in the average aggregate revenue per Macintosh and per 
peripheral unit, primarily during the first part of the year.  Net sales in 
Japan trended downward beginning in the second quarter of 1996, 
decreasing during the twelve, nine, and three months ended September 27, 
1996 compared with the same periods in 1995.  An increase in Macintosh 
unit sales during these periods was more than offset by a decrease in the 
average aggregate revenue per Macintosh and per peripheral unit and a 
decrease in peripheral unit sales.  Domestic net sales trended downward 
beginning in the second quarter of 1996, decreasing by 18%, 26%, and 
30% for the twelve, nine, and three months ended September 27, 1996, 
respectively, compared with the corresponding periods in 1995, resulting 
from a decline or lack of growth in demand for all product families.

According to an industry source, in the fourth quarter of 1996 compared 
with the fourth quarter of 1995, the Company's share of the worldwide and 
U.S. personal computer markets declined to 5.4% from 8.7%, and to 7.3% 
from 13.2%, respectively. 

Net sales increased $1,873 million, or 20%, in 1995 over 1994, primarily 
due to a combination of unit growth, higher average selling prices, and 
changes in currency exchange rates.  Total Macintosh computer unit sales 
increased approximately 15% over the prior year.  This unit sales growth 
resulted principally from strong sales of the Company's Power 
Macintosh(registered trademark) products, which accounted for more than 70%
of total unit shipments during the fourth quarter of 1995, compared with 26%
in the comparable period of 1994, and from sales of newer product offerings 
within the Performa(registered trademark) family of desktop personal computers.
This unit growth was partially offset by declining unit sales of certain of the
Company's older product offerings.  The average aggregate revenue per 
Macintosh unit increased 12% in 1995 compared with 1994, primarily due 
to a shift in product mix toward the Company's newer products and 
products with multimedia configurations.

International net sales represented 48% of net sales in 1995 compared with 
46% of net sales in 1994.  International net sales grew 25% in 1995 from 
1994, primarily reflecting strong net sales growth in the Pacific region, 
particularly Japan.  Domestic net sales increased 16% in 1995 over 1994.

In general, the Company's resellers purchase products on an as-needed 
basis.  Resellers frequently change delivery schedules and order rates 
depending on changing market conditions.  Unfilled orders ('backlog') 
can be, and often are, canceled at will.  The Company attempts to fill 
orders on the requested delivery schedules.  However, products may be in 
relatively short supply from time to time until production volumes have 
reached a level sufficient to meet demand or if other production or 
fulfillment constraints exist.  The Company's backlog was approximately 
$563 million at November 29, 1996, and consisted primarily of the 
Company's PowerBook products, as well as higher-end Power Macintosh 
products.

In the Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any 
particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business 
prospects.  In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of or 
immediately following introduction of new products because of 
overordering by dealers anticipating shortages.  Backlog often is reduced 
once dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply.  
Because of the foregoing, as well as other factors affecting the Company's 
backlog, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the 
Company's future revenue or financial performance. 

The Company believes that net sales will remain below the level of the 
prior year's comparable periods through at least the first quarter of 1997, if
not later.  In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company will be 
able to achieve sales levels in the first quarter of 1997 comparable to the 
levels achieved in the fourth quarter of 1996.

Gross Margin 

Gross margin represents the difference between the Company's net sales 
and its cost of goods sold.  The amount of revenue generated by the sale of 
products is influenced principally by the price set by the Company for its 
products relative to competitive products.  The cost of goods sold is based 
primarily on the cost of components and, to a lesser extent, direct labor 
costs.  The type and cost of components included in particular 
configurations of the Company's products (such as memory and disk 
drives) are often directly related to the need to market products in 
configurations competitive with those of other manufacturers.  
Competition in the personal computer industry is intense, and in the short 
term, frequent changes in pricing and product configuration are often 
necessary in order to remain competitive.  Accordingly, gross margin as a 
percentage of net sales can be significantly influenced in the short term by 
actions undertaken by the Company in response to industrywide 
competitive pressures.

Gross margin decreased to 9.8% in 1996 compared with 25.8% in 1995.  
This decrease is primarily the result of a $616 million charge in the second 
quarter of 1996 for the write-down of certain inventory, as well as the 
costs to cancel excess component orders, necessitated by significantly 
lower than expected demand for many of the Company's products, 
primarily its entry-level products.  Also, the Company separately incurred 
approximately $145 million in charges during the last nine months of 1996 
to provide for the estimated costs to correct certain quality problems in 
certain entry-level, Performa, PowerBook and peripheral products, 
covering both goods held in inventory and shipped goods.  The Company 
also incurred greater warranty expenses per unit sold during 1996 
compared with 1995.  In addition, this decrease in gross margins is due to 
the Company's response to extreme competitive actions by other 
companies attempting to gain market share, including the Company's 
pricing actions in the United States, Japan and Europe across most product 
lines, which were partially offset by a decrease in the cost of certain 
product components.  In the first quarter of 1997, the Company took, and 
the Company expects that it will continue to take, similar pricing actions 
with respect to a number of product lines.

The decrease in gross margin levels was slightly offset by hedging gains, 
net of the effects of a stronger U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign 
currencies.  The Company's operating and pricing strategies take into 
account changes in exchange rates over time; however, the Company's 
results of operations can be significantly affected in the short term by 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.   

Gross margin increased both in amount and as a percentage of net sales in 
1995 compared with 1994.  The increase in gross margin as a percentage 
of net sales was primarily a result of a shift in product mix toward the 
Company's newer, high-margin products, which included strong sales of 
certain products within the Company's Power Macintosh family of 
personal computers and its Macintosh Performa family.  The increase in 
gross margin levels was affected favorably by changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates as a result of a weaker U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign
currencies in 1995 compared with 1994. 

Although gross margin for 1996 was 9.8%, it improved to 22.0% during 
the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of lower component costs, sales of 
fully reserved product, and a shift in product mix toward the Company's 
newer products and products with multimedia configurations, which tend 
to have higher margins.  There can be no assurance that the Company will 
be able to sustain the gross margin level achieved in the fourth quarter.  
Gross margins will remain under significant downward pressure due to a 
variety of factors, including continued industrywide pricing pressures, 
increased competition, and compressed product life cycles.  Gross margins 
could also be affected by the Company's ability to effectively manage 
quality problems and warranty costs, and to stimulate demand for certain 
of its products.

Research and development expenditures decreased slightly in 1996 when 
compared with 1995, primarily due to the termination of certain third-party 
joint development efforts.  The increase as a percentage of net sales 
resulted from a decrease in the level of net sales. The increase in research 
and development expenditures during 1995 compared with 1994 reflected 
higher project- and headcount-related spending.  The decrease as a 
percentage of net sales was the result of revenue growth in 1995 over 
1994.

				14



The Company believes that continued investments in research and 
development are critical to its future growth and competitive position in 
the marketplace and are directly related to continued, timely development 
of new and enhanced products.  The Company believes that research and 
development expenditures in 1997 will be comparable to those in 1996.

Selling, general and administrative expenses remained relatively flat, but 
increased as a percentage of net sales, in 1996 compared with 1995.  The 
increase as a percentage of net sales in 1996 when compared with 1995 
was the result of reduced net sales.  In 1995, selling, general and 
administrative expenses increased as a result of increased advertising and 
channel marketing programs.  The decrease as a percentage of net sales 
was primarily the result of the sales growth in 1995 over 1994.

As a result of its restructuring plan, the Company expects that selling, 
general and administrative expenditures in 1997 will decrease compared 
with 1996 levels.

Interest and other
income(expense), net	$ 88      NM 	$(10)    55% 	$(22)    

     					

Interest and other income (expense), net, increased to $88 million in 
income in 1996 from $10 million in expense in 1995.  This $98 million 
favorable change is primarily composed of a favorable variance of $78 
million related to net realized and unrealized foreign exchange hedging 
gains, and lower foreign exchange hedging costs, primarily as a result of 
lower market and option volatility, higher U.S. interest rates compared 
with rates abroad, and reduced foreign currency cash flows; an increase of 
$73 million related to realized gains on the sale of most of the Company's 
available-for-sale and other equity securities during 1996; offset by a $52 
million unfavorable variance related to interest income (expense), as a 
result of higher average debt balances and lower average cash balances 
during the year, and an overall decline in average interest rate yields. In
addition, the Company's cost of funds has increased as a result of the 
downgrading from January 1996 through May 1996 of its short-term debt 
to NP and C by Moody's Investor Services and Standard and Poor's Rating 
Agency, respectively, and of its long-term debt to B1 and B+ by Moody's 
Investor Services and Standard and Poor's Rating Agency, respectively.

In 1995, interest and other income (expense), net, decreased to $10 million 
in expense from $22 million in expense in 1994.  This $12 million 
favorable change was primarily composed of $49 million in interest 
income (expense) attributable to higher average cash balances, higher 
interest rates, and interest rate hedging gains, offset in part by a $36 
million unfavorable variance related to realized and unrealized foreign 
exchange hedging losses and foreign exchange hedging costs.  Market 
volatility and higher foreign currency balances accounted for the increased 
hedging costs.  

For a summary of the Company's interest and other income (expense), net,

At September 27, 1996, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from 
deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $487 
million before being offset against certain deferred tax liabilities for 
presentation on the Company's balance sheet.  A substantial portion of this 
asset is realizable based on the ability to offset existing deferred tax 
liabilities. Realization of approximately $85 million of the asset is 
dependent on the Company's ability to generate approximately $245 
million of future U.S. taxable income.  Management believes that it is 
more likely than not that the asset will be realized based on forecasted U.S.
income.   However, there can be no assurance that the Company will meet 
its expectations of future U.S. income.  As a result, the amount of the 
deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in the near and 
long term if estimates of future taxable U.S. income are reduced.  Such an 
occurrence could materially adversely affect the Company's financial 
results and condition.  The Company will continue to evaluate the 
realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for a 
valuation allowance.  For additional information regarding income taxes, 
refer to pages 40 - 41 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition

The Company's future operating results and financial condition are 
dependent on the Company's ability to successfully develop, manufacture, 
and market technologically innovative products in order to meet dynamic 
customer demand patterns.  Inherent in this process are a number of factors 
that the Company must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable 
future operating results and financial condition.  Potential risks and 
uncertainties that could affect the Company's future operating results and 
financial condition include, without limitation, continued competitive 
pressures in the marketplace and the effect of any reaction by the 
Company to such competitive pressures, including pricing actions by the 
Company; the ability of the Company to make timely delivery to the 
marketplace of successful technological innovations; the effects of 
significant adverse publicity; the Company's ability to supply products in 
certain categories; and uncertainties concerning the Company's ability to 
successfully implement its new strategic direction and restructuring 
actions.

The Company expects that it will not return to sustained profitability until 
at least the second quarter of 1997, if not later.

Restructuring of Operations

During 1996, the Company began to implement certain restructuring 
actions aimed at reducing its cost structure, improving its competitiveness, 
and restoring sustained profitability.  There are several risks inherent in the
Company's efforts to transition to a new cost structure.  These include the 
risk that the Company will not be able to reduce expenditures quickly 
enough to restore sustained profitability and the risk that cost-cutting 
initiatives will impair the Company's ability to innovate and remain 
competitive in the computer industry.  

As part of its restructuring effort, the Company has begun to implement a 
new business model. Implementation of the new business model involves 
several risks, including the risk that by simplifying its product line the 
Company will increase its dependence on fewer products, potentially 
reduce overall sales, and increase its reliance on unproven products and 
technology. Another risk of the new business model is that by increasing 
the proportion of the Company's products to be manufactured under 
outsourcing arrangements, the Company could lose control of the quality 
or quantity of the products manufactured, or lose the flexibility to make 
timely changes in production schedules in order to respond to changing 
market conditions. In addition, the new business model could adversely 
affect employee morale, thereby damaging the Company's ability to retain 
and motivate employees. Also, because the new business model contemplates that
the Company will rely to a greater extent on collaboration and licensing
arrangements with third parties, the Company will have less direct control
over certain of its research and development efforts, and its ability to create
innovative new products may be reduced. Finally, even if the new business model
is successfully implemented, there can be no assurance that it will effectively
resolve the various issues currently facing the Company. In addition,
although the Company believes that the actions it is taking under its
restructuring plan should help restore marketplace confidence in the
Macintosh platform, there can be no assurance that such actions will be
successful.
				16



For the foregoing reasons there can be no assurance that the current 
restructuring actions will achieve their goals or that similar actions will not
be required in the future.  The Company's future operating results and 
financial condition could be adversely affected should it encounter 
difficulty in effectively managing the transition to the new business model 
and cost structure.

For more information regarding the Company's restructuring actions 
initiated in the second quarter of 1996, refer to page 39 of the 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Product Introductions and Transitions 

Due to the highly volatile nature of the personal computer industry, which 
is characterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid 
technological advances, the Company frequently introduces new products 
and product enhancements.  The success of new product introductions is 
dependent on a number of factors, including market acceptance, the 
Company's ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions, 
the availability of application software for new products, the effective 
management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, 
the availability of products in appropriate quantities to meet anticipated 
demand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects 
in the early stages of introduction.  Accordingly, the Company cannot 
determine the ultimate effect that new products will have on its sales or 
results of operations.  In addition, although the number of new product 
introductions may decrease under the Company's new business model, the 
risks and uncertainties associated with new product introductions may 
increase as the Company refocuses its product offerings on key growth 
segments.

The rate of product shipments immediately following introduction of a 
new product is not necessarily an indication of the future rate of shipments 
for that product, which depends on many factors, some of which are not 
under the control of the Company.  These factors may include initial large 
purchases by a small segment of the user population that tends to purchase 
new technology prior to its acceptance by the majority of users ("early 
adopters"); purchases in satisfaction of pent-up demand by users who 
anticipated new technology and, as a result, deferred purchases of other 
products; and overordering by dealers who anticipate shortages due to the 
aforementioned factors.  These factors may be offset by others, such as the 
deferral of purchases by many users until new technology is accepted as 
"proven" and for which commonly used software products are available; 
and the reduction of orders by dealers once they believe they can obtain 
sufficient supply of products previously in backlog. 

Backlog is often volatile after new product introductions due to the 
aforementioned demand factors, often increasing coincident with 
introduction, and then decreasing once dealers and customers believe they 
can obtain sufficient supply of the new products. 

The measurement of demand for newly introduced products is further 
complicated by the availability of different product configurations, which 
may include various types of built-in peripherals and software.  
Configurations may also require certain localization (such as language) for 
various markets and, as a result, demand in different geographic areas may 
be a function of the availability of third-party software in those localized 
versions.  For example, the availability of European-language versions of 
software products manufactured by U.S. producers may lag behind the 
availability of U.S. versions by a quarter or more. This may result in lower 
initial demand for the Company's new products outside the United States, 
even though localized versions of the Company's products may be 
available.

The increasing integration of functions and complexity of operations of the 
Company's products also increase the risk that latent defects or other faults
could be discovered by customers or end-users after volumes of products 
have been produced or shipped.  If such defects were significant, the 
Company could incur material recall and replacement costs under product 
warranties.

				17



Competition

The personal computer industry is highly competitive and is characterized 
by aggressive pricing practices, downward pressure on gross margins, 
frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, continual 
improvement in product price/performance characteristics, price sensitivity 
on the part of consumers, and a large number of competitors.  During 
1996, the Company's results of operations and financial condition were, 
and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by industrywide 
pricing pressures and downward pressures on gross margins.  The industry 
has also been characterized by rapid technological advances in software 
functionality and hardware performance and features based on existing or 
emerging industry standards.  Many of the Company's competitors have 
greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, and technological resources; 
broader product lines; and larger installed customer bases than those of the 
Company.

The Company's future operating results and financial condition may be 
affected by overall demand for personal computers and general customer 
preferences for one platform over another or one set of product features 
over another.

The Company is currently the primary maker of hardware that uses the 
Macintosh operating system ("Mac(registered trademark) OS").  The Mac OS has a
minority market share in the personal computer market, which is dominated by 
makers of computers that run the MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows 
operating systems.  The Company believes that the Mac OS, with its 
perceived advantages over MS-DOS and Windows, has been a driving 
force behind sales of the Company's personal computer hardware for the 
past several years.  Recent innovations in the Windows platform, including 
those introduced by Windows 95, have added features to the Windows 
platform similar to those offered by the Mac OS.  The Company is 
currently taking and will continue to take steps to respond to the 
competitive pressures being placed on its personal computer sales as a 
result of the recent innovations in the Windows platform.  The Company's 
future operating results and financial condition may be affected by its 
ability to maintain and increase the installed base for the Macintosh 
platform.  The Company recently announced a new strategy with respect to 
updating its operating system while redesigning its plan for a next-
generation operating system.  To extend the life of its current operating 
system, the Company intends to issue periodic releases consisting of 
discrete operating system components.  The Company expects that this 
will enable it to introduce some new functionality for the current operating 
system sooner than it would be able to introduce a completely new 
operating system.  Concurrently, the Company will continue development 
of its next-generation operating system, focusing on increased 
functionality at the possible expense of some backward compatibility.  
Diminished backward compatibility in its new operating system could 
result in a loss of existing customers.  Inability to introduce a next-
generation operating system on a timely basis, or to gain developer support 
and market accepatance for it, may have an adverse impact on the 
Company's operating results and financial condition.  

As part of its efforts to increase the installed base for the Macintosh 
platform, the Company announced the licensing of the Mac OS to other 
personal computer vendors in January 1995, as well as an additional 
licensing initiative in 1996.   Several vendors currently sell products that 
utilize the Macintosh operating system.  The Company believes that 
licensing the operating system will result in a broader installed base on 
which software vendors can develop and provide technical innovations for 
the Macintosh platform.  However, there can be no assurance that the 
installed base will be broadened by the licensing of the operating system or 
that licensing will result in an increase in the number of application 
software titles or the rate at which vendors will bring to market application
software based on the Mac OS.  In addition, as a result of licensing its 
operating system, the Company is forced to compete with other companies 
producing Mac OS-based computer systems.  The benefits to the Company 
from licensing the Mac OS to third parties may be more than offset by the 
disadvantages of being required to compete with them.

As a supplemental means of addressing the competition from MS-DOS 
and Windows, the Company has devoted substantial resources toward 
developing personal computer products capable of running application 
software designed for the MS-DOS or Windows operating systems 
("Cross-Platform Products"). These products include the RISC-based 
PowerPC(trademark) microprocessor and either include the Pentium or 586-class
microprocessor or can accommodate an add-on card containing a Pentium 
or 586-class microprocessor.  These products enable users to run 
concurrently applications that require the Mac OS, MS-DOS, Windows 
3.1, or Windows 95 operating systems. 

Depending on customer demand, the Company may supply customers who 
purchase Cross-Platform Products with Windows operating system 
software under licensing agreements with Microsoft.  However, in order to 
do so, the Company will need to enter into one or more agreements with 
certain Microsoft distributors.  

				18



The Company, International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM") and 
Motorola, Inc. have agreed upon and announced the availability of 
specifications for a PowerPC microprocessor-based hardware reference 
platform.  These specifications define a "unified" personal computer 
architecture that gives access to both the Power Macintosh platform and 
the PC environment.  The Company's future operating results and financial 
condition may be affected by its ability to continue to implement this 
agreement and to manage the risk associated with the transition to this new 
hardware reference platform. 

Decisions by customers to purchase the Company's personal computers, as 
opposed to MS-DOS or Windows-based systems, are often based on the 
availability of third-party software for particular applications.  The 
Company believes that the availability of third-party application software 
for the Company's hardware products depends in part on third-party 
developers' perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, 
maintaining, and upgrading such software for the Company's products 
versus software for the larger MS-DOS and Windows market.  This 
analysis is based on factors such as the perceived strength of the Company 
and its products, the anticipated potential revenue that may be generated, 
and the costs of developing such software products.  To the extent the 
Company's recent financial losses and declining demand for the 
Company's product have caused software developers to question the 
Company's position in the personal computer market, developers could be 
less inclined to develop new application software or upgrade existing 
software for the Company's products and more inclined to devote their 
resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger MS-DOS 
and Windows market.  Microsoft Corporation is an important developer of 
application software for the Company's products.  Accordingly, 
Microsoft's interest in producing application software for the Company's 
products may be influenced by Microsoft's perception of its interests as the 
vendor of the Windows operating systems. 

The Company's ability to produce and market competitive products is also 
dependent on the ability of IBM and Motorola, Inc., the suppliers of the 
PowerPC RISC microprocessor for certain of the Company's products, to 
supply to the Company in adequate numbers microprocessors that produce 
superior price/performance results compared with those supplied to the 
Company's competitors by Intel Corporation, the developer and producer 
of the microprocessors used by most personal computers using the MS-
DOS and Windows operating systems.  IBM produces personal computers 
based on Intel microprocessors as well as workstations based on the 
PowerPC microprocessor, and is also the developer of OS/2, a competing 
operating system to the Company's Mac OS.  Accordingly, IBM's interest 
in supplying the Company with  microprocessors for the Company's 
products may be influenced by IBM's perception of its interests as a 
competing manufacturer of personal computers and as a competing 
operating system vendor.  

Several competitors of the Company, including Compaq, IBM, and 
Microsoft, have either targeted or announced their intention to target 
certain of the Company's key market segments, including education and 
publishing.  Many of these companies have greater financial, marketing, 
manufacturing, and technological resources than the Company.

The Company is integrating Internet capabilities into its new and existing 
hardware and software platforms.  There can be no assurance that the 
Company will be able to continue to do so successfully.  In addition, the 
Internet market is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an increasing 
number of market entrants who have introduced or developed products 
addressing access to, authoring for, or communication over, the Internet.  
Many of these competitors have a significant lead over the Company in 
developing products for the Internet, have significantly greater financial, 
marketing, manufacturing, and technological resources than the Company, 
or both.

The Company's future operating results and financial condition may also 
be affected by the Company's ability to successfully expand and capitalize 
on its investments in other markets, such as the markets for MessagePad
(registered trademark) and related products. 


				19



Global Market Risks 

A large portion of the Company's revenue is derived from its international 
operations.  As a result, the Company's operations and financial results 
could be significantly affected by international factors, such as changes in 
foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the 
foreign markets in which the Company distributes its products.  When the 
U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, the U.S. dollar value of 
non-U.S. dollar-based sales decreases.  When the U.S. dollar weakens, the 
U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based sales increases. 
Correspondingly, the U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based costs 
increases when the U.S. dollar weakens and decreases when the U.S. dollar 
strengthens.  Overall, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other 
than the U.S. dollar and, as such, benefits from a weaker dollar and is 
adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies 
worldwide.  Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a 
strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may negatively affect the Company's 
consolidated sales and gross margins (as expressed in U.S. dollars). 

To mitigate the short-term impact of fluctuating currency exchange rates 
on the Company's non-U.S. dollar-based sales, product procurement, and 
operating expenses, the Company regularly hedges its non-U.S. dollar-
based exposures.  Specifically, the Company enters into foreign exchange 
forward and option contracts to hedge firmly committed transactions.  
Currently, hedges of firmly committed transactions do not extend beyond 
one year.  The Company also purchases foreign exchange option contracts 
to hedge certain other probable but not firmly committed transactions.  
Hedges of probable but not firmly committed transactions currently do not 
extend beyond one year.  To reduce the costs associated with these 
ongoing foreign exchange hedging programs, the Company also regularly 
sells foreign exchange option contracts and enters into certain other 
foreign exchange transactions.  All foreign exchange forward and option 
contracts not accounted for as hedges, including all transactions intended 
to reduce the costs associated with the Company's foreign exchange 
hedging programs, are carried at fair value and are adjusted on each 
balance sheet date for changes in exchange rates.  

While the Company is exposed with respect to fluctuations in the interest 
rates of many of the world's leading industrialized countries, the 
Company's interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in 
the general level of U.S. interest rates.  In this regard, changes in U.S. 
interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company's cash, cash 
equivalents, and short-term investments as well as interest paid on its notes 
payable to banks and long-term debt.  To mitigate the impact of 
fluctuations in U.S. interest rates, the Company has entered into interest 
rate swap, collar, and floor transactions.  Certain of these transactions are 
intended to better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its 
cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments with the fixed-rate 
interest expense on its long-term debt.  The Company also enters into these 
transactions in order to diversify a portion of the Company's exposure 
away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates.  These instruments 
may extend the Company's cash investment horizon up to a maximum 
duration of three years.

To ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's foreign 
exchange and interest rate hedge positions, as well as to monitor the risks 
and opportunities of the nonhedge portfolios, the Company continually 
monitors its foreign exchange forward and option positions, and its interest 
rate swap, option and floor positions both on a stand-alone basis and in 
conjunction with its underlying foreign currency- and interest rate-related 
exposures, respectively, from both an accounting and an economic 
perspective.  However, given the effective horizons of the Company's risk 
management activities, there can be no assurance that the aforementioned 
programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact 
resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or 
interest rates.  In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of 
gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any given 
period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the 
underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the 
Company's operating results and financial position.  The Company 
generally does not engage in leveraged hedging. 

The Company's current financial condition may have an impact on the 
costs of its hedging transactions, as well as the willingness of its financial
counter-parties to enter into hedging transactions with the Company.

Inventory and Supply

In line with the Company's efforts to redesign its business model, the 
Company is taking steps to streamline its product portfolios in its key 
usage areas in education, business, and the home.  This planned 
simplification of product lines has resulted in inventory reserves.   
Cancelation fees related to custom component inventory purchased for 
anticipated product introductions that have been canceled have also been 
paid or accrued.  The Company has also separately provided for the 
estimated cost to correct certain quality problems in certain entry-level, 
Performa, PowerBook, and peripheral products.  Although the Company 
believes its inventory and related reserves are adequate, no assurance can 
be given that the Company will not incur additional inventory and related 
charges.

				20



The Company must order components for its products and build inventory 
well in advance of product shipments.  Because the Company's markets are 
volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk 
that the Company will forecast incorrectly and produce excess or 
insufficient inventories of particular products.  The Company's operating 
results and financial condition have been and may in the future be 
materially adversely affected by the Company's ability to manage its 
inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in customer demand 
patterns.  

Certain of the Company's products are manufactured in whole or in part by 
third-party manufacturers, either pursuant to design specifications of the 
Company or otherwise.  As a result of the Company's restructuring actions, 
which include the sale of the Company's Fountain, Colorado, 
manufacturing facility to SCI Systems, Inc. ("SCI") and a related 
manufacturing outsourcing agreement with SCI, the proportion of the 
Company's products produced and distributed under outsourcing 
arrangements will increase.  While outsourcing arrangements may lower 
the fixed cost of operations, they will also reduce the direct control the 
Company has over production.  It is uncertain what effect such diminished 
control will have on the quality or quantity of the products manufactured, 
or the flexibility of the Company to respond to changing market 
conditions. Furthermore, any efforts by the Company to manage its 
inventory under outsourcing arrangements could subject the Company to 
liquidated damages or cancelation of the arrangement.  

Moreover, although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain 
provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company remains at 
least initially responsible to the ultimate consumer for warranty service.  
Accordingly, in the event of product defects or warranty liability, the 
Company may remain primarily liable.  Any unanticipated product defect 
or warranty liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with contract 
manufacturers or otherwise, could adversely affect the Company's future 
operating results and financial condition.

The Company's ability to satisfy demand for its products may be limited 
by the availability of key components.  The Company has experienced 
some limitations in supply of certain microprocessors in the first quarter of 
1996.  The Company believes that the availability from suppliers to the 
personal computer industry of microprocessors and ASICs presents the 
most significant potential for constraining the Company's ability to 
produce products.  Specific microprocessors manufactured by IBM and 
Motorola, Inc. are currently available only from single sources, while some 
advanced microprocessors are currently in the early stages of ramp-up for 
production and thus have limited availability.  The Company and other 
producers in the personal computer industry also compete for other 
semiconductor products with other industries that have experienced 
increased demand for such products, due to either increased consumer 
demand or increased use of semiconductors in their products (such as the 
cellular phone and automotive industries).  Finally, the Company uses 
some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer 
industry (including certain microprocessors and ASICs).  Continued 
availability of these components may be affected if producers were to 
decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of 
components customized to meet the Company's requirements.  Such 
product supply constraints and corresponding increased costs could 
decrease the Company's net sales and adversely affect the Company's 
operating results and financial condition.

Marketing and Distribution

A number of uncertainties may affect the marketing and distribution of the 
Company's products.  Currently, the Company's primary means of 
distribution is through third-party computer resellers. Such resellers 
include consumer channels such as mass-merchandise stores, consumer 
electronics outlets, and computer superstores.  The Company's business 
and financial results could be adversely affected if the financial condition 
of these resellers weakened or if resellers within consumer channels were 
to decide not to continue to distribute the Company's products.

Uncertainty over demand for the Company's products may cause resellers 
to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company's products.  Under 
the Company's arrangements with its resellers, resellers have the option to 
reduce or eliminate unfilled orders previously placed, in most instances 
without financial penalty.  Resellers also have the option to return products 
to the Company without penalty within certain limits, beyond which they 
may be assessed fees.  The Company has recently experienced a reduction 
in ordering from historical levels by resellers due to uncertainty 
concerning the Company's condition and prospects.

Other Factors

The majority of the Company's research and development activities, its 
corporate headquarters, and other critical business operations, including 
certain major vendors, are located near major seismic faults. The 
Company's operating results and financial condition could be materially 
adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake.

Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may 
subject the Company to environmental and other regulations which 
include, in some instances, the requirement that the Company provide 
consumers with the ability to return to the Company product at the end of 
its useful life, and leave responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or
recycling with the Company.  It is unclear what effect such regulation will 
have on the Company's future operating results and financial condition.

The Company is currently in the process of replacing its existing 
transaction systems (which include order management, product 
procurement, distribution, and finance) with a single integrated system as 
part of its ongoing effort to increase operational efficiency.  The 
Company's future operating results and financial condition could be 
adversely affected if the Company is unable to implement and effectively 
manage the transition to this new integrated system.  

As part of the Company's restructuring plan, the Company sold its Napa, 
California, data center to MCI Systemhouse ("MCI"), and entered into a 
data processing outsourcing agreement with MCI.  While this outsourcing 
agreement may lower the Company's fixed costs of operations, it will also 
reduce the direct control the Company has over its data processing.  It is 
uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the Company's 
data processing.

Because of the foregoing factors, as well as other factors affecting the 
Company's operating results and financial condition, past financial 
performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future 
performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate 
results or trends in future periods.  In addition, the Company's 
participation in a highly dynamic industry often results in significant 
volatility of the Company's common stock price.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company's financial position with respect to cash, cash equivalents, 
and short-term investments, net of notes payable to banks, increased to 
$1,559 million at September 27, 1996, from $491 million at September 29, 
1995.  The Company's financial position with respect to cash, cash 
equivalents, and short-term investments increased to $1,745 million at 
September 27, 1996, from $952 million at September 29, 1995.    The 
Company's cash and cash equivalent balance at September 27, 1996, 
includes $177 million pledged as collateral to support letters of credit 
primarily associated with the Company's purchase commitments under the 
terms of the sale of the Company's Fountain, Colorado, manufacturing 
facility to SCI.  The Company's cash and cash equivalent balance at 
September 29, 1995, includes $90 million pledged as collateral to support 
notes payable to banks. 

Cash generated by operations during 1996 totaled $519 million.  Cash 
generated by operations was primarily the result of decreases in 
inventories and accounts receivable, partially offset by decreases in 
accounts payable and deferred tax liabilities.  As part of the Company's 
restructuring plan and in order to meet certain liquidity requirements 
during 1996, the Company generated $145 million of cash from the sale of 
certain equity investments, and the sale of the Fountain, Colorado, 
manufacturing facility to SCI and the Napa, California, data center to MCI.  
The Company expects that cash generated from the sale of equity 
investments and property, plant and equipment will be significantly less in 
1997 compared with 1996.  Net cash used for the purchase of property, 
plant, and equipment totaled $67 million in 1996, and consisted primarily 
of increases in manufacturing machinery and equipment.  The Company 
expects that the level of capital expenditures in 1997 will be comparable to 
1996.

Notes payable to banks at September 27, 1996, were approximately $275 
million lower than at September 29, 1995.  During 1996, an outstanding 
loan to Apple Computer B.V., a subsidiary of the Company, was repaid in 
full.  At September 27, 1996, Apple Japan, Inc., a subsidiary of the 
Company, held $186 million of notes payable to several banks, with 
maturity dates ranging from the end of December 1996 to May 1997.  The 
majority of these loans are guaranteed by the Company.

The Company's balance of long-term debt increased during 1996 due to the 
issuance of $661 million aggregate principal amount of 6% unsecured 
convertible subordinated notes to certain qualified parties in a private 
placement.  These notes were sold at 100% of par.  These notes pay 
interest semi-annually and mature on June 1, 2001.  The remainder of 
long-term borrowings consists of $300 million aggregate principal amount 
of 6.5% unsecured notes issued under an omnibus shelf registration 
statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1994.  
The notes were sold at 99.925% of par, for an effective yield to maturity of 
6.51%.  The notes pay interest semi-annually and mature on February 15, 
2004.  For more information regarding the Company's long-term debt, 
refer to pages XX-XX of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Internal Revenue Service has proposed federal income tax deficiencies 
for the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company has made certain 
prepayments thereon.  The Company contested the proposed deficiencies 
for the years 1984 through 1988, and most of the issues in dispute for these 
years have been resolved.  On June 29, 1995, the IRS issued a notice of 
deficiency proposing increases to the amount of the Company's federal 
income taxes for the years 1989 through 1991.  The Company has filed a 
petition with the United States Tax Court to contest these alleged tax 
deficiencies.  Management believes that adequate provision has been made 
for any adjustments that may result from these tax examinations. 

The Company's cost of funds has increased as a result of the downgrading 
from January 1996 through May 1996 of its short-term debt to NP and C 
by Moody's Investor Services and Standard and Poor's Rating Agency, 
respectively, and of its long-term debt to B1 and B+ by Moody's Investor 
Services and Standard and Poor's Rating Agency, respectively.  In 
addition, the Company may be required to pledge additional collateral with 
respect to certain of its borrowings and letters of credit and to agree to 
more stringent covenants than in the past.  The Company believes that its 
balances of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, together 
with continued short-term borrowings from banks, will be sufficient to 
meet its operating and other cash requirements, including the impact of 
planned restructuring actions, on a short- and long-term basis.  No 
assurance can be given that short-term borrowings from banks can be 
continued, or that any additional required financing could be obtained 
should the restructuring plan take longer to implement than anticipated or 
be unsuccessful.  If the Company is unable to obtain such financing, its 
liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially 
adversely affected.
