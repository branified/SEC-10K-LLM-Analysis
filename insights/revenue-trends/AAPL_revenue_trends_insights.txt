NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 


Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 
 


Apple Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively Apple or the Company) design,
manufacture, and market personal computers, portable digital music players, and mobile communication devices and sell a variety of related software, services, peripherals, and networking solutions. The Company sells its products worldwide through
its online stores, its retail stores, its direct sales force, and third-party wholesalers, resellers, and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Mac, iPod and iPhone compatible products including application
software, printers, storage devices, speakers, headphones, and various other accessories and supplies through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to consumer, small and mid-sized business (SMB), education, enterprise,
government, and creative customers. 
 
Basis of Presentation and Preparation 
 
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
materially from those estimates. Certain prior year amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 
 
The Companys fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Companys first quarter of fiscal years 2008 and 2007 contained 13 weeks and the first quarter of fiscal
year 2006 contained 14 weeks. The Companys fiscal years 2008 and 2007 ended on September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007, respectively, included 52 weeks, while fiscal year 2006 ended on September 30, 2006 included 53 weeks.
Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years or quarters refer to the Companys fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters of those fiscal years. 
 
Financial Instruments 
 
Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments 
 
All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. Highly liquid investments with
maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase are classified as short-term investments. The Companys debt and marketable equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. Management determines the
appropriate classification of its investments in debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates the available-for-sale designations as of each balance sheet date. These securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and
losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of shareholders equity. The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method. 
 
Derivative Financial Instruments 
 
The Company accounts for its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at
fair value. Derivatives that are not defined as hedges in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, 
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,
 as amended, must be adjusted to fair value
through earnings. 
 
For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges,
the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the
hedged transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in current earnings. To receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes
to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments that hedge
the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that are designated as fair value hedges, the net

gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in
earnings in the current period. The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure of the net investment in a foreign operation is reported in
the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For forward contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of
effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this component are recognized in current earnings. 
 
Inventories 
 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out method, or market. If the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value,
provisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. The Companys inventories consist primarily of finished goods for all periods presented. 
 
Property, Plant, and Equipment 
 
Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use of
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, up to 5 years for equipment, and the shorter of lease terms or 10 years for
leasehold improvements. The Company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 5 years. Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $363 million, $249 million, and $180 million during 2008, 2007, and 2006
respectively. 
 
Asset Retirement Obligations 
 
The
Company records obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs in accordance with SFAS No. 143, 
Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations
. The Company reviews legal
obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. If it is determined that a legal obligation exists, the fair value of the liability for an
asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying
amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. The difference between the gross expected future cash flow and its present value is accreted over the life of the related lease as an operating expense. All of the Companys existing asset
retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. The Companys asset retirement liability was $21 million and $18 million as of
September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007, respectively. 
 
Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets

 
The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment in accordance with SFAS
No. 144, 
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of.
 Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset
may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are
considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. The Company did not record any material impairments during 2008, 2007, and 2006.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 


Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 
 
 


SFAS No. 142, 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but rather be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. The Company performs its goodwill impairment tests on or
about August 31 of each year. The Company did not recognize any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in 2008, 2007, or 2006. The Company established reporting units based on its current reporting structure. For purposes of testing
goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit. 
 
SFAS No. 142 also
requires that intangible assets with definite lives be amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144. The Company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with definite
lives over periods ranging from 1 to 10 years. 
 
Foreign Currency Translation 
 
The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its international non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenue and expenses
for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are credited or charged to foreign currency translation included in accumulated other comprehensive income
in shareholders equity. The Companys foreign manufacturing subsidiaries and certain other international subsidiaries that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in
effect at the end of each period, and inventories, property, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. Gains and losses from these translations were insignificant and have been included in the Companys results of operations.

 
Revenue Recognition 
 
Net sales consist primarily of
revenue from the sale of hardware, software, music products, digital content, peripherals, and service and support contracts. For any product within these groups that either is software, or is considered software-related in accordance with the
guidance in Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 03-5, 
Applicability of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2 to Non-Software Deliverables in an Arrangement Containing More-Than-Incidental Software
 (e.g., Mac computers, iPod
portable digital music players and iPhones), the Company accounts for such products in accordance with the revenue recognition provisions of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position
(SOP) No. 97-2, 
Software Revenue Recognition
, as amended. The Company applies Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, 
Revenue Recognition,
 for products that are not software or software-related, such
as digital content sold on the iTunes Store and certain Mac, iPod and iPhone supplies and accessories. 
 
The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been
transferred. For most of the Companys product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers
revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed not
to be, fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met. 
 
Revenue from service and support contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the service coverage periods. These contracts typically include extended phone support, repair services, web-based support resources,
diagnostic tools, and extend the service coverage offered under the Companys one-year limited warranty.

The Company sells software and peripheral products obtained from other companies. The Company generally establishes
its own pricing and retains related inventory risk, is the primary obligor in sales transactions with its customers, and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. Accordingly, the Company generally recognizes revenue for the sale
of products obtained from other companies based on the gross amount billed. 
 
The Company accounts for multiple element arrangements that consist only of
software or software-related products in accordance with SOP No. 97-2. If a multiple-element arrangement includes deliverables that are neither software nor software-related, the Company applies EITF No. 00-21, 
Revenue Arrangements with
Multiple Deliverables,
 to determine if those deliverables constitute separate units of accounting from the SOP No. 97-2 deliverables. If the Company can separate the deliverables, the Company applies SOP No. 97-2 to the software and
software-related deliverables and applies other appropriate guidance (e.g., SAB No. 104) to the deliverables outside the scope of SOP No. 97-2. Revenue on arrangements that include multiple elements such as hardware, software, and services
is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element. Each elements allocated revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met. Fair value is generally determined by vendor
specific objective evidence (VSOE), which is based on the price charged when each element is sold separately. If the Company cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in a multiple-element
arrangement, the Company defers revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been performed, or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements. When the fair value of a delivered element has not
been established, the Company uses the residual method to recognize revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements is determinable. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of
the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue. 
 
The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated
commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. The estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue in
the period the Company has sold the product and committed to a plan. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Companys historical experience. Revenue is recorded net of taxes collected
from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority. 
 
Generally, the Company does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales or the sale of extended warranty and support contracts. When the Company does offer
specified upgrade rights, the Company defers revenue for the fair value of the specified upgrade right until the future obligation is fulfilled or when the right to the specified upgrade expires. Additionally, a limited number of the Companys
software products are available with maintenance agreements that grant customers rights to unspecified future upgrades over the maintenance term on a when and if available basis. Revenue associated with such maintenance is recognized ratably over
the maintenance term. 
 
In 2007, the Company began shipping Apple TV and iPhone. For Apple TV and iPhone, the Company indicated it may from time-to-time
provide future unspecified features and additional software products free of charge to customers. Accordingly, Apple TV and iPhone handsets sales are accounted for under subscription accounting in accordance with SOP No. 97-2. As such, the
Companys policy is to defer the associated revenue and cost of goods sold at the time of sale, and recognize both on a straight-line basis over the currently estimated 24-month economic life of these products, with any loss recognized at the
time of sale. Costs incurred by the Company for engineering, sales, marketing and warranty are expensed as incurred.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
 
The Company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. The Company considers historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of the
Companys customers, current economic conditions, and other factors that may affect customers ability to pay. 
 
Shipping Costs 


For all periods presented, amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue, and the Companys shipping and handling costs
are included in cost of sales. 
 
Warranty Expense 
 
The
Company generally provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. The Company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based
on actual experience and changes in future estimates. For products accounted for under subscription accounting pursuant to SOP No. 97-2, the Company recognizes warranty expense as incurred. 
 
Software Development Costs 
 
Research and development costs are
expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a products technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is
available for general release to customers pursuant to SFAS No. 86, 
Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed
. In most instances, the Companys products are released soon after technological feasibility has been
established. Therefore, costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally most software development costs have been expensed. 
 
During 2008, the Company capitalized $11 million of costs associated with the development of Mac OS X Version 10.6 Snow Leopard. In 2007, the Company determined that both
Mac OS X Version 10.5 Leopard (Mac OS X Leopard) and iPhone achieved technological feasibility. During 2007, the Company capitalized $75 million of costs associated with the development of Leopard and iPhone. In accordance with SFAS
No. 86, the capitalized costs related to Mac OS X Leopard and iPhone are amortized to cost of sales commencing when each respective product begins shipping and are recognized on a straight-line basis over a 3 year estimated useful life of the
underlying technology.
 
Total amortization related to capitalized software development costs was $27 million, $13 million, and $18 million in 2008, 2007, and
2006, respectively. 
 
Advertising Costs 
 
Advertising
costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $486 million, $467 million, and $338 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. 
 
Stock-Based Compensation 
 
The Company applies SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), 
Share-Based Payment
, for stock-based payment
transactions in which the Company receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by
the issuance of such equity instruments. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) option-pricing model to determine the fair-value of stock-based awards under SFAS No. 123R. 
 
SFAS No. 123R prohibits recognition of a deferred tax asset for an excess tax benefit that has not been realized. The Company will recognize a benefit from
stock-based compensation in equity if an incremental tax benefit is

realized by following the ordering provisions of the tax law. In addition, the Company accounts for the indirect effects of stock-based compensation on the
research tax credit, the foreign tax credit, and the domestic manufacturing deduction through the income statement. 
 
Further information regarding
stock-based compensation can be found in Note 6, Shareholders Equity, and Note 7, Stock-Based Compensation. 
 
Income Taxes

 
In accordance with SFAS No. 109, 
Accounting for Income Taxes
, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability
method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a
valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. 
 
During 2008, the Company adopted the
Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Financial Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, 
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109
. FIN 48 changes the accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes by creating a new framework for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose uncertain tax positions in their financial statements. Under FIN 48, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an
uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such
positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. FIN 48 also provides guidance on the reversal of previously recognized tax positions, balance sheet classifications,
accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. See Note 5, Income Taxes for additional information, including the effects of adoption on the Companys Consolidated Financial
Statements. 
 
Earnings Per Common Share 
 
Basic earnings
per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to
common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities
had been issued. Potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options, shares to be purchased under the employee stock purchase plan, and unvested restricted stock units (RSUs). The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive
securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the Companys common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from
potentially dilutive securities.

been antidilutive. 
 
Comprehensive Income 
 
Comprehensive
income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains, and losses that under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of
shareholders equity but are excluded from net income. The Companys other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized
gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges. 
 
Segment Information 
 
The Company reports segment information based on the management approach. The
management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Companys reportable segments. Information about the Companys products, major customers, and
geographic areas on a company-wide basis is also disclosed.

The Companys U.S. Corporate Securities consist primarily of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, time
deposits, and corporate debt securities. Foreign Securities consist primarily of foreign commercial paper issued by foreign companies, and certificates of deposit and time deposits with foreign institutions, most of which are denominated in U.S.
dollars. As of September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007, approximately $2.4 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, of the Companys short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from one to five years. The remaining
short-term investments had maturities less than 12 months. The Company had $117 million in net unrealized losses on its investment portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities ranging from one to five years, as of
September 27, 2008, and net unrealized losses of approximately $11 million on its investment portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities from one to five years, as of September 29, 2007. The Company may sell its
investments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. The Company recognized no material net gains or losses during 2008, 2007 and 2006 related to such sales.

The unrealized losses on the Companys investments in U.S. Treasury and Agency Securities, U.S. Corporate
Securities, and Foreign Securities were caused primarily by changes in interest rates, specifically, widening credit spreads. The Companys investment policy requires investments to be rated single-A or better with the objective of minimizing
the potential risk of principal loss. Therefore, the Company considers the declines to be temporary in nature. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating the investments for
other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, and the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment
for a period of time, which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value. During 2008, the Company did not record any material impairment charges on its outstanding securities. As of September 27, 2008, the Company does not
consider any of its investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired. 
 
Accounts Receivable 
 
Trade Receivables 
 
The Company distributes its products through
third-party distributors and resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and commercial customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk
on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Australia and by arranging with third-party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the
Companys direct customers. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of
these arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables not covered by collateral, third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Companys distribution and retail channel partners. Trade receivables from
two of the Companys customers accounted for 15% and 10% of trade receivables as of September 27, 2008, while one customer accounted for approximately 11% of trade receivables as of September 29, 2007.

Vendor Non-Trade Receivables 
 
The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final
products for the Company. The Company purchases these raw material components directly from suppliers. These non-trade receivables, which are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in other current assets, totaled $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion
as of September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007, respectively. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in net sales and does not recognize any profits on these sales until the related products are sold by the Company, at
which time the profit is recognized as a reduction of cost of sales. 
 
Derivative Financial Instruments 
 
The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange risk. Foreign currency forward and option contracts are used to offset the
foreign exchange risk on certain existing assets and liabilities and to hedge the foreign exchange risk on expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales. The Companys accounting policies for these instruments are
based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. 
 
The following table shows the notional principal, net fair value, and credit risk amounts of the Companys foreign currency instruments as of September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007 (in millions):

The notional principal amounts for derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding
as of year-end, and do not represent the amount of the Companys exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts shown in the table above represents the Companys gross exposure to potential accounting loss on these transactions
if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency exchange rates at each respective date. The Companys exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a function of
currency exchange rates.

Note 2Financial Instruments (Continued) 
 
 


The estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models and prevailing financial market
information as of September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007. Although the table above reflects the notional principal, fair value, and credit risk amounts of the Companys foreign exchange instruments, it does not reflect the gains or
losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the foreign exchange instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying
exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. 
 
Foreign Exchange Risk Management 
 
The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risk associated with existing
assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Generally, the Companys practice is to hedge some portion of its material foreign exchange exposures.
However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to, immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, or limited availability of appropriate
hedging instruments. 
 
To help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Companys U.S. dollar
functional subsidiaries hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and the Companys non-U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries selling in local currencies hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the
subsidiaries functional currency. Other comprehensive income associated with hedges of foreign currency revenue is recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related sales are recognized, and other comprehensive income
related to inventory purchases is recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Typically, the Company hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and
inventory purchases for three to six months. 
 
Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the
forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent 2 month time period. Deferred gains and losses in other comprehensive income associated with such derivative instruments are immediately
reclassified into earnings in other income and expense. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are also reflected in current earnings unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. The Company has not
recognized any material net gains during 2008, 2007 and 2006, related to the loss of a hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges. As of September 27, 2008, the Company had a net deferred gain associated with cash flow hedges of
approximately $19 million, net of taxes, substantially all of which is expected to be reclassified to earnings by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2009. 
 
The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument designated as a net investment hedge is included in the cumulative translation adjustment account of accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders
equity. For the years ended September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007, the Company had a net loss on net investment hedges of $12.2 million and $2.6 million, respectively, included in the cumulative translation adjustment. 
 
The Company may also enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain
assets and liabilities recorded in non-functional currencies. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in current earnings in other income and expense as offsets to the changes in the fair value of the related assets or
liabilities. Due to currency market movements, changes in option time value can lead to increased volatility in other income and expense.

In June 2008, the Company completed an acquisition of a business for total cash consideration, net of cash
acquired, of $220 million, of which $169 million has been allocated to goodwill, $51 million to deferred tax assets and $7 million to acquired intangible assets. 
 
The Companys goodwill is allocated primarily to the Americas reportable operating segment. Amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets was $46 million, $35 million, and $12 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006,
respectively. As of September 27, 2008, and September 29, 2007, the remaining weighted-average amortization period for acquired technology was 7.0 years and 7.1 years, respectively. 
 
Expected annual amortization expense related to acquired technology as of September 27, 2008, is as follows (in millions):

The foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pretax earnings of $3.5 billion, $2.2 billion, and $1.5
billion in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. As of September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007, $11.3 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively, of the Companys cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were held by foreign
subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. The Companys consolidated financial statements provide for
any related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated, aside from undistributed earnings of certain of the Companys foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the U.S. U.S. income taxes
have not been provided on a cumulative total of $3.8 billion of such earnings. It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that might be incurred if these earnings were to be distributed. 
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits, and the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled.

generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets.

The Companys income taxes payable have been reduced by the tax benefits from employee stock options and
employee stock purchase plan. The Company receives an income tax benefit calculated as the difference between the fair market value of the stock issued at the time of the exercise and the option price, tax effected. The net tax benefits
from employee stock option transactions were $770 million, $398 million, and $419 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, and were reflected as an increase to common stock in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity.

 
On October 3, 2008, the Tax Extenders and Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008 was signed into law. This bill, among other things, retroactively
extended the expired research and development tax credit. As a result, the Company expects to record a tax benefit of approximately $42 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 to account for the retroactive effects of the research credit
extension.

FIN 48 
 
In
the first quarter of 2008, the Company adopted FIN 48. Upon adoption of FIN 48, the Companys cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulted in an increase to retained earnings of $11 million. The Company had historically
classified interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits as current liabilities. Beginning with the adoption of FIN 48, the Company classifies gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in
payment or receipt of cash within one year as non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of the date of adoption of FIN 48 was $475 million, of which $209 million, if
recognized, would affect the Companys effective tax rate. As of September 27, 2008, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $506 million, of which $253 million, if recognized, would affect the Companys effective tax
rate. The Companys total gross unrecognized tax benefits are classified as non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
The aggregate
changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for the fiscal year ended September 27, 2008, is as follows (in millions):

The Companys policy to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the
provision for income taxes did not change as a result of adopting FIN 48. As of the date of adoption, the Company had accrued $203 million for the gross interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits. As of September 27, 2008, the
total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $219 million, which is classified as non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In 2008, the Company recognized interest expense in connection with tax matters of $16 million.

 
The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. For U.S.
federal income tax purposes, all years prior to 2002 are closed. The years 2002-2003 have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) and disputed issues have been taken to administrative appeals. The IRS is currently
examining the 2004-2006 years. In addition, the Company is also subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities. In major states and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 1988 and 2000, respectively, generally
remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities. 
 
Management believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments
that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Companys tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the
Company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs. Although timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, the Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that its
unrecognized tax benefits would materially change in the next 12 months.

Note 6Shareholders Equity 
 
 


Preferred Stock 
 
The Company has five million shares of authorized preferred stock, none of which is issued or outstanding. Under the terms of the Companys Restated Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors is authorized to determine or alter
the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the Companys authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock. 
 
CEO Restricted Stock
Award 
 
On March 19, 2003, the Companys Board of Directors granted 10 million shares of restricted stock to the Companys CEO
that vested on March 19, 2006. The amount of the restricted stock award expensed by the Company was based on the closing market price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant and was amortized ratably on a straight-line basis
over the three-year requisite service period. Upon vesting during 2006, the 10 million shares of restricted stock had a fair value of $646.6 million and had grant-date fair value of $7.48 per share. The restricted stock award was net-share
settled such that the Company withheld shares with value equivalent to the CEOs minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares
withheld of 4.6 million were based on the value of the restricted stock award on the vesting date as determined by the Companys closing stock price of $64.66. The remaining shares net of those withheld were delivered to the Companys
CEO. Total payments for the CEOs tax obligations to the taxing authorities was $296 million in 2006 and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The net-share settlement had the effect of
share repurchases by the Company as it reduced and retired the number of shares outstanding and did not represent an expense to the Company. The Companys CEO has no remaining shares of restricted stock. For the year ended September 30,
2006, compensation expense related to restricted stock was $4.6 million. 
 
Comprehensive Income 
 
Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains, and losses that
under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders equity but are excluded from net income. The Companys other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from
those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as
cash flow hedges. 
 
The following table summarizes the components of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of taxes, as of the three fiscal years ended

respectively.

Employee Benefit Plans 
 
2003 Employee Stock Plan

 
The 2003 Employee Stock Plan (the 2003 Plan) is a shareholder approved plan that provides for broad-based grants to employees,
including executive officers. Based on the terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 2003 Plan generally expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based on continued
employment, with either annual or quarterly vesting. The 2003 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, stock purchase rights and performance-based awards. As of
September 27, 2008, approximately 50.3 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2003 Plan. 
 
1997 Employee Stock Option
Plan 
 
In August 1997, the Companys Board of Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 1997 Plan), a
non-shareholder approved plan for grants of stock options to employees who are not officers of the Company. Based on the terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 1997 Plan generally expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and
generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based on continued employment, with either annual or quarterly vesting. In October 2003, the Company terminated the 1997 Plan and no new options can be granted from this plan. 
 
1997 Director Stock Option Plan 
 
In
August 1997, the Companys Board of Directors adopted a Director Stock Option Plan (the Director Plan) for non-employee directors of the Company, which was approved by shareholders in 1998. Pursuant to the Director Plan, the
Companys non-employee directors are granted an option to acquire 30,000 shares of common stock upon their initial election to the Board (Initial Options

). The Initial Options vest and become
exercisable in three equal annual installments on each of the first through third anniversaries of the grant date. On the fourth anniversary of a non-employee directors initial election to the Board and on each subsequent anniversary
thereafter, the director will be entitled to receive an option to acquire 10,000 shares of common stock (Annual Options). Annual Options are fully vested and immediately exercisable on their date of grant. Options granted under the
Director Plan expire 10 years after the grant date. As of September 27, 2008, approximately 290,000 shares were reserved for future issuance under the Director Plan. 
 
 
Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans 
 
The following executive officers, Timothy D. Cook, Peter Oppenheimer, Philip W.
Schiller, and Bertrand Serlet, have entered into trading plans pursuant to Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), as of November 1, 2008. A trading plan is a written document that

pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Companys
stock including the exercise and sale of employee stock options and shares acquired pursuant to the Companys employee stock purchase plan and upon vesting of RSUs. 
 
Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
 
The Company has a shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan (the
Purchase Plan), under which substantially all employees may purchase common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values as of the beginning and end of six-month offering periods. Stock
purchases under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of an employees compensation, up to a maximum of $25,000 in any calendar year. The number of shares authorized to be purchased in any calendar year is limited to a total of 3 million
shares. As of September 27, 2008, approximately 6.2 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan. 
 
Employee
Savings Plan 
 
The Company has an employee savings plan (the Savings Plan) qualifying as a deferred salary arrangement under
Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the Savings Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the IRS annual contribution limit ($15,500 for calendar year 2008). The Company matches 50%
to 100% of each employees contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employees eligible earnings. The Companys matching contributions to the Savings Plan were $50 million, $39 million, and $33 million
in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

Aggregate intrinsic value represents the value of the Companys closing stock price on the last trading day of
the fiscal period in excess of the exercise price multiplied by the number of options outstanding or exercisable. Total intrinsic value of options at time of exercise was $2.0 billion, $1.3 billion, and $1.2 billion for 2008, 2007, and 2006,
respectively. 
 
Shares of RSUs granted after April 2005 have been deducted from the shares available for grant under the Companys stock option plans
utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. Similarly shares of RSUs granted after April 2005, that are subsequently cancelled have been added back to the shares available for grant under the Companys stock option plans
utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs cancelled.

Upon vesting, the RSUs are generally net share-settled to cover the required withholding tax and the remaining
amount is converted into an equivalent number of shares of common stock. The majority of RSUs vested in 2008, 2007 and 2006, were net-share settled such that the Company withheld shares with value equivalent to the employees minimum statutory
obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 857,000, 20,000, and 986,000 for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, which was
based on the value of the RSUs on their vesting date as determined by the Companys closing stock price. Total payments for the employees tax obligations to the taxing authorities were $124 million, $3 million, and $59 million in 2008,
2007, and 2006, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These net-share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the Company as they reduced and retired the number of
shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting and did not represent an expense to the Company. 
 
The Company recognized $516
million, $242 million and $163 million of stock-based compensation expense in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense capitalized as software development costs was not significant as of September 27, 2008 or
September 29, 2007. The income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation expense was $169 million, $81 million, and $39 million for the years ended September 27, 2008, September 29, 2007, and September 30, 2006,
respectively. The total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options and RSUs expected to vest was $1.4 billion and $631 million as of September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007, respectively. The total unrecognized compensation
cost as of September 27, 2008, is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.92 years.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 


Note 7Stock-Based Compensation 
 
 


SFAS No. 123R requires the use of a valuation model to calculate the fair value of stock-based awards. The
Company uses the BSM option-pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock-based awards. The BSM option-pricing model incorporates various assumptions including expected volatility, expected life, and interest rates. The expected
volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Companys common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Companys stock options and other relevant factors including implied volatility
in market traded options on the Companys common stock. The Company bases its expected life assumption on its historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards it grants to employees. Stock-based compensation cost is
estimated at the grant date based on the awards fair-value as calculated by the BSM option-pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. 
 
The compensation expense incurred by the Company for RSUs is based on the closing market price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant and is amortized
ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. 
 
The weighted-average assumptions used for the three fiscal years ended
September 27, 2008, and the resulting estimates of weighted-average fair value per share of options granted and of employee stock purchase plan rights during those periods are as follows:

Note 8Commitments and Contingencies 
 
Lease Commitments 
 
The Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable
operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any other off-balance sheet financing arrangements. The major facility leases are generally for terms of 3 to 20 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of 1 to 5
additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms of 5 to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of September 27, 2008, the Companys total future minimum lease payments
under noncancelable operating leases were $1.8 billion, of which $1.4 billion related to leases for retail space.

Accrued Warranty and Indemnifications 
 
The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period for hardware products is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. The Company also
offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the Companys hardware products. The Company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product warranties at the time related
revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical and projected warranty claim rates,
historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Companys typical experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as
necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates. For products accounted for under subscription accounting pursuant to SOP No. 97-2, the Company recognizes warranty expense as incurred. 
 
The Company periodically provides updates to its applications and system software to maintain the softwares compliance with published specifications. The estimated
cost to develop such updates is accounted for as warranty costs that are recognized at the time related software revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units
delivered, the number of updates expected to occur, and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates.

The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal
claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of
an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party.

However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified
third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results.
Therefore, the Company did not record a liability for infringement costs as of either September 27, 2008 or September 29, 2007. 
 
Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product 
 
Although most components essential to the Companys
business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components including, but not limited to microprocessors, enclosures, certain liquid crystal displays (LCDs), certain optical drives, and application-specific integrated
circuits (ASICs) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources, which subjects the Company to significant supply and pricing risks. Many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources
including, but not limited to NAND flash memory, dynamic random access memory (DRAM), and certain LCDs, are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. In addition, the Company has entered
into certain agreements for the supply of key components including, but not limited to microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs at favorable pricing, but there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these
agreements on similar favorable terms, or at all, upon expiration or otherwise obtain favorable pricing in the future. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and/or price increases that can have a material
adverse effect on its financial condition and operating results. 
 
The Company and other participants in the personal computer, consumer electronics and
mobile communication industries also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for 
 
their products. In
addition, the Company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer, consumer electronics and mobile communication industries, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components
available from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the
suppliers yields have matured. If the Companys supply of a key single-sourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, if such components were available only at significantly higher prices, or if a key
manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Companys business and financial performance could also be
adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices,
or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements. 
 
Significant portions of the Companys Mac computers, iPods, iPhones, logic boards, and other assembled products are now manufactured by outsourcing partners, primarily in various parts of Asia. A significant
concentration of this outsourced manufacturing is currently performed by only a few of the Companys outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced supplier of components and
manufacturing outsourcing for many of the Companys key products including, but not limited to final assembly of substantially all of the Companys portable Mac computers, iPods, iPhones and most of the Companys iMacs. Although the
Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Companys operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The Companys
purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days.

Long-Term Supply Agreements 
 
During 2006, the Company entered into long-term supply agreements with Hynix Semiconductor, Inc., Intel Corporation, Micron Technology, Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and Toshiba Corporation to secure supply of
NAND flash memory through calendar year 2010. As part of these agreements, the Company prepaid $1.25 billion for flash memory components during 2006, which will be applied to certain inventory purchases made over the life of each respective
agreement. The Company utilized $567 million of the prepayment as of September 27, 2008. 
 
Contingencies 
 
The Company is subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully adjudicated. In the
opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results.
However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. If the Company failed to prevail in any of these legal matters or if several of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the
operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. 
 
Production and marketing of products in certain states and
countries may subject the Company to environmental, product safety and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for
environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including various countries within Europe and Asia, certain Canadian provinces and
certain states within the U.S. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will
not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition or operating results. 
 
Note 9Segment Information and Geographic Data

 
In accordance with SFAS No. 131, 
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information
, the Company
reports segment information based on the management approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Companys reportable
segments.
 
 
The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. Accordingly, the Company determined its operating segments, which are
generally based on the nature and location of its customers, to be the Americas, Europe, Japan, Asia-Pacific, Retail, and FileMaker operations. The Companys reportable operating segments consist of Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail
operations. Other operating segments include Asia Pacific, which encompasses Australia and Asia except for Japan, and the Companys FileMaker, Inc. subsidiary. The Americas, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific segments exclude activities related to
the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries, as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Retail segment operates Apple-owned retail stores in the U.S. and in
international markets. Each reportable operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services to the same types of customers. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1,
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. 
 
The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales and operating
income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers, while Retail segment net sales are based on sales from the Companys retail stores. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third
parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising

expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and
expense and certain expenses managed outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses, such as manufacturing costs and variances not included in standard costs, research and development,
corporate marketing expenses, stock-based compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges, and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for
management reporting purposes. Segment assets exclude corporate assets, such as cash, short-term and long-term investments, manufacturing and corporate facilities, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible
assets. Except for the Retail segment, capital asset purchases for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment. Cash payments for capital asset purchases by the Retail segment were $389 million, $294 million, and $200 million for
2008, 2007, and 2006 respectively. 
 
The Company has certain retail stores that have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand
awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Companys more typical retail stores. The
Company allocates certain operating expenses associated with its high-profile stores to corporate marketing expense to reflect the estimated Company-wide benefit. The allocation of these operating costs to corporate expense is based on the amount
incurred for a high-profile store in excess of that incurred by a more typical Company retail location. The Company had opened a total of 11 high-profile stores as of September 27, 2008. Expenses allocated to corporate marketing resulting from
the operations of high-profile stores were $53 million, $39 million, and $33 million for the years ended September 27, 2008, September 29, 2007, and September 30, 2006 respectively.

The Company entered into a Reimbursement Agreement with its CEO, Steve Jobs, for the reimbursement of expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs in the operation of his private plane when used for Apple business. The Company recognized a total of
approximately $871,000, $776,000, and $202,000 in expenses pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement during 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. All expenses recognized pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement have been included in selling, general, and
administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 
In 2006, the Company entered into an agreement with Pixar to sell certain of
Pixars short films on the iTunes Store. Mr. Jobs was the CEO, Chairman, and a large shareholder of Pixar. On May 5, 2006, The Walt Disney Company (Disney) acquired Pixar, which resulted in Pixar becoming a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Disney. Upon Disneys acquisition of Pixar, Mr. Jobs shares of Pixar common stock were exchanged for Disneys common stock and he was elected to the Disney Board of Directors. Royalty expense recognized by the
Company under the arrangement with Pixar from September 25, 2005 through May 5, 2006 was less than $1 million.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
The Board of Directors and Shareholders 
 
Apple Inc.: 
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 27, 2008. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. 
 
We conducted our
audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Apple Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 27, 2008, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
As discussed in note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, effective September 30, 2007, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, 
Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxesan interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109
. 
 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Apple Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2008, based on criteria established in 
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated November 4, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
The Board of Directors and Shareholders 
 
Apple Inc.: 
 
We have audited Apple Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2008, based on criteria established in
 Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Apples management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
In
our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2008, based on criteria established in 
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework
 issued by the COSO.

 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of
Apple Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
September 27, 2008, and our report dated November 4, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior year
amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been
reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.


Typically, the Companys
fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of September. Fiscal years 2005 and 2004
 were each 52-week
years. However, approximately every six years, the Company reports a 53-week
fiscal year to align its fiscal quarters with calendar quarters by adding a
week to its first fiscal quarter. The Company added this additional week in the
first fiscal quarter of its fiscal year 2006. All information presented herein
is based on the Companys fiscal calendar.


Common Stock Split


On February 28, 2005,
the Company effected a two-for-one stock split to shareholders of record as of February 18,
2005. All share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to
reflect the stock split.


Financial
Instruments


Cash Equivalents
and Short-term Investments


All highly liquid
investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are
classified as cash equivalents. Highly liquid investments with maturities
greater than three months at the date of purchase are classified as short-term
investments. The Companys debt and marketable equity securities have been
classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. Management
determines the appropriate classification of its investments in debt and
marketable equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates the
available-for-sale designations as of each balance sheet date. These securities
are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes,
reported as a component of shareholders equity. The cost of securities sold is
based upon the specific identification method.


Derivative
Financial Instruments


The Company accounts for its derivative instruments as
either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value. Derivatives that
are not defined as hedges in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 133, 
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities,
 as amended, must be adjusted to fair value
through earnings. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the
hedge, 


77
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 1Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies
 (Continued)


changes in fair value will either be offset against
the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments
through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged
item is recognized in earnings.


For derivative instruments
that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are
designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on
the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income in shareholders equity and reclassified into earnings in
the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects
earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative
instrument is recognized in current earnings. To receive hedge accounting
treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to
expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. For derivative instruments
that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability
and that are designated as fair value hedges, the net gain or loss on the
derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item
attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current
period. The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative
instrument that is designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency
translation exposure of the net investment in a foreign operation is reported
in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For forward contracts
designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value
relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of
effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this component are
recognized in current earnings.


Inventories


Inventories are stated at
the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out method, or market. If
the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are made
currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. The Companys
inventories consist primarily of finished goods for all periods presented.


Property, Plant,
and Equipment


Property, plant, and
equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is
the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, up to
5 years for equipment, and the shorter of lease terms or 10 years for leasehold
improvements. The Company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop
internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project
stage. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which
range from 3 to 5 years. Depreciation and amortization expense on property and
equipment was $180 million, $141 million, and $126 million during 2006, 2005,
and 2004, respectively.


Asset Retirement
Obligations


The Company records obligations associated with the
retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement
costs in accordance with SFAS No. 143, 
Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations
. The Company reviews legal obligations
associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the
acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. If it
is determined that a legal obligation exists, the fair value of the liability
for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is
incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of
the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this
additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. The
difference between the gross expected future cash flow and its 


78

present value is accreted over the life of the related
lease as an operating expense. All of the Companys existing asset retirement
obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to
operating leases to original condition upon lease termination.

Long-Lived
Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets


The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment and
certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment in
accordance with SFAS No. 144, 
Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of.

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability
of these assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future
undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property,
plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be
impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the
carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. For the three
fiscal years ended September 30, 2006, the Company had no material
impairment of its long-lived assets, except for the impairment of certain
assets in connection with the restructuring actions described in Note 6 of
these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.


SFAS No. 142, 
Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets
 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but rather be tested for
impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. The Company performs its
goodwill impairment tests on or about August 30 of each year. The Company
did not recognize any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in 2006,
2005, or 2004. The Company established reporting units based on its current
reporting structure. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill
has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each
reporting unit.


SFAS No. 142 also
requires that intangible assets with definite lives be amortized over their
estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144.
The Company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with
definite lives over periods ranging from 3 to 10 years.


Foreign Currency
Translation


The Company translates the assets and liabilities of
its international non-U.S. functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars
using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenue and expenses
for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in
effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are credited
or charged to foreign currency translation 


79
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 1Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)


included in accumulated
other comprehensive income in shareholders equity. The Companys foreign
manufacturing subsidiaries and certain other international subsidiaries that
use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and
liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each  period, and inventories, property, and
nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. Gains and losses from
these translations were insignificant and have been included in the Companys
results of operations.


Revenue Recognition


Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale
of hardware, software, peripherals, digital content, and service and support
contracts. The Company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting
standards, including American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97-2, 
Software
Revenue Recognition
, as amended, and Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, 
Revenue Recognition
.


The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is
fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered
delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss
have been transferred. For most of the Companys product sales, these criteria
are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals,
for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales,
the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the
Company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during
transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the
arrangement fee is not, or is presumed not to be, fixed or determinable,
revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and
payable.


Revenue from service and support contracts is deferred
and recognized ratably over the service coverage periods. These contracts
typically include extended phone support, repair services, web-based support
resources, diagnostic tools, and extend the service coverage offered under the
Companys one-year limited warranty.


The Company sells software and peripheral products
obtained from other companies. The Company establishes its own pricing and
retains related inventory risk, is the primary obligor in sales transactions
with its customers, and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its
customers. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue for the sale of products
obtained from other companies based on the gross amount billed.


Revenue on arrangements
that include multiple elements such as hardware, software, and services is
allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element.
Each elements allocated revenue is recognized when revenue recognition
criteria for that element have been met. Fair value is generally determined by
vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE), which is based on the price
charged when each element is sold separately. If the Company cannot objectively
determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in a
multiple-element arrangement, the Company defers revenue until all elements are
delivered and services have been performed, or until fair value can objectively
be determined for any remaining undelivered elements. When the fair value of a
delivered element has not been established, the Company uses the residual method
to recognize revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements is
determinable. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered
elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is
allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue.


80
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 1Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)


The Company records reductions to revenue for
estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive
programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and
volume-based incentives. The estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a
reduction to revenue in the  period the
Company has sold the product and committed to a plan. The Company also records
reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Companys
historical experience.


Generally, the Company
does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in
connection with software sales or the sale of extended warranty and support
contracts. When the Company does offer specified upgrade rights, the Company
defers revenue for the fair value of the specified upgrade right until the
future obligation is fulfilled or when the right to the specified upgrade
expires. Additionally, a limited number of the Companys software products are
available with maintenance agreements that grant customers rights to
unspecified future upgrades over the maintenance term on a when and if
available basis. Revenue associated with such maintenance is recognized ratably
over the maintenance term.


Allowance for
Doubtful Accounts


The Company records its
allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. The
Company considers historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable
balances, credit quality of the Companys customers, current economic
conditions, and other factors that may affect customers ability to pay.


Shipping Costs


For all periods presented,
amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as
revenue, and the Companys shipping and handling costs are included in cost of
sales.


Warranty Expense


The Company provides for
the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related
revenue is recognized. The Company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting
warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual
experience and changes in future estimates.


Software
Development Costs


Research and development costs are expensed as
incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or
otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a products
technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is
available for general release to customers pursuant to SFAS No. 86, 
Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed
.
In most instances, the Companys products are released soon after technological
feasibility has been established. Therefore, costs incurred subsequent to
achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and
generally all software development costs have been immediately expensed.


In 2004, the Company began
incurring substantial development costs associated with Mac OS X version 10.4
Tiger (Tiger) subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility as
evidenced by public demonstration in August 2004 and the subsequent
release of a developer beta version of the product. The Company capitalized
approximately $29.7 million and $4.5 million during 2005 and 2004,
respectively, of costs associated with the development of Tiger. In accordance
with SFAS No. 86, amortization of this asset to cost of sales began in April 2005
when the Company began shipping Tiger and is being recognized on a
straight-line basis over a three-year estimated useful life.


81
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 1Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)


During 2004, the Company incurred substantial
development costs associated with FileMaker Pro 7 subsequent to achievement of
technological feasibility as evidenced by public demonstration and release of a
developer beta version, and prior to the release of the final version of the
product in March 2004. Therefore, during 2004, the Company capitalized
approximately $2.3 million of costs associated with the development of
FileMaker Pro 7. In accordance with SFAS No. 86, amortization of this
asset to cost of sales began in March 2004 when the Company began shipping
FileMaker Pro 7 and is being recognized on a straight-line basis over a
three-year estimated useful life.


Total amortization related
to capitalized software development costs was $17.8 million, $15.7 million, and
$10.7 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.


Advertising Costs


Advertising costs are
expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $338 million, $287 million, and
$206 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.


Stock-Based
Compensation


On September 25, 2005, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123
(revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), 
Share-Based Payment
,
which addresses the accounting for stock-based payment transactions in which an
enterprise receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity
instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on the
fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by the
issuance of such equity instruments. In January 2005, the SEC issued SAB No. 107,
which provides supplemental implementation guidance for SFAS No. 123R.
SFAS No. 123R eliminates the ability to account for stock-based
compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method under Accounting
Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, 
Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees
, and instead generally requires that
such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. The Company
uses the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) option-pricing model to determine the
fair-value of stock-based awards under SFAS No. 123R, consistent with that
used for pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123, 
Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation
. The Company has elected to use the
modified prospective transition method as permitted by SFAS No. 123R and
accordingly prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of SFAS No. 123R.
The modified prospective transition method requires that stock-based
compensation expense be recorded for all new and unvested stock options,
restricted stock, restricted stock units, and employee stock purchase plan
shares that are ultimately expected to vest as the requisite service is
rendered beginning on September 25, 2005, the first day of the Companys
fiscal year 2006. Stock-based compensation expense for awards granted prior to September 25,
2005 is based on the grant-date fair-value as determined under the pro forma
provisions of SFAS No. 123. The Company recognized incremental stock-based
compensation expense of $117 million during 2006 as a result of the adoption of
SFAS No. 123R. Diluted earnings per common share was reduced by $0.10 for
the year ended September 30, 2006 due to the adoption of SFAS
No. 123R. In accordance with SFAS No. 123R, beginning in 2006 the
Company has presented excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock-based
compensation awards as a financing activity in the consolidated statement of
cash flows.


No stock-based
compensation costs have been capitalized as of September 30, 2006. The
income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation expense was $39 million
for the year ended September 30, 2006. As of September 30, 2006,
$375.2 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options
and restricted stock units is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
period of 2.91 years.


82
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 1Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)


SFAS No. 123R prohibits recognition of a deferred
tax asset for an excess tax benefit that has not been realized. The Company
will recognize a benefit from stock-based compensation in equity if an
incremental tax benefit is realized by following the ordering provisions of the
tax law. In addition, the Company accounts for the indirect effects of
stock-based compensation on the research tax credit, the foreign tax credit,
and the domestic manufacturing deduction through the income statement.


Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the
Company measured compensation expense for its employee stock-based compensation
plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25.
The Company applied the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123 as amended
by SFAS No. 148, 
Accounting for Stock-Based
CompensationTransition and Disclosure,
 as if the fair-value-based
method had been applied in measuring compensation expense. Under APB Opinion No. 25,
when the exercise price of the Companys employee stock options was equal to
the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant, no
compensation expense was recognized.


The following table
illustrates the effect on net income after taxes and net income per common
share as if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of
SFAS No. 123 to stock-based compensation during 2005 and 2004 (in

Earnings Per Common
Share


Basic earnings per common share is computed by
dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number
of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per
common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by
the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock
that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of common
stock had been issued. The dilutive effect of outstanding options, restricted
stock, and restricted stock units is reflected in diluted earnings per share by
application of the treasury stock method. Under the 


83
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 1Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)


treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market
value of the Companys common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect
from outstanding options, restricted stock, and restricted stock units. Additionally,
the exercise of employee stock options and the vesting of restricted stock and
restricted stock units can result in a greater dilutive effect on earnings per
share.

Comprehensive
Income


Comprehensive income
consists of two components: net income and other comprehensive income. Other
comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains, and losses that under
generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of
shareholders equity but are excluded from net income. The Companys other
comprehensive income is comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments
from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency,
unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as
available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments
accounted for as cash flow hedges.


Segment Information


The Company reports segment information based on the
management approach. The management approach designates the internal
reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as
the source of the Companys reportable segments. Information about the
Companys products, major customers, and geographic areas on a company-wide
basis is also disclosed.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 2Restatement of
Consolidated Financial Statements


The Company is restating its consolidated balance
sheet as of September 24, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years
ended September 24, 2005 and September 25, 2004, and each of the
quarters in fiscal year 2005.


Previously filed annual reports on Form 10-K
and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q affected by the restatements have
not been amended and should not be relied on.


On June 29, 2006, the Company announced that an
internal review had discovered irregularities related to the issuance of
certain stock option grants made between 1997 and 2001, including a grant to
its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Steve Jobs. The Company also announced that
a Special Committee of outside directors (Special Committee) had been formed
and had hired independent counsel to conduct a full investigation of the
Companys past stock option granting practices.


As a result of the internal review and the independent
investigation, management has concluded, and the Audit and Finance Committee of
the Board of Directors agrees, that incorrect measurement dates were used for
financial accounting purposes for certain stock option grants made in prior
periods. Therefore, the Company has recorded additional non-cash stock-based
compensation expense and related tax effects with regard to past stock option
grants, and the Company is restating previously filed financial statements in
this Form 10-K. These adjustments, after tax, amounted to $4
million, $7 million, and $10 million in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The adjustment to 2006 was recorded in the fourth quarter of
fiscal year 2006 due to its insignificance.


The independent counsel and its forensic accountants (Investigative
Team) reviewed the facts and circumstances surrounding stock option grants
made on 259 dates. Based on a review of the totality of evidence and the
applicable law, the Special Committee found no misconduct by current
management. The Special Committees investigation identified a number of grants
for which grant dates were intentionally selected in order to obtain favorable
exercise prices. The terms of these and certain other grants, as discussed
below, were finalized after the originally assigned grant dates. The Special
Committee concluded that the procedures for granting, accounting for, and
reporting stock option grants did not include sufficient safeguards to prevent
manipulation. Although the investigation found that CEO Steve Jobs was aware or
recommended the selection of some favorable grant dates, he did not receive or financially
benefit from these grants or appreciate the accounting implications. The
Special Committee also found that the investigation had raised serious concerns
regarding the actions of two former officers in connection with the accounting,
recording and reporting of stock option grants.


Based on the evidence and findings from the Companys
internal review and the Special Committees independent investigation, an
analysis was performed of the measurement dates for the 42,077 stock option
grants made on 259 dates between October 1996 and January 2003 (the relevant
period). The Company believes that the analysis was properly limited to the
relevant period. In addition to analyzing all grants made during the relevant
period, the Company sampled certain grants between 1994 and 1997 and found none
that required accounting adjustments. The first grants for which stock-based
compensation expense is required are dated December 29, 1997. The Company
also examined grants made after the relevant period and found none that
required accounting adjustments. Moreover, in the years after 2002, Apple made
significant changes in its stock option granting practices in response to
evolving legal, regulatory and accounting requirements.


Consistent with the accounting literature and recent
guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the grants during
the relevant period were organized into categories based on grant 


85

 (Continued)


type and process by which the grant was finalized. The
Company analyzed the evidence related to each category of grants including, but
not limited to, electronic and physical documents, document metadata, and
witness interviews. Based on the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company
applied the controlling accounting standards to determine, for every grant
within each category, the proper measurement date. If the measurement date is
not the originally assigned grant date, accounting adjustments were made as
required, resulting in stock-based compensation expense and related tax
effects.


The 42,077 grants were classified as follows: (1) 17
grants to persons elected or appointed to the Board of Directors (director
grants); (2) 3,892 grants to employees under the Monday/Tuesday Plan
described below (Monday/Tuesday grants); (3) 27,096 grants made in
broad-based awards to large numbers of employees, usually on an annual basis (focal
grants); (4) 9,988 other grants ratified at meetings of the Board or
Compensation Committee (meeting grants); (5) 1,082 other grants ratified
by unanimous written consent (UWC) of the Board or Compensation Committee (other
UWC grants); and (6) two grants to the CEO (CEO grants). All references
to the number of option shares, option exercise prices, and share prices in
this Note 2 have not been adjusted for any subsequent stock splits.


With the exception of director grants, all stock
option grants were subject to ratification by the Board or Compensation
Committee at a meeting or by UWC. Following approval of the grants at a meeting
or by UWC, the Companys legal staff would prepare a Secretarys Certificate
certifying the ratification of the grants. Based on the facts and circumstances
described below, the Company has concluded that the recipients and terms of
certain grants were fixed for accounting purposes before ratification pursuant
to parameters previously approved by the Board or Compensation Committee
through the Monday/Tuesday Plan and the focal process. As further discussed
below, within these parameters, management had the authority to determine the
recipients and terms for each grant. Thus, the Company has concluded that the
measurement dates for these grants occurred when managements process for
allocating these grants was completed and the grants were ready for
ratification, which was considered perfunctory. With regard to all other
grants, the Company has concluded that the grants were finalized and the
measurement dates occurred when the grants were ratified. For many grants,
however, the dates of ratification cannot be established because the dates the UWCs
were executed by the Board or Compensation Committee members or received by the
Company are not available. For such grants, the Company has concluded that the
date of the preparation of the Secretarys Certificate is the best alternative
for determining the actual date of ratification.


As discussed below, the Companys analysis determined
that the originally assigned grant dates for 6,428 grants on 42 dates are not
the proper measurement dates. Accordingly, after accounting for forfeitures,
the Company has recognized stock-based compensation expense of $105 million on
a pre-tax basis over the respective awards vesting terms. No adjustments were
required for the remaining 35,649 grants. The adjustments were determined by
category as follows:


Director GrantsSeventeen director grants were made
during the relevant period. Two director grants were made pursuant to a 1997
plan that dated the grants on the enactment of the plan. The remaining fifteen
grants were automatically made under the Director Stock Option Plan for
non-employee directors, which was approved by shareholders in 1998, on the date
of a directors election or appointment to the Board and on subsequent
anniversaries, beginning on the fourth anniversary. Accordingly, the analysis
determined that the originally assigned grant date for each director grant is
the measurement date, and no accounting adjustments are required.

Note 2Restatement
of Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)


Monday/Tuesday GrantsBeginning in December 1998,
3,892 new hire grants and grants for promotion and retention purposes (promotion/retention
grants) were made during the relevant period under the Monday/Tuesday Plan. Under
the Monday/Tuesday Plan, new hire grants made within pre-established guidelines
approved by the Board or Compensation Committee were dated on the Monday that
the recipient started work (or the following Monday, if the recipient started
on another day). The Companys analysis showed this process to be reliable with
very low error rates. Promotion/retention grants, also based on pre-established
guidelines, were made generally on the first Tuesday of each month. The Company
has concluded that the new hire and promotion/retention grants made pursuant to
the Monday/Tuesday Plan within pre-established guidelines do not require
adjustment, with the exception of six grants that were erroneously dated before
the employees start dates. For 120 new hire and promotion/retention grants
made outside the guidelines, however, the Company has concluded that the
measurement dates are the dates of ratification by the Board or Compensation
Committee rather than the dates used for grants within guidelines. Accordingly,
based on the methodology described above, the Company has recognized
stock-based compensation expense of $6 million from 126 grants.


Focal GrantsDuring the relevant period, 27,096 focal
grants were made to employees typically on an annual basis as part of an
extensive process that required several months to complete. Pursuant to limits,
guidelines and practices previously approved by the Board or Compensation Committee,
managers throughout the Company would make recommendations for grants to
employees in their areas of responsibility. After senior management had
determined that the grants were made in accordance with these established
limits, guidelines and practices, management treated the grants as final when
they were submitted to the Board or Compensation Committee for ratification. The
Company has concluded that for 5,595 grants on five dates, the originally
assigned grant dates are not the proper measurement dates. For these grants,
managements process for finalizing the grants was completed after the originally
assigned grant dates. As a result, the Company has recognized $29 million of
stock-based compensation expense. For two of the five grant dates comprising
3,744 grants, the evidence shows that the grants were finalized and the
measurement date occurred one day after the originally assigned grant dates. The
grants on these two dates represent more than $16 million of the total $29
million of stock-based compensation expense resulting from focal grants.


Other Meeting GrantsDuring the relevant period,
meetings of the Board or Compensation Committee were held to ratify 9,988
grants that are not Monday/Tuesday, focal or CEO grants. The grant dates and
measurement dates for these grants are the meeting dates when the grants were
ratified, with the exception of 46 grants. Forty-two of these 46 grants are
dated concurrent with a meeting that considered and approved certain grants,
but the evidence indicates that all of the grants may not have been finalized
until a later date. One of the 46 grants was approved and dated at another
meeting, but the recipient, who was becoming employed by the Company as part of
a corporate acquisition, did not start until a later date. Two other grants
were approved before the employees start dates. Another grant was mistakenly
cancelled and subsequently reinstated, requiring an accounting adjustment.
Thus, for these 46 grants the Company has concluded that the originally assigned
grant dates are not the proper measurement dates. As a result, the Company has
recognized $2 million of stock-based compensation expense.


Other UWC GrantsDuring the relevant period, 1,082
grants were approved by UWCs for a variety of purposes, including executive
recruitment, retention, promotion and new hires outside the Monday/Tuesday
process. These grants were not made pursuant to pre-established guidelines
adopted by the Board or Compensation Committee. Therefore, the Company has
concluded that these grants were 


87
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 2Restatement
of Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)


not finalized for accounting purposes until
ratification by the Board or Compensation Committee. Accordingly, for 660
grants, the Company has concluded that the originally assigned grant dates are
not the proper measurement dates. As a result, the Company has recognized $48
million of stock-based compensation expense.


CEO GrantsDuring the relevant period, the Company
made two grants to CEO Steve Jobs. The first grant, dated January 12,
2000, was for 10 million option shares. The second grant, dated October 19,
2001, was for 7.5 million option shares. Both grants were cancelled in March 2003
prior to being exercised, when Mr. Jobs received 5 million shares of
restricted stock.


With respect to the grant dated January 12, 2000,
the Board on December 2, 1999, authorized a special CEO Compensation
Committee to grant Mr. Jobs up to 15 million shares. The evidence
indicates that the CEO Compensation Committee finalized the terms of the grant
on January 12, 2000, although the Committees action was memorialized in a
UWC transmitted on January 18, 2000. Because the measurement date is the originally
assigned grant date, the Company has not recognized any stock-based
compensation expense from this grant. If the Company had determined that the
measurement date was the date when the UWC was executed or received, then
additional stock-based compensation would have been recognized.


The grant dated October 19, 2001 was originally
approved at a Board meeting on August 29, 2001, with an exercise price of
$17.83. The terms of the grant, however, were not finalized until December 18,
2001. The grant was dated October 19, 2001, with an exercise price of
$18.30. The approval for the grant was improperly recorded as occurring at a
special Board meeting on October 19, 2001. Such a special Board meeting
did not occur. There was no evidence, however, that any current member of
management was aware of this irregularity. The Company has recognized $20
million in stock-based compensation expense for this grant, reflecting the
difference between the exercise price of $18.30 and the share price on December 18,
2001 of $21.01.

from recognizing stock-based compensation expense resulting from the
investigation of past stock option grants is as follows (dollars in millions):

The unrealized losses on
the Companys investments during 2006 in U.S. Government securities and during
2005 in U.S. Government securities, U.S. corporate securities, and foreign
securities were caused primarily by changes in interest rates. The Company
typically invests in highly-rated securities with low probabilities of default.
The Companys investment policy requires investments to be rated single-A or
better. Therefore, the Company considers the declines to be temporary in nature.
As of September 30, 2006, the Company does not consider the investments to
be other-than-temporarily impaired.


Market values were
determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When
evaluating the investments for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company
reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has
been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, and the Companys
ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time, which may be
sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value.

Accounts Receivable


Trade Receivables


The Company distributes its products through
third-party distributors and resellers and directly to certain education,
consumer, and commercial customers. The Company generally does not require
collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral in
certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company
does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance
for certain customers in Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Australia and by
arranging with third-party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements
and other loan and lease programs to the Companys direct customers. These
credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing
company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume
any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.
However, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral,
third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the
Companys distribution and retail channel partners. No customer accounted for
more than 10% of trade receivables as of September 30, 2006 or September 24,
2005.

Vendor Non-Trade
Receivables


The Company has non-trade
receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale
of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture
sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company
purchases these raw material components directly from suppliers. These
non-trade receivables, which are included in the consolidated balance sheets in
other current assets, totaled $1.6 billion and $417 million as of September 30,
2006 and September 24, 2005, respectively. The Company does not reflect
the sale of these components in net sales and does not recognize any profits on
these sales until the products are sold through to the end customer at which
time the profit is recognized as a reduction of cost of sales.


Derivative
Financial Instruments


The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its
business exposure to foreign exchange risk. Foreign currency forward and option
contracts are used to offset the foreign exchange risk on certain existing
assets and liabilities and to hedge the foreign exchange risk on expected
future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales. From time to
time, the Company enters into interest rate derivative agreements to modify the
interest rate profile of certain investments and debt. The Companys accounting
policies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are
designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. The Company records all
derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.

The notional principal amounts for derivative
instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of
year-end, and do not represent the amount of the Companys exposure to credit
or market loss. The credit risk amounts shown in the table above represents the
Companys gross exposure to potential accounting loss on these transactions if
all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract,
based on then-current currency exchange rates at each respective date.
The Companys exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a
function of currency exchange rates.


The estimates of fair
value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models and prevailing
financial market information as of September 30, 2006 and September 24,
2005. Although the table above reflects the notional principal, fair value, and
credit risk amounts of the Companys foreign exchange instruments, it does not
reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that
the foreign exchange instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately
realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the
gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market
conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.


Foreign Exchange
Risk Management


The Company may enter into foreign currency forward
and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign
exchange risk associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly
committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in
foreign subsidiaries. Generally, the Companys practice is to hedge a majority
of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the
Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to
immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, or
limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments.


To help protect gross margins from fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates, the Companys U.S. dollar functional
subsidiaries hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and the
Companys non-U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries selling in local currencies
hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the
subsidiaries functional currency. Other comprehensive income 


94
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 3Financial
Instruments (Continued)


associated with hedges of foreign currency revenue is
recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related sales
are recognized, and other comprehensive income related to inventory purchases
is recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related
costs are recognized. Typically, the Company hedges portions of its forecasted
foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases over
a time horizon of up to 6 months.


Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges
must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable that the forecasted hedged
transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a
subsequent 2 month time period. Deferred gains and losses in other
comprehensive income associated with such derivative instruments are
immediately reclassified into earnings in other income and expense. Any
subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are also
reflected in current earnings unless they are re-designated as hedges of other
transactions. The Company recognized a net gain of approximately $421,000 in
2006 and net losses of $1.6 million and $2.8 million in 2005 and 2004,
respectively, in other income and expense related to the loss of hedge
designation on discontinued cash flow hedges due to changes in the Companys
forecast of future net sales and cost of sales and due to prevailing market
conditions. As of September 30, 2006, the Company had a net deferred gain
associated with cash flow hedges of approximately $2.8 million, net of taxes,
substantially all of which is expected to be reclassified to earnings by the
end of the second quarter of fiscal 2007.


The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a
derivative instrument designated as a net investment hedge is included in the
cumulative translation adjustment account of accumulated other comprehensive
income within shareholders equity. For the years ended September 30, 2006
and September 24, 2005, the Company had net gains of $7.4 million and
$673,000, respectively, included in the cumulative translation adjustment.


The Company may also enter
into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign
exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and
liabilities recorded in non-functional currencies. Changes in the fair value of
these derivatives are recognized in current earnings in other income and
expense as offsets to the changes in the fair value of the related assets or
liabilities. Due to currency market movements, changes in option time value can
lead to increased volatility in other income and expense.

As of September 30, 2006, and September 24,
2005, the weighted-average amortization period for acquired technology was 8.5
years and 5.5 years, respectively.


During 2006, the Company sold certain assets related
to its PowerSchool web-based student information system operations. In
connection with this sale, the Company reduced goodwill by $31 million for the
outstanding balance from the acquisition of PowerSchool, Inc. in 2001 and
recognized a $4 million pre-tax gain, which is reflected in other income and
expense in the consolidated statement of operations.


During 2005, the Company recorded an adjustment of
approximately $11 million to goodwill relating to a reduction of valuation
allowances that were recorded at the time certain net operating loss
carryforwards (NOLs) were acquired in previous business combinations. During
2005, these NOLs were deemed to be more likely than not to be realized and
accordingly the valuation allowances were reversed against the related goodwill
that was recognized at the time of the acquisitions.

impairments, and $3.5 million for lease cancellations. The lease cancellations
relate to vacating a leased sales facility from a European workforce reduction
during 2004. Of the $23.0 million charges, $21.3 million had been utilized by
the end of 2006, with the remainder consisting of $1.7 million for lease
cancellations. These actions have resulted in the termination of 452 positions.

The foreign provision for income taxes is based on

million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. As of September 30, 2006,

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 7Income
Taxes
 (Continued)


approximately $4.1 billion of the Companys cash, cash
equivalents, and short-term investments were held by foreign subsidiaries
and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held
by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on
repatriation to the U.S. The Companys consolidated financial statements
provide for any related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated, aside
from undistributed earnings of certain of the Companys foreign subsidiaries
that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the U.S.
U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $823 million
of such earnings. It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability
that might be incurred if these earnings were to be distributed.


On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation
Act of 2004 (AJCA) was signed into law. The AJCA included a provision for the
deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that were repatriated, as defined
in the AJCA, within a specified time frame. Among other requirements, dividends
qualifying for the 85% deduction must be reinvested in the United States in
certain qualified investments pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan approved
by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Board of Directors. During 2006, the
Company repatriated approximately $1.6 billion of foreign earnings. Of the
earnings repatriated, $755 million is eligible for the reduced tax rate
provided by the AJCA. Accordingly, the Company recorded a tax charge of $51
million related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the provisions of
the AJCA. In addition, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $71 million
resulting from the implementation of tax planning strategies to recognize
deferred tax assets that were previously not recognizable within certain
foreign subsidiaries.


Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the
effects of tax losses, credits, and the future income tax effects of temporary
differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured
using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

Note 7Income
Taxes (Continued)


As of September 30, 2006, the Company has state
and foreign tax loss and state credit carryforwards, the tax effect of which is
$55 million. Certain of those carryforwards, the tax effect of which is $12
million, expire between 2016 
a
nd 2019. A
portion of these carryforwards was acquired from the Companys previous
acquisitions, the utilization of which is subject to certain limitations
imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The remaining benefits from tax losses
and credits do not expire. As of September 30, 2006 and September 24,
2005, a valuation allowance of $5 million was recorded against the deferred tax
asset for the benefits of state operating losses that may not be realized. Management
believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income
that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together
with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to
fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets.


A

The Companys income taxes
payable has been reduced by the tax benefits from employee stock options. The
Company receives an income tax benefit calculated as the difference between the
fair market value of the stock issued at the time of the exercise and the
option price, tax effected. The net tax benefits from employee stock option
transactions were $419 million, $428 million (as restated(1)), and $83 million
(as restated(1)) in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, and were reflected as
an increase to common stock in the consolidated statements of shareholders
equity.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 7Income
Taxes (Continued)


The Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) has substantially completed its field audit of the Companys
federal income tax returns for the years 2002 through 2003 and proposed certain
adjustments. The Company intends to contest certain of these adjustments
through the IRS Appeals Office. Substantially all IRS audit issues for years
prior to 2002 have been resolved. In addition, the Company is also subject to
audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities. Management believes that
adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax
examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with
certainty. Should any issues addressed in the Companys tax audits be resolved
in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the Company could be
required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution
occurs. In 2006, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $20 million due to
the settlement of prior year tax audits in the U.S.


Note 8Shareholders
Equity


Preferred Stock


The Company has five
million shares of authorized preferred stock, none of which is outstanding.
Under the terms of the Companys Restated Articles of Incorporation, the Board
of Directors is authorized to determine or alter the rights, preferences,
privileges, and restrictions of the Companys authorized but unissued shares of
preferred stock.


Restricted Stock Units


The Companys Board of Directors has granted
restricted stock units to members of the Companys senior management team,
excluding its CEO. These restricted stock units generally vest over four years
either at the end of the four-year service period, in two equal installments on
the second and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant, or in equal
installments on each of the first through fourth anniversaries of the grant
date. Upon vesting, the restricted stock units will convert into an equivalent
number of shares of common stock. The amounts of the restricted stock units
expensed by the Company are based on the closing market price of the Companys
common stock on the date of grant and are amortized on a straight-line basis
over the four-year requisite service period. The restricted stock units have
been reflected in the calculation of diluted earnings per share utilizing the
treasury stock method.


2.47 million previously
granted restricted stock units vested during 2006. A majority of these vested
restricted stock units were net-share settled such that the Company withheld
shares with value equivalent to the employees minimum statutory obligation for
the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the
appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld of 985,833 for 2006
was based on the value of the restricted stock units on their vesting date as
determined by the Companys closing stock price. Total payments for the
employees tax obligations to the taxing authorities were approximately $59 million.
These net-share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the Company
as they reduced and retired the number of shares that would have otherwise been
issued as a result of the vesting and did not represent an expense to the
Company.


CEO Restricted Stock Award


On March 19, 2003,
the Companys Board of Directors granted 10 million shares of restricted stock
to the Companys CEO that vested on March 19, 2006. The amount of the
restricted stock award expensed by the Company was based on the closing market
price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant and was amortized on a
straight-line basis over the three-year requisite service period.


101
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 8Shareholders
Equity
 (Continued)


Upon vesting during 2006,
the restricted stock award was net-share settled such that the Company withheld
shares with value equivalent to the CEOs minimum statutory obligation for the
applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the
appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld of 4.6 million was
based on the value of the restricted stock award on the vesting date as
determined by the Companys closing stock price of $64.66. The remaining shares
net of those withheld were delivered to the Companys CEO. Total payments for
the CEOs tax obligations to the taxing authorities were approximately $296
million. The net-share settlement had the effect of share repurchases by the
Company as it reduced and retired the number of shares outstanding and did not
represent an expense to the Company.


Stock Repurchase Plan


In July 1999, the
Companys Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up
to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does not obligate the
Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any
specified period of time. The Company has repurchased a total of 13.1 million
shares at a cost of $217 million under this plan and was authorized to
repurchase up to an additional $283 million of its common stock as of September 30,
2006.


Comprehensive Income


Comprehensive income consists of two components: net
income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to
revenue, expenses, gains, and losses that under U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders equity but
are excluded from net income. The Companys other comprehensive income consists
of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using
the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on
marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains
and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges.

Employee Benefit Plans


2003 Employee Stock Plan


The 2003 Employee Stock
Plan (the 2003 Plan) is a shareholder approved plan that provides for
broad-based grants to employees, including executive officers. Based on the
terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 2003 Plan
generally expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and generally become
exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment, with
either annual or quarterly vesting. The 2003 Plan permits the granting of
incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock units,
stock appreciation rights, and stock purchase rights.


1997 Employee Stock Option Plan


In August 1997, the
Companys Board of Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 1997
Plan), a non-shareholder approved plan for grants of stock options to employees
who are not officers of the Company. Based on the terms of individual option
grants, options granted under the 1997 Plan generally expire 7 to 10 years
after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years,
based on continued employment, with either annual or quarterly vesting. In October 2003,
the Company terminated the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan and cancelled all
remaining unissued shares totaling 28,590,702. No new options can be granted
from the 1997 Plan.


Employee Stock Option Exchange Program


On March 20, 2003,
the Company announced a voluntary employee stock option exchange program (the Exchange
Program) whereby eligible employees, other than executive officers and members
of the Board of Directors, had an opportunity to exchange outstanding options
with exercise prices at or above $12.50 per share for a predetermined smaller
number of new stock options issued with exercise prices equal to the fair
market value of one share of the Companys common stock on the day the new
awards were issued, which was to be at least six months plus one day after the
exchange options were cancelled. On April 17, 2003, in accordance with the
Exchange Program, the Company cancelled options to purchase 33,138,386 shares
of its common stock. On October 22, 2003, new stock options totaling
13,394,736 shares were issued to employees at an exercise price of $11.38 per
share, which is equivalent to the closing price of the Companys stock on that
date. No financial or accounting impact to the Companys financial position,
results of operations or cash flows was associated with this transaction.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 8Shareholders Equity (Continued)


1997 Director Stock Option Plan


In August 1997, the
Companys Board of Directors adopted a Director Stock Option Plan (Director
Plan) for non-employee directors of the Company, which was approved by
shareholders in 1998. 
Pursuant to the
Director Plan, the Companys non-employee directors are granted an option to
acquire 30,000 shares of Common Stock upon their initial election to the Board
(Initial Options

). The Initial Options vest and
become exercisable in three equal annual installments on each of the first
through third anniversaries of the grant date. On the fourth anniversary of a
non-employee directors initial election to the Board and on each subsequent
anniversary thereafter, the director will be entitled to receive an option to
acquire 10,000 shares of Common Stock (Annual Options). Annual Options are
fully vested and immediately exercisable on their date of grant.


Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans


Certain of the Companys
executive officers, including Mr. Timothy D. Cook, Mr. Peter
Oppenheimer, Mr. Philip W. Schiller, and Dr. Bertrand Serlet, have
entered into trading plans pursuant to Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. A trading plan is a written
document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for
determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the
Companys stock including the exercise and sale of employee stock options and
shares acquired pursuant to the Companys employee stock purchase plan and upon
vesting of restricted stock units.


Employee Stock Purchase Plan


The Company has a
shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan (the Purchase Plan), under
which substantially all employees may purchase common stock through payroll
deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values as of
the beginning and end of six month offering periods. Stock purchases under the
Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of an employees compensation, up to a maximum
of $25,000 in any calendar year. The number of shares authorized for issuance
is limited to a total of 1 million shares per offering period. During 2006,
2005, and 2004, adjusted for the February 2005 stock split, 1.5 million,
2.3 million, and 3.9 million shares, respectively, were issued under the
Purchase Plan. As of September 30, 2006, approximately 2.3 million shares
were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan.


Employee Savings Plan


The Company has an employee savings plan (the Savings
Plan) qualifying as a deferred salary arrangement under
Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the Savings Plan,
participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up
to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limit ($15,000 for calendar
year 2006). The Company matches 50% to 100% of each employees contributions,
depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employees earnings.
The Companys matching contributions to the Savings Plan were approximately $33
million, $28 million, and $24 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004,
respectively.

In conjunction with the amendments to the 2003 Plan
that were approved at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on April 21,
2005, the number of shares available for grant under the 2003 Plan will be
reduced by two times the number of restricted shares and restricted stock units
granted. This amendment is effective for all grants made after April 21,
2005.


Aggregate intrinsic value represents the value of the
Companys closing stock price on the last trading day of the fiscal period in
excess of the exercise price multiplied by the number of options outstanding or
exercisable. Total intrinsic value of options at time of exercise was $1.2
billion, $1.1 billion, and $266.9 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004,
respectively.


As of September 30, 2006, the Company had 3.41
million restricted stock units outstanding with a total grant-date fair value
of $135.1 million that were excluded from the options outstanding balances in
the preceding table. The weighted-average grant date fair value of restricted
stock units granted during 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $70.92, $45.04, and $12.81,
respectively. Aggregate intrinsic value of unvested restricted stock units at September 30,
2006 was $262.5 million. Restricted stock units that vested during 2006 totaled
2.47 million and had a fair value of $148.5 million as of the vesting date. Granted
restricted stock units have been deducted from the shares available for grant
under the Companys stock option plans.

The number of shares of restricted
stock that vested during 2006 was 10 million, which had a fair value of $646.6

2006 was $7.48 per share. For the years ended September 30, 2006, September 24,
2005, and September 25, 2004, compensation expense related to restricted
stock was $4.6 million, $24.9 million, and $24.9 million, respectively.


Note 9Stock-Based
Compensation


The Company has provided pro forma disclosures in Note
1 of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the effect on net
income and earnings per share for the years ended September 24, 2005 and September 25,
2004 as if the fair value method of accounting for stock compensation had been
used for its employee stock option grants and employee stock purchase plan
purchases. These pro forma effects have been estimated at the date of grant and
beginning of the period, respectively, using the BSM option pricing model.


The
weighted average assumptions used for 2006, 2005, and 2004 and the resulting estimates
of weighted-average fair value per share of options granted and for stock
purchases during those periods are as follows:

Pursuant to SFAS No. 123R,
the expected volatility assumptions used by the Company are based on the
historical volatility of the Companys common stock over the most recent period
commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Companys stock options
and other relevant factors including implied volatility in market traded
options on the Companys common stock. The Company bases its expected life
assumption on its historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the
stock options it grants to employees.

Accrued Warranty
and Indemnifications


The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor
warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period for hardware
products is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. The
Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to
repair the Companys hardware products. The Company provides currently for the
estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product warranties
at the time related revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining
appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the
installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical and
projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and
knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Companys
typical experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting
warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual
experience and changes in future estimates.


The Company periodically provides updates to its
applications and system software to maintain the softwares compliance with
specifications. The estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for as
warranty costs that are recognized at the time related software revenue is
recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to
such updates include the number of units delivered, the number of updates
expected to occur, and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the
resources necessary to develop these updates.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 10Commitments
and Contingencies (Continued)


The
Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and
application software against legal claims that the software infringes
third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the
Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company
could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim
against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not
been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an
infringement claim asserted against itself or an indemnified third-party and,
in the opinion of management, does not have a potential liability related to
unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a
material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of
operations. Therefore, the Company did not record a liability for infringement
costs as of either September 30, 2006 or September 24, 2005.


Concentrations in
the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product


Although most components
essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple
sources, other key components (including microprocessors and application-specific
integrated circuits (ASICs)) are currently obtained by the Company from
single or limited sources. Some other key components, while currently available
to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide
availability and pricing pressures. In addition, the Company uses some
components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry,
and new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom
components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated
whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers. If
the supply of a key single-sourced component to the Company were to be
delayed or curtailed, or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays
shipments of completed products to the Company, the Companys ability to ship
related products in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely
affected. The Companys business and financial performance could also be
adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient
quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient
quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these
components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the
production of common components instead of components customized to meet the
Companys requirements. Finally, significant portions of the Companys CPUs,
logic boards, and assembled products are now manufactured by outsourcing
partners, primarily in various parts of Asia. Although the Company works
closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Companys
operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were
unable to meet their production obligations.


Long-Term Supply
Agreements


During 2006, the Company
entered into long-term supply agreements with Hynix Semiconductor, Inc.,
Intel Corporation, Micron Technology, Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.,
and Toshiba Corporation to secure supply of NAND flash memory through calendar
year 2010. As part of these agreements, the Company prepaid $1.25 billion for
flash memory components during 2006. These prepayments will be applied to
inventory purchases made over the life of each respective agreement.


Contingencies


The Company is subject to certain other legal
proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and
have not been fully adjudicated. In the opinion of management, the Company does
not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and
claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse
effect on its financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations. 


108
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 10Commitments
and Contingencies (Continued)


However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be
predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these
legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the
Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular
reporting period could be materially adversely affected.


Production and marketing
of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to
environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the
requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of
its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or
recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been passed
in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates including various
European Union member countries, Japan and certain states within the U.S. Although
the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future
based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no
assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material
adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, liquidity, or results of
operations.


Note 11Segment
Information and Geographic Data


In accordance with SFAS No. 131, 
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information
,
the Company reports segment information based on the management approach. The
management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for
making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Companys
reportable segments.


The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic
basis. The Companys reportable operating segments are comprised of the
Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas, Europe, and Japan reportable
segments do not include activities related to the Retail segment. The Americas
segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes
European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Retail segment
operates Apple-owned retail stores in the U.S., Canada, Japan, and the U.K. Other
operating segments include Asia-Pacific, which includes Australia and Asia
except for Japan, and the Companys subsidiary, FileMaker, Inc. Each
reportable geographic operating segment provides similar hardware and software
products and similar services, and the accounting policies of the various
segments are the same as those described in Note 1, Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies, except as described below for the Retail segment.


The Company evaluates the performance of its operating
segments based on net sales. The Retail segments performance is also evaluated
based on operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally
based on the location of the customers. Operating income for each segment
includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses
directly attributable to the segment. Operating income for each segment
excludes other income and expense and certain expenses that are managed outside
the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include
various corporate expenses such as manufacturing costs and variances not
included in standard costs, research and development, corporate marketing
expenses, stock-based compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring
charges, and other separately managed general and administrative expenses
including certain corporate expenses associated with support of the Retail
segment. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments
for management reporting purposes. Segment assets exclude corporate assets.
Corporate assets include cash, short-term and long-term investments,
manufacturing facilities, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and
other acquired intangible assets, and retail store construction-in-progress
that is not subject to depreciation. Except for the Retail segment, capital 


109
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 11Segment
Information and Geographic Data
 (Continued)


expenditures for long-lived assets are not reported to
management by segment. Capital expenditures by the Retail segment were $200
million, $132 million, and $104 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004,
respectively.Operating income for all segments, except Retail, includes cost of
sales at manufacturing standard cost, other cost of sales, related sales and
marketing costs, and certain general and administrative costs. This measure of
operating income, which includes manufacturing profit, provides a comparable
basis for comparison between the Companys various geographic segments. Certain
manufacturing expenses and related adjustments not included in segment cost of
sales, including variances between standard and actual manufacturing costs and
the mark-up above standard cost for product supplied to the Retail segment, are
included in corporate expenses.


Management assesses the operating performance of the
Retail segment differently than it assesses the operating performance of the
Companys geographic segments. The Retail segment revenue and operating income
is intended to depict a measure comparable to that of the Companys major
channel partners in the U.S. operating retail stores so the Company can
evaluate the Retail segment performance as if it were a channel partner.
Therefore, the Company makes three significant adjustments to the Retail
segment for management reporting purposes that are not included in the results
of the Companys other segments.


First, the Retail segments operating income includes
cost of sales for Apple products at an amount normally charged to major channel
partners in the U.S. operating retail stores, less the cost of sales programs
and incentives provided to those channel partners and the Companys cost to
support those partners. For the years ended September 30, 2006, September 24,
2005, and September 25, 2004, this resulted in the recognition of
additional cost of sales above standard cost by the Retail segment and an
offsetting benefit to corporate expenses of approximately $663 million, $435
million, and $213 million, respectively.


Second, the Companys service and support contracts
are transferred to the Retail segment at the same cost as that charged to the
Companys major retail channel partners in the U.S., resulting in a measure of
revenue and gross margin for those items that is comparable between the Companys
retail stores and those retail channel partners. The Retail segment recognizes
the full amount of revenue and cost of sales of the Companys service and
support contracts at the time of sale. Because the Company has not yet earned
the revenue or incurred the costs associated with the sale of these contracts,
an offset to these amounts is recognized in other operating segments net sales
and cost of sales. For the year ended September 30, 2006, this resulted in
the recognition of net sales and cost of sales by the Retail segment, with
corresponding offsets in other operating segments, of $159 million and $109
million, respectively. For the year ended September 24, 2005, this
resulted in the recognition of net sales and cost of sales by the Retail
segment of $92 million and $64 million, respectively. For the year ended September 25,
2004, this resulted in the recognition of net sales and cost of sales by the
Retail segment of $54 million and $37 million, respectively.


Third, the Company had opened a total of eight
high-profile stores as of September 30, 2006. These high-profile stores
are larger than the Companys typical retail stores and were designed to
further promote brand awareness and provide a venue for certain corporate sales
and marketing activities, including corporate briefings. As such, the Company
allocates certain operating expenses associated with these stores to corporate
marketing expense to reflect the estimated benefit realized Company-wide. The
allocation of these operating costs is based on the amount incurred for a high-profile
store in excess of that incurred by a more typical Company retail location.
Expenses allocated to corporate marketing resulting

from the operations
of these stores were $33 million, $31 million, and $16 million for the years

Note 12Related Party
Transactions and Certain Other Transactions


In March 2002, the Company entered into a
Reimbursement Agreement with its CEO, Steve Jobs, for the reimbursement of
expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs in the operation of his private plane when
used for Company business. The Reimbursement Agreement became effective for
expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs for Company business purposes since he took
delivery of the plane in May 2001. The Company recognized a total of
$202,000, $1,100,000, and $483,000 in expenses pursuant to the Reimbursement
Agreement during 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. All expenses recognized
pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement have been included in selling, general,
and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.


In 2006, the Company
entered into an agreement with Pixar to sell certain of Pixars short films on
the iTunes Store. Mr. Jobs was the CEO, Chairman, and a large shareholder
of Pixar. On May 5, 2006, The Walt Disney Company (Disney) acquired
Pixar, which resulted in Pixar becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Disney.
Upon Disneys acquisition of Pixar, Mr. Jobs shares of Pixar common stock
were exchanged for Disneys common stock and he was elected to the Disney Board
of Directors. Royalty expense recognized by the Company under the arrangement
with Pixar from September 25, 2005 through May 5, 2006 was less than
$1 million.

The impact of the stock-based compensation adjustments
was not significant to any of the interim balance sheets for fiscal year 2005.


Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed
independently for each of the quarters presented. Therefore, the sum of
quarterly basic and diluted per share information may not equal annual basic
and diluted earnings per share.


Net income during the fourth quarter of 2005 benefited
by $81 million from the reversal of certain tax contingency reserves and
adjustments to net deferred tax assets, including reductions to valuation
allowances.

R
eport of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Apple Computer, Inc.:


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Apple Computer, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30,
2006 and September 24, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended September 30, 2006. These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.


We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.


In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of September 30, 2006 and September 24,
2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2006, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


As discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, the consolidated financial statements as of September 24, 2005
and for each of the years in the two-year period ended September 24, 2005
have been restated.


As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, effective September 25, 2005, the Company adopted the
provision of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised
2004), 
Share-Based Payment
.


We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2006, based
on criteria established in 
Internal
Control-Integrated Framework 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated December 29,
2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment of, and the
effective operation of internal control over financial reporting.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Apple Computer, Inc.:


We have audited managements assessment, included in
the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting, that Apple Computer, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2006, based
on criteria established in 
Internal Control-Integrated
Framework 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO). Apple Computer, Inc.s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Apple Computer, Inc.s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.


We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.


A companys internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.


Because of inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


In our opinion, managements assessment that Apple
Computer, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of September 30, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on criteria established in 
Internal
Control-Integrated Framework 
issued by COSO. Also, in our opinion,
Apple Computer, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2006, based
on criteria established in 
Internal
Control-Integrated Framework 
issued by COSO.


We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Apple Computer, Inc.
as of September 30, 2006 and September 24, 2005, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2006, and
our report dated December 29, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on
those consolidated financial statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


Note
1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies


Apple Computer, Inc.
and its subsidiaries (the Company) designs, manufactures, and markets personal
computers and related software, services, peripherals, and networking solutions.
The Company also designs, develops, and markets a line of portable digital
music players along with related accessories and services including the online
distribution of third-party music, audio books, music videos, short films, and
television shows. The Company sells its products worldwide through its online
stores, its own retail stores, its direct sales force, and third-party
wholesalers, resellers, and value-added resellers. In addition to its own
hardware, software, and peripheral products, the Company sells a variety of
third-party hardware and software products through its online and retail stores.
The Company sells to education, consumer, creative professional, business, and
government customers.


Basis
of Presentation and Preparation


The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company.
Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of
these consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from
those estimates. Certain prior year amounts in the consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current
year presentation.


Typically, the Companys
fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of September. Fiscal years 2005, 2004,
and 2003 were each 52-week years. However, approximately every six years,
the Company reports a 53-week fiscal year to align its fiscal quarters
with calendar quarters by adding a week to its first fiscal quarter. The
Company will add this additional week in the first fiscal quarter of its fiscal
year 2006. All information presented herein is based on the Companys fiscal
calendar.


Common Stock Split


On February 28, 2005,
the Company effected a two-for-one stock split to shareholders of record as of February 18,
2005. All share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to
reflect the stock split.


Financial
Instruments


Cash Equivalents
and Short-term Investments


All highly liquid
investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are
classified as cash equivalents. Highly liquid investments with maturities
greater than three months are classified as short-term investments. The
Companys debt and marketable equity securities have been classified and
accounted for as available-for-sale. Management determines the
appropriate classification of its investments in debt and marketable equity
securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates available-for-sale
designation as of each balance sheet date. These securities are carried at fair
value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a
component of shareholders equity. The cost of securities sold is based upon
the specific identification method.


Derivative
Financial Instruments


The Company accounts for
its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at
fair value. Derivatives that are not defined as hedges in SFAS 133, 
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,

must be adjusted to fair value through earnings. If the derivative is a hedge,
depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value will either be
offset against the change in fair value of the


64
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 1Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies
 (Continued)


hedged assets,
liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings, or recognized in other
comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.


For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to
variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow
hedges, the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity and
reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the
hedged transaction affects earnings. To receive hedge accounting treatment,
cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected
future cash flows on hedged transactions. For derivative instruments that hedge
the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that
are designated as fair value hedges, the net gain or loss on the derivative
instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item
attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current
period. The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative
instrument that is designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency
translation exposure of the net investment in a foreign operation is reported
in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For forward
contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in
fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its
definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this
component are recognized in current earnings.


The Company may enter into
foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the translation and economic
exposure of a net investment position in a foreign subsidiary. For such
contracts, hedge effectiveness is measured based on changes in the fair value
of the contract attributable to changes in the spot exchange rate. The
effective portion of the net gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated
as a hedge of the net investment position in a foreign subsidiary is reported
in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. Any residual
changes in fair value of the forward contract, including changes in fair value
based on the differential between the spot and forward exchange rates, are
recognized in current earnings in other income and expense.


Inventories


Inventories are stated at
the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out method, or market. If
the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are made
currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. The Companys
inventories consist primarily of finished goods for all periods presented.


Property,
Plant, and Equipment


Property, plant, and
equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are 30 years for
buildings, up to 5 years for equipment, and the shorter of lease terms or 10
years for leasehold improvements. The Company capitalizes eligible costs to
acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the
preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software
are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the assets, which range from 3 to 5 years. Depreciation and amortization
expense on property and equipment was $141 million, $126 million, and $108
million during 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies (Continued)


Asset Retirement
Obligations


The Company records obligations associated with the
retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement
costs in accordance with SFAS No. 143, 
Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations
. The Company reviews legal obligations
associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the
acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. If it
is determined that a legal obligation exists, the fair value of the liability
for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is
incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of
the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this
additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. The
difference between the gross expected future cash flow and its present value is
accreted over the life of the related lease as an operating expense. All of the
Companys existing asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments
to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease
termination.


The following table
reconciles changes in the Companys asset retirement liabilities for fiscal
2004 and 2005 (in millions):

Cumulative
Effects of Accounting Changes


In 2003, the Company
recognized a net favorable cumulative effect type adjustment of approximately $1 million
from the adoption of SFAS No. 150, 
Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristic of Both Liabilities and Equity

and SFAS No. 143.


Long-Lived
Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets


The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment and
certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may
not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of
its carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected
to generate. If property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable
intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized
equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair
market value. For the three fiscal years ended September 24, 2005, the
Company had no material impairment of its long-lived assets, except for the
impairment of certain assets in connection with the restructuring actions
described in Note 5 of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.


SFAS No. 142, 
Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets
 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but rather be tested for
impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. The Company performs its
goodwill impairment tests on or about August 30 of each year. The Company
did not recognize any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in 2005,
2004, or 2003. The Company established reporting units based on its current
reporting structure. For purposes of testing goodwill for

impairment,
goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates
to each reporting unit.SFAS No. 142 also requires that intangible assets
with definite lives be amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed
for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, 
Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be
Disposed Of
. The Company is currently amortizing its acquired
intangible assets with definite lives over periods ranging from 3 to 10 years.


Foreign Currency Translation


The Company translates the
assets and liabilities of its international non-U.S. functional currency
subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each
period. Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates
that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these
translations are credited or charged to foreign currency translation included
in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders equity. The
Companys foreign manufacturing subsidiaries and certain other international
subsidiaries that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency remeasure
monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each
period, and inventories, property, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at
historical rates. Gains and losses from these translations were insignificant
and have been included in the Companys results of operations.


Revenue Recognition


Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale
of hardware, software, peripherals, digital content, and service and support
contracts. The Company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting
standards, including Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97-2, 
Software Revenue Recognition
, as amended, and Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, 
Revenue Recognition
.


The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is
fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered
delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss
have been transferred. For most of the Companys product sales, these criteria
are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals,
for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales,
the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the
Company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during
transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the
arrangement fee is not, or is presumed to not be, fixed or determinable,
revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and
payable.


Revenue from service and support contracts is deferred
and recognized ratably over the service coverage periods. These contracts
typically include extended phone support, repair services, web-based support resources,
diagnostic tools, and extend the service coverage offered under the Companys
one-year limited warranty.


The Company sells software and peripheral products
obtained from other companies. The Company establishes its own pricing and
retains related inventory risk, is the primary obligor in sales transactions
with its customers, and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its
customers. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue for the sale of products
obtained from other companies at the gross amount billed.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 1Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)


Revenue on
arrangements that include multiple elements such as hardware, software, and
services is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each
element. Each elements allocated revenue is recognized when revenue
recognition criteria for that element has been met. Fair value is generally
determined by vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE), which is based on the
price charged when each element is sold separately. 
If the Company cannot objectively determine
the fair value of any undelivered element included in a multiple-element
arrangement, the Company defers revenue until all elements are delivered and
services have been performed, or until fair value can objectively be determined
for any remaining undelivered elements. When the fair value of a delivered
element has not been established, the Company uses the residual method to
recognize revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements is
determinable. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered
elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is
allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue.


The Company records reductions to revenue for
estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive
programs, including reseller and end user rebates, and other sales programs and
volume-based incentives. The estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a
reduction to revenue in the period the Company has sold the product and
committed to a plan. The Company also records reductions to revenue for
expected future product returns based on the Companys historical experience.


Generally, the Company
does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in
connection with software sales or the sale of extended warranty and support
contracts. When the Company does offer specified upgrade rights, the Company
defers revenue for the fair value of the specified upgrade right until the
future obligation is fulfilled or when the right to the specified upgrade
expires. Additionally, a limited number of the Companys software products are
available with maintenance agreements that grant customers rights to
unspecified future upgrades over the maintenance term on a when and if
available basis. Revenue associated with such maintenance is recognized ratably
over the maintenance term.


Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts


The Company records its allowance
for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. The Company
considers historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances,
credit quality of the Companys customers, current economic conditions and
other factors that may affect customers ability to pay.


Shipping Costs


The Companys shipping and
handling costs are included in cost of sales for all periods presented.


Warranty Expense


The Company provides
currently for the estimated cost for product warranties at the time the related
revenue is recognized. The Company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting
warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual
experience and changes in future estimates.


Software Development Costs


Research and development costs are expensed as
incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or
otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a products
technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available
for general release to customers 


68
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 1Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)


pursuant to SFAS No. 86, 
Computer
Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed
. In most
instances, the Companys products are released soon after technological
feasibility has been established. Therefore, costs incurred subsequent to
achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and
generally all software development costs have been expensed.


In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company began
incurring substantial development costs associated with Mac OS X version 10.4
Tiger subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility as evidenced by
public demonstration in August 2004 and the subsequent release of a
developer beta version of the product. The Company capitalized approximately
$29.7 and $4.5 million during 2005 and 2004, respectively, of costs associated
with the development of Tiger. In accordance with SFAS No. 86, amortization
of this asset to cost of sales began in April 2005 when the Company began
shipping Tiger and is being recognized on a straight-line basis over a 3 year
estimated useful life.


During the second quarter of 2004, the Company
incurred substantial development costs associated with FileMaker Pro 7
subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility as evidenced by public
demonstration and release of a developer beta version, and prior to the release
of the final version of the product in March 2004. Therefore, during the
second quarter of 2004, the Company capitalized approximately $2.3 million of
costs associated with the development of FileMaker Pro 7. In accordance with
SFAS No. 86, amortization of this asset to cost of sales began in March 2004
when the Company began shipping FileMaker Pro 7 and is being recognized on a
straight-line basis over a 3 year estimated useful life.


During the third and fourth quarters of 2003, the
Company incurred substantial development costs associated with the development
of Mac OS X version 10.3 (code-named Panther), subsequent to achievement of
technological feasibility as evidenced by public demonstration and release of a
developer beta in June 2003, and prior to release of the final version of
the product in the first quarter of 2004. Therefore, during 2003 the Company
capitalized approximately $14.7 million of development costs associated with
the development of Panther. Amortization of this asset began in the first
quarter of 2004 when Panther was shipped and is being recognized on a
straight-line basis in accordance with SFAS No. 86 over a 3 year estimated
useful life.


Total amortization related
to capitalized software development costs was $15.7 million, $10.7 million, and
$5.8 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.


Advertising Costs


Advertising costs are
expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $287 million, $206 million, and
$193 million for 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.


Stock-Based Compensation


The Company currently measures compensation expense
for its employee stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value
method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, 
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
. The Company
applies the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123, 
Accounting
for Stock-based Compensation
, as amended by SFAS No. 148, 
Accounting for Stock-based CompensationTransition and Disclosure

as if the fair-value-based method had been applied in measuring compensation
expense. Under APB Opinion No. 25, when the exercise price of the Companys
employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the
date of the grant, no compensation expense is recognized.


69
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 1Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)


As required under
SFAS No. 123, the pro forma effects of stock-based compensation on net
income and earnings per common share for employee stock options granted and
employee stock purchase plan share purchases have been estimated at the date of
grant and beginning of the period, respectively, using a Black-Scholes
option pricing model. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair
value of the options and shares is amortized to pro forma net income over the
options vesting period and the shares plan period.

In December 2004, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), 
Share-Based Payment
, which addresses the accounting for
share-based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee
services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities
that are based on the fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that
may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. SFAS No. 123R
eliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation transactions
using the intrinsic value method under APB Opinion No. 25, and requires
instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based
method. In January 2005, the SEC issued SAB No. 107, which
provides supplemental implementation guidance for SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R
will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of its fiscal
2006. The Companys assessment of the estimated stock-based compensation
expense is affected by the Companys stock price as well as assumptions
regarding a number of complex variables and the related tax impact. These
variables include, but are not limited to, the Companys stock price,
volatility, and employee stock option exercise behaviors and the related tax
impact. The Company will recognize stock-based compensation expense on all
awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period using the
modified prospective method. Although the adoption of SFAS No. 123R is
expected to have a material effect on the Companys results of operations,
future changes to various assumptions used to determine the fair-value of
awards issued or the amount and type of equity awards granted create
uncertainty as to whether future stock-based compensation expense will be
similar to the historical SFAS No. 123 pro forma expense.

Earnings Per Common
Share


Basic earnings per common share is computed by
dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number
of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per
common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by
the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during
the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock
that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of common
stock had been issued. The dilutive effect of outstanding options, restricted stock
and restricted stock units is reflected in diluted earnings per share by
application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an
increase in the fair market value of the Companys common stock can result in a
greater dilutive effect from outstanding options, restricted stock and
restricted stock units. Additionally, the exercise of employee stock options
and the vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units can result in a
greater dilutive effect on earnings per share.

shares of common stock for the years ended September 24, 2005,
September 25, 2004, and September 27, 2003, respectively, were
excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for these periods
because their effect would have been antidilutive. These potentially dilutive
securities include stock options, restricted stock, and restricted stock units.


Comprehensive
Income


Comprehensive income
consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other
comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under
generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of
shareholders equity but are excluded from net income. The Companys other
comprehensive income is comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments
from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency,
unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as
available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative
instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges.

The Companys U.S. corporate securities consist
primarily of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, time deposits and
corporate debt securities. Foreign securities consist primarily of foreign
commercial paper, certificates of deposit and time deposits with foreign
institutions, most of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company had
net unrealized losses totaling $5.9 million on its investment portfolio,
approximately half of which related to investments with stated maturities less
than 1 year as of September 24, 2005 and net unrealized losses of $6.3
million on its investment portfolio, primarily related to investments with
stated maturities less than 1 year as of September 25, 2004. The Company
occasionally sells short-term investments prior to their stated maturities. The
Company recognized a net loss before taxes of $137,000 in 2005 and net gains
before taxes of $1 million and $21 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, as a
result of such sales. These net gains were included in interest and other
income, net.


As of September 24, 2005, approximately $287 million
of the Companys short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from
1 to 5 years. The remaining short-term investments as of September 24,
2005 had maturities of 3 to 12 months. As of September 25, 2004,
approximately $180 million of the Companys short-term investments had
underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remaining short-term
investments as of September 25, 2004 had maturities of 3 to 12 months.

Market values were
determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. The
decline in value of these investments is primarily related to changes in
interest rates and is considered to be temporary in nature. Investments are
reviewed periodically to identify possible impairment. When evaluating the
investments, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent
to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the
issuer, and the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment for a
period of time which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market
value.


Accounts Receivable


Trade Receivables


The Company distributes its products through third-party
resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and commercial
customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its
customers. However, when possible the Company does attempt to limit credit risk
on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin
America, Europe, and Asia and by arranging with third-party financing companies
to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the
Companys direct customers. These credit financing arrangements are directly
between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the
Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related
to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables that


73
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 2Financial
Instruments (Continued)


are not covered by collateral, third-party flooring
arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Companys
distribution and retail channel partners. No customer accounted for more than
10% of trade receivables as of September 24, 2005 or September 25,
2004.

Vendor Non-Trade Receivables


The Company has non-trade
receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale
of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture
sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company
purchases these raw material components directly from suppliers. These
non-trade receivables, which are included in the consolidated balance sheets in
other current assets, totaled $417 million and $276 million as of September 24,
2005 and September 25, 2004, respectively. The Company does not reflect
the sale of these components in net sales and does not recognize any profits on
these sales until the products are sold through to the end customer at which
time the profit is recognized as a reduction of cost of sales.


Derivative Financial Instruments


The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its
business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. Foreign currency
forward and option contracts are used to offset the foreign exchange risk on
certain existing assets and liabilities and to hedge the foreign exchange risk
on expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales.
From time to time, the Company enters into interest rate derivative agreements
to modify the interest rate profile of certain investments and debt. The
Companys accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether the
instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. The Company
records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.

The notional principal amounts for derivative
instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of
year-end, and do not represent the amount of the Companys exposure to credit
or market loss. The credit risk amount shown in the table above represents the
Companys gross exposure to potential accounting loss on these transactions if
all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract,
based on then-current currency exchange rates at each respective date.
The Companys exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a
function of currency exchange rates.


The estimates of fair
value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models and prevailing
financial market information as of September 24, 2005 and September 25,
2004. Although the table above reflects the notional principal, fair value, and
credit risk amounts of the Companys foreign exchange instruments, it does not
reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that
the foreign exchange instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately
realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the
gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market
conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.


Foreign Exchange
Risk Management


The Company may enter into foreign currency forward
and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign
exchange risk associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly
committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in
foreign subsidiaries. Generally, the Companys practice is to hedge a majority
of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the
Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to
immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, or
limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments.


To help protect gross margins from fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates, the Companys U.S. dollar functional
subsidiaries hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenues, and the
Companys non-U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries selling in local currencies
hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the
subsidiaries functional currency. Other comprehensive income associated with
hedges of foreign currency revenues is recognized as a component of net sales
in the same


75
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 2Financial
Instruments (Continued)


period as the related sales are recognized, and other
comprehensive income related to inventory purchases is recognized as a
component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are
recognized. Typically, the Company hedges portions of its forecasted foreign
currency exposure associated with revenues and inventory purchases over a time
horizon of 3 to 6 months.


Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges
must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable that the forecasted hedged
transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a
subsequent 2 month time period. Deferred gains and losses in other
comprehensive income associated with such derivative instruments are immediately
reclassified into earnings in other income and expense. Any subsequent changes
in fair value of such derivative instruments are also reflected in current
earnings unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. The
Company recognized net losses of $1.6 million and $2.8 million in 2005 and
2004, respectively, in other income and expense related to the loss of hedge
designation on discontinued cash flow hedges due to changes in the Companys
forecast of future net sales and cost of sales and due to prevailing market
conditions. No net gains, or losses, of a similar nature were recorded in 2003.
As of September 24, 2005, the Company had a net deferred gain associated
with cash flow hedges of approximately $3.6 million, net of taxes, substantially
all of which is expected to be reclassified to earnings by the end of the
second quarter of fiscal 2006.


The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a
derivative instrument designated as a net investment hedge is included in the
cumulative translation adjustment account of accumulated other comprehensive
income within shareholders equity. As of September 24, 2005 and
September 25, 2004, the Company had a net gain of $673,000 and a net loss
of $1.8 million, respectively, included in the cumulative translation
adjustment.


The Company may also enter
into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign
exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and
liabilities recorded in non-functional currencies. Changes in the fair value of
these derivatives are recognized in current earnings in other income and
expense as offsets to the changes in the fair value of the related assets or
liabilities. Due to currency market movements, changes in option time value can
lead to increased volatility in other income and expense.


Interest Rate Risk
Management


From time to time, the Company historically entered
into interest rate derivative transactions with financial institutions in order
to better match the Companys floating-rate interest income on its cash
equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on
any outstanding long-term debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the Companys
exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates.


During 2001 and 2002, the Company entered into and
then subsequently terminated various interest rate debt swap agreements
generating a realized gain of $23 million. These gains were deferred and
amortized over the remaining life of the underlying debt, which matured and was
repaid in February 2004.


As of September 24,
2005 and September 25, 2004, the Company had no interest rate derivatives
outstanding.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company
recorded an adjustment of approximately $11 million to goodwill relating to a
reduction of valuation allowances that were recorded at the time certain net
operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) were acquired in previous business
combinations. During the fourth quarter of 2005, these NOLs were deemed to be
more likely than not to be realized and accordingly the valuation allowances
were reversed against the related goodwill that was recognized at the time of
the acquisitions.


During the third quarter of 2004, the Company recorded
an adjustment of approximately $5 million to goodwill related to the
acquisition of PowerSchool, Inc. (PowerSchool) in 2001. This reduction of
goodwill included the cancellation of 158,334 shares of the Companys common stock,
valued at approximately $2 million, that were previously held in escrow
and were refunded upon resolution of certain matters arising out of the
acquisition of PowerSchool. This adjustment also included approximately $3
million to adjust the original estimates of the pre-acquisition PowerSchool
restructuring liability to actual costs incurred.

to write-off deferred compensation, $7.1 million in asset impairments,
and a $7.3 million charge for lease cancellations primarily related to the
closure of the Companys Singapore manufacturing operations during the first
quarter of 2003. Of the $26.8 million charge, all had been utilized by the end
of 2005, except for approximately $1.7 million related to operating lease costs
on abandoned facilities. During the third quarter of 2003, approximately
$500,000 of the amount originally accrued for lease cancellations was
determined to be in excess due to the sublease of a property sooner than originally
expected and 
a shortfall

The foreign provision for income taxes is based on
foreign pretax earnings of approximately $922 million, $384 million, and $250
million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. As of September 24, 2005,
approximately $4.3 billion of the Companys cash, cash equivalents, and short-term
investments were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S.
dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are
generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. The
Companys consolidated financial statements fully provide for any related tax
liability on amounts that may be repatriated, aside from undistributed earnings
of certain of the Companys foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be
indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the U.S. U.S. income taxes have
not been provided on a cumulative total of $1.2 billion of such earnings. It is
not practicable to determine the income tax liability that might be incurred if
these earnings were to be distributed.

Note 6Income

 (Continued)


On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation
Act (AJCA) was signed into law. The AJCA includes a provision for the deduction
of 85% of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated, as defined in the
AJCA. The legislation provided the Company with the option to apply this
provision to repatriations of qualifying earnings in either 2005 or 2006. The
Company is continuing to evaluate the effects of the repatriation provision and
expects to complete the evaluation in 2006. A maximum of $755 million may be
eligible for repatriation under the reduced tax rate provided by AJCA. However,
given the uncertainties and complexities of the repatriation provision and the
Companys continuing evaluation, the Company has not yet determined the amount
that may be repatriated or the related potential income tax effects of such
repatriation.


Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the
effects of tax losses, credits, and the future income tax effects of temporary
differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured
using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

As of September 24, 2005, the Company had
operating loss carryforwards for federal tax purposes of approximately
$62 million, which expire from 2011 through 2024. A portion of these
carryforwards was acquired from the Companys previous acquisitions, the
utilization of which is subject to certain limitations imposed by the Internal
Revenue Code. The Company also has Federal credit carryforwards and various
state and foreign tax loss and credit carryforwards, the tax effect of which is
approximately $206 million and which expire between 2010 and 2025. The
remaining benefits from tax losses and credits do not expire. As of September 24,
2005 and September 25, 2004, a valuation allowance of $5 million and $30
million, respectively, was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the
benefits of tax losses that may not be realized. The remaining valuation
allowance relates principally to the state operating losses. Management
believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income
that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together
with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to
fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets.

During 2005, the Company reversed certain tax
contingency reserves and recorded a corresponding benefit to income tax expense
primarily as a result of a change in the estimated outcome of certain tax
disputes. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company recorded
a benefit to tax expense to adjust its net deferred tax assets as a result of
the Companys year-end review of its deferred tax accounts, the impact of which
was not material to the current or prior periods results of operations. The
total benefit to income tax expense from the reversal of these tax contingency
reserves and adjustments to net deferred tax assets was $67 million. The
Company also recorded a $14 million credit to income tax expense resulting from
a reduction of the valuation allowance.


The Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) has completed its field audit of the Companys federal income tax
returns for all years prior to 2002 and proposed certain adjustments. Certain
of these adjustments are being contested through the IRS Appeals Office. Substantially
all IRS audit issues for these years have been resolved. In addition, the
Company is also subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities.
Management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments
that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits
cannot be predicted with certainty. Should any issues addressed in the Companys
tax audits be resolved in a manner not consistent with managements
expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income
tax in the period such resolution occurs.


Note 7Shareholders Equity

Restricted Stock Units


During 2005 and 2004, the
Companys Board of Directors approved the grant of 230,000 and 5.03 million
restricted stock units, respectively, to members of the Companys senior
management team, excluding its CEO. These restricted stock units generally vest
over four years either in two equal installments on the second and fourth
anniversaries of the date of grant or in equal installments on each of the
first through fourth anniversaries of the grant date. Upon vesting, the
restricted stock units will convert into an equivalent number of shares of
common stock. The Company has recorded $10.3 million and $64.4 million in 2005
and 2004, respectively, in value for these restricted stock units as a component
of shareholders equity and is amortizing the amounts on a straight-line basis
over the four-year requisite service period. The value of the restricted stock
units was based on the closing market price of the Companys common stock on
the date of grant. The restricted stock units have been included in the
calculation of diluted earnings per share utilizing the treasury stock method.


CEO Restricted Stock Award


On March 19, 2003, the Company entered into an
Option Cancellation and Restricted Stock Award Agreement (the Agreement) with Mr. Steven
P. Jobs, its CEO. The Agreement cancelled stock option awards for the purchase
of 55 million shares of the Companys common stock previously granted to Mr. Jobs
in 2000 and 2001. Mr. Jobs retained options to purchase 120,000 shares of
the Companys common stock granted in August of 1997 in his capacity as a
member of the Companys Board of Directors, prior to becoming the Companys CEO.
The Agreement replaced the cancelled options with a restricted stock award of 10
million shares of the Companys common stock. The restricted stock award
generally vests three years from the date of grant. Vesting of some or all of
the restricted shares will be accelerated in the event Mr. Jobs is
terminated without cause, dies, or has his management role reduced following a
change in control of the Company.


The Company determined the
value of the restricted stock award in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25
and has recorded the value as deferred stock compensation as a component of shareholders
equity and is amortizing that amount on a straight-line basis over the 3 year
service period. The value of the restricted stock award was based on the
closing market price of the Companys common stock on the date of the award.
The 10 million restricted shares have been included in the calculation of
diluted earnings per share utilizing the treasury stock method.


Stock Repurchase Plan


In July 1999, the Companys Board of Directors
authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its
common stock. This repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any
specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time.


During the fourth quarter
of 2001, the Company entered into a forward purchase agreement to acquire
3.1 million shares of its common stock in September of 2003 at an
average price of $8.32 per share for a total cost of $25.5 million. In August 2003,
the Company settled this agreement prior to its maturity, at which time the
Companys common stock had a fair value of $11.41. Other than this forward
purchase transaction, the Company has not engaged in any transactions to
repurchase its common stock since 2000. Since inception of the stock repurchase
plan, the Company had repurchased a total of 13.1 million shares at a cost of
$217 million. The Company was authorized to repurchase up to an additional $283
million of its common stock as of September 24, 2005.

Comprehensive Income


Comprehensive income consists of two components, net
income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to
revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders equity but
are excluded from net income. The Companys other comprehensive income consists
of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using
the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on
marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains
and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges.

Note 8Employee Benefit Plans


2003 Employee Stock Plan


The 2003 Employee Stock
Plan (the 2003 Plan) is a shareholder approved plan that provides for broad-based
grants to employees, including executive officers. Based on the terms of
individual option grants, options granted under the 2003 Plan generally expire
7 to 10 years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a
period of 4 years, based on continued employment, with either annual or
quarterly vesting. The 2003 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock
options, nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock units, stock appreciation
rights, and stock purchase rights.


1997 Employee Stock Option Plan


In August 1997, the
Companys Board of Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the
1997 Plan), a non-shareholder approved plan for grants of stock options to
employees who are not officers of the Company. Based on the terms of individual
option grants, options granted under the 1997 Plan generally expire 7 to 10
years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of
4 years, based on continued employment, with either annual or quarterly
vesting. In October 2003, the Company terminated the 1997 Employee Stock
Option Plan and cancelled all remaining unissued shares totaling 28,590,702.  No new options can be granted from the 1997
Plan.


Employee Stock Option Exchange Program


On March 20, 2003,
the Company announced a voluntary employee stock option exchange program (the
Exchange Program) whereby eligible employees, other than executive officers and
members of the Board of Directors, had an opportunity to exchange outstanding
options with exercise prices at or above $12.50 per share for a
predetermined smaller number of new stock options issued with exercise prices
equal to the fair market value of one share of the Companys common stock on
the day the new awards were issued, which was to be at least six months plus
one day after the exchange options were cancelled. On April 17, 2003, in accordance
with the Exchange Program, the Company cancelled options to purchase 33,138,386
shares of its common stock. On October 22, 2003, new stock options
totaling 13,394,736 shares were issued to employees at an exercise price of
$11.38 per share, which is equivalent to the closing price of the Companys
stock on that date. No financial or accounting impact to the Companys
financial position, results of operations or cash flow was associated with this
transaction.


1997 Director Stock Option Plan


In August 1997, the
Companys Board of Directors adopted a shareholder approved Director Stock
Option Plan (DSOP) for non-employee directors of the Company. Initial grants of
30,000 options under the DSOP vest in three equal installments on each of the
first through third anniversaries of the date of grant, and subsequent annual
grants of 10,000 options are fully vested at grant.


Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans


Certain of the Companys
executive officers, including Mr. Timothy D. Cook, Mr. Peter
Oppenheimer, Mr. Jonathan Rubinstein, Mr. Philip W. Schiller, Dr. Bertrand
Serlet, and Dr. Avadis Tevanian, Jr., have entered into trading plans
pursuant to Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended. A trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the
amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and
dates) of future purchases or sales of the Companys stock including the
exercise and sale of employee stock options and shares acquired pursuant to the
Companys employee stock purchase plan and upon vesting of restricted stock
units.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 8Employee
Benefit Plans
 (Continued)


Employee Stock Purchase Plan


The Company has a
shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan (the Purchase Plan), under
which substantially all employees may purchase common stock through payroll
deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values as of
the beginning and end of six month offering periods. Stock purchases under the
Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of an employees compensation, up to a maximum
of $25,000 in any calendar year. Beginning with the six-month offering period
that started on June 30, 2003, the number of shares authorized for
issuance is limited to a total of 1 million shares per offering period. During
2005, 2004, and 2003, adjusted for the February 2005 stock split 2.3
million, 3.9 million, and 4.3 million shares, respectively, were issued under
the Purchase Plan. As of September 24, 2005, approximately 3.8 million
shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan.


Employee Savings Plan


The Company has an
employee savings plan (the Savings Plan) qualifying as a deferred salary
arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under
the Savings Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their
pre-tax earnings, up to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limit
($14,000 for calendar year 2005). The Company matches 50% to 100% of each
employees contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of
the employees earnings. The Companys matching contributions to the Savings
Plan were approximately $28 million, $24 million, and $21 million in 2005,
2004, and 2003, respectively.

Note 9Stock-Based
Compensation


The Company has provided pro forma disclosures in Note
1 of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the effect on net
income and earnings per share as if the fair value method of accounting for
stock compensation had been used for its employee stock option grants and
employee stock purchase plan purchases. These pro forma effects have been
estimated at the date of grant and beginning of the period, respectively, using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model.


For purposes of the pro forma disclosures provided
pursuant to SFAS No. 123, the option awards issued in October 2003
and the awards cancelled as part of the Employee Stock Option Exchange Program
have been accounted for using modification accounting. In accordance with SFAS
No. 123, the grant date of the awards issued is the date of acceptance of
the exchange offer by participating employees. The cancellation of certain of
the Companys CEOs options and replacement with restricted shares in
March 2003 is also being accounted for using modification accounting for
purposes of the pro forma disclosures provided pursuant to SFAS No. 123.

For purposes of the pro

volatility assumptions used by the Company are based on the historical
volatility of the Companys common stock over the most recent period
commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Companys stock options
and other relevant factors including implied volatility in market traded
options on the Companys common stock and the impact of unusual fluctuations
not reasonably expected to recur on the historical volatility of the Companys
common stock. The Company bases its expected life assumption on its historical
experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock options it grants to
employees.


Note 10Commitments and Contingencies


Lease Commitments


The Company leases various equipment and facilities,
including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The
Company does not currently utilize any other off-balance-sheet financing
arrangements. The major facility leases are for terms of 5 to 15 years and
generally provide renewal options for terms of 3 to 5 additional years. Leases
for retail space are for terms of 5 to 20 years, the majority of which are for
10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of September 24,
2005, the Companys total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable
operating leases were $865 million, of which $606 million related to leases for
retail space.

Accrued
Warranty and Indemnifications


The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor
warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period for hardware products
is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. The Company
also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair
the Companys hardware products. The Company provides currently for the
estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product warranties
at the time related revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining
appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the
installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical and
projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and
knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Companys
typical experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting
warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual
experience and changes in future estimates.

not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software
against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual
property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include
indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs
and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an
indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any
significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against
itself or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does
not have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims
subject to indemnification that would have a material adverse effect on its
financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Therefore, the Company
did not record a liability for infringement costs as of either September 24,
2005 or September 25, 2004.

Note 10Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)


Concentrations in
the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product


Although most components
essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple
sources, other key components (including microprocessors and application-specific
integrated circuits (ASICs)) are currently obtained by the Company from
single or limited sources. Some other key components, while currently available
to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide
availability and pricing pressures. In addition, the Company uses some
components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry,
and new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom
components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated
whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers. If
the supply of a key single-sourced component to the Company were to be
delayed or curtailed, or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays
shipments of completed products to the Company, the Companys ability to ship
related products in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be
adversely affected. The Companys business and financial performance could also
be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient
quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient
quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these
components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the
production of common components instead of components customized to meet the
Companys requirements. Finally, significant portions of the Companys CPUs,
logic boards, and assembled products are now manufactured by outsourcing
partners, primarily in various parts of Asia. Although the Company works
closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Companys
operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were
unable to meet their production obligations.


Long-Term Supply Agreements


Subsequent to September 24,
2005, the Company entered into long-term supply agreements with Hynix
Semiconductor, Inc., Intel Corporation, Micron Technology, Inc.,
Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and Toshiba Corporation to secure supply of NAND
flash memory through calendar year 2010. As part of these agreements, the
Company intends to prepay a total of $1.25 billion for flash memory components
by the end of the second quarter of 2006.


Contingencies


The Company is subject to
certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary
course of business and have not been fully adjudicated. In the opinion of
management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any
current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the
aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity,
or results of operations. However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be
predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these
legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the
Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular
reporting period could be materially adversely affected.


Production and marketing
of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to
environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the
requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of
its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or
recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been passed
in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates including various
European Union member countries, Japan and certain states within the U.S. Although
the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future
based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no
assurance that 


91
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 10Commitments
and Contingencies (Continued)


such existing laws or
future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial
condition, liquidity, or results of operations.


Note 11Segment Information and Geographic Data


In accordance with SFAS No. 131, 
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information
,
the Company reports segment information based on the management approach. The
management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for
making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Companys
reportable segments.


The Company manages its business primarily on a
geographic basis. The Companys reportable operating segments are comprised of
the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas, Europe, and Japan
reportable segments do not include activities related to the Retail segment. The
Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment
includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Retail
segment operates Apple-owned retail stores in the U.S., Canada, Japan, and the
U.K. Other operating segments include Asia-Pacific, which includes Australia
and Asia except for Japan, and the Companys subsidiary, FileMaker, Inc. Each
reportable geographic operating segment provides similar hardware and software
products and similar services, and the accounting policies of the various
segments are the same as those described in Note 1, Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies, except as described below for the Retail segment.


The Company evaluates the performance of its operating
segments based on net sales. The Retail segments performance is also evaluated
based on operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally
based on the location of the customers. Operating income for each segment
includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating
expenses directly attributable to the segment. Operating income for each
segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses that are managed
outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income
include various corporate expenses, manufacturing costs and variances not
included in standard costs, income taxes, and various nonrecurring charges.
Corporate expenses include research and development, corporate marketing
expenses, manufacturing costs and variances not included in standard costs, and
other separately managed general and administrative expenses including certain
corporate expenses associated with support of the Retail segment. The Company
does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management
reporting purposes. Segment assets exclude corporate assets. Corporate assets
include cash, short-term and long-term investments, manufacturing facilities, miscellaneous
corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets, and
retail store construction-in-progress that is not subject to depreciation.
Except for the Retail segment, capital expenditures for long-lived assets are
not reported to management by segment. Capital expenditures by the Retail
segment were $132 million, $104 million, and $92 million for 2005, 2004, and
2003 respectively.


Operating income for all segments, except Retail,
includes cost of sales at manufacturing standard cost, other cost of sales,
related sales and marketing costs, and certain general and administrative
costs. This measure of operating income, which includes manufacturing profit,
provides a comparable basis for comparison between the Companys various geographic
segments. Certain manufacturing expenses and related adjustments not included
in segment cost of sales, including variances between standard and actual
manufacturing costs and the mark-up above standard cost for product supplied to
the Retail segment, are included in corporate expenses.


92
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 11Segment
Information and Geographic Data
 (Continued)


Management assesses the operating performance of the
Retail segment differently than it assesses the operating performance of the
Companys geographic segments. The Retail segment revenue and operating income
is intended to depict a measure comparable to that of the Companys major
channel partners in the U.S. operating retail stores so the Company can
evaluate the Retail segment performance as if it were a channel partner.
Therefore, the Company makes three significant adjustments to the Retail
segment for management reporting purposes that are not included in the results
of the Companys other segments.


First, the Retail segments operating income includes
cost of sales for Apple products at an amount normally charged to major channel
partners in the U.S. operating retail stores, less the cost of sales programs
and incentives provided to those channel partners and the Companys cost to
support those partners. For the years ended September 24, 2005, September 25,
2004, and September 27, 2003, this resulted in the recognition of
additional cost of sales above standard cost by the Retail segment and an
offsetting benefit to corporate expenses of approximately $435 million, $213
million, and $106 million, respectively.


Second, the Companys service and support contracts
are transferred to the Retail segment at the same cost as that charged to the
Companys major retail channel partners in the U.S., resulting in a measure of
revenue and gross margin for those items that is comparable between the Companys
Retail stores and those retail channel partners. The Retail segment recognizes
the full amount of revenue and cost of sales of the Companys service and
support contracts at the time of sale. Because the Company has not yet earned
the revenue or incurred the costs associated with the sale of these contracts,
an offset to these amounts is recognized in other operating segments net sales
and cost of sales. For the year ended September 24, 2005, this resulted in
the recognition of net sales and cost of sales by the Retail segment, with
corresponding offsets in other operating segments, of $92 million and $64
million, respectively. For the year ended September 25, 2004, the net
sales and cost of sales recognized by the Retail segment for sales of service
and support contracts were $54 million and $37 million, respectively. For the
year ended September 27, 2003, this resulted in the recognition of net
sales and cost of sales by the Retail segment of $30 million and $20 million,
respectively.


Third, the Company has opened seven high profile
stores in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Tokyo, Japan, Osaka,
Japan, and London, England as of September 24, 2005. These high profile
stores are larger than the Companys typical retail stores and were designed to
further promote brand awareness and provide a venue for certain corporate sales
and marketing activities, including corporate briefings. As such, the Company
allocates certain operating expenses associated with these stores to corporate
marketing expense to reflect the estimated benefit realized Company-wide. The
allocation of these operating costs is based on the amount incurred for a high
profile store in excess of that incurred by a more typical Company retail
location. Expenses allocated to corporate marketing resulting from the
operations of these stores were $31 million, $16 million, and $6 million for
the years ended September 24, 2005, September 25, 2004, and September 27,
2003, respectively.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


The
Board of Directors and Shareholders


Apple Computer, Inc.:


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Apple Computer, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 24,
2005 and September 25, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended September 24, 2005. These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.


We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.


In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of September 24, 2005 and September 25,
2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended September 24, 2005, in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.


We also have audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 24,
2005, based on criteria established in 
Internal
Control-Integrated Framework 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated November 29,
2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment of, and the
effective operation of internal control over financial reporting.


As discussed in Note 1 to
the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of
accounting for asset retirement obligations and for financial instruments with
characteristics of both liabilities and equity in 2003.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


The Board of Directors and Shareholders


Apple Computer, Inc.:


We have audited managements assessment, included in
the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting, that Apple Computer, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2005, based
on criteria established in 
Internal
Control-Integrated Framework 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Apple Computer, Inc.s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of Apple
Computer, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.


We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.


A companys internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.


Because of inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


In our opinion, managements assessment that Apple
Computer, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of September 24, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects,
based on criteria established in 
Internal
Control-Integrated Framework 
issued by COSO. Also, in our opinion, Apple
Computer, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of September 24, 2005, based on criteria
established in 
Internal Control-Integrated Framework 
issued
by COSO.


We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Apple Computer, Inc. as of September 24,
2005 and September 25, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended September 24, 2005, and our report dated November 29,
2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 
Apple Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively Apple or the Company) design, manufacture, and market personal computers, mobile communication devices, and portable
digital music and video players and sell a variety of related software, third-party digital content and applications, services, peripherals, and networking solutions. The Company sells its products worldwide through its online stores, its retail
stores, its direct sales force, and third-party wholesalers, resellers and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Macintosh (Mac), iPhone and iPod compatible products including application
software, printers, storage devices, speakers, headphones, and various other accessories and supplies through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to consumer, small and mid-sized business (SMB), education, enterprise,
government and creative customers. 
 
Basis of Presentation and Preparation 
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these
consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements
and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 
 
Certain prior year amounts in the
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current years presentation. During the first quarter of 2009, the Company reclassified $2.4 billion of certain fixed-income securities from
short-term marketable securities to long-term marketable securities in the September 27, 2008 Consolidated Balance Sheet. The reclassification resulted from a change in accounting presentation for certain investments based on contractual
maturity dates, which more closely reflects the Companys assessment of the timing of when such securities will be converted to cash. As a result of this change, marketable securities with maturities less than 12 months are classified as
short-term and marketable securities with maturities greater than 12 months are classified as long-term. There have been no changes in the Companys investment policies or practices associated with this change in accounting presentation. See
Note 2, Financial Instruments of this Form 10-K for additional information. 
 
The Companys fiscal year is the
52 or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Companys fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007 ended on September 26, 2009, September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007, respectively, and included 52 weeks
each. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter approximately every six years to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years or quarters refer to the Companys fiscal
years ended in September and the associated quarters of those fiscal years. 
 
In May 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) established general accounting standards and disclosure for subsequent events. The Company adopted FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 855,
 Subsequent Events 
(formerly referenced as
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 165, 
Subsequent Events
), during the third quarter of 2009. The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the date and time the financial statements were issued on
October 27, 2009. 
 
Financial Instruments 
 
Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities 
 
All highly liquid investments
with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. The Companys debt and marketable equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. Management determines the
appropriate classification of its investments in debt securities at

Table of Contents



the time of purchase and reevaluates the available-for-sale designations as of each balance sheet date. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term
based on each instruments underlying contractual maturity date. Marketable securities with maturities of less than 12 months are classified as short-term and marketable securities with maturities greater than 12 months are classified as
long-term. These securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of shareholders equity. The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method.

 
Derivative Financial Instruments 
 
During the second quarter of 2009, the Company adopted FASB ASC 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging
 (formerly referenced as SFAS No. 161, 
Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities  an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133
), which requires additional disclosures about the Companys objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments, how the derivative instruments and related hedged items
are accounted for, and how the derivative instruments and related hedged item affect the financial statements. 
 
The Company
accounts for its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value. Derivatives that are not defined as hedges must be adjusted to fair value through earnings. 
 
For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges, the
effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged
transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in current earnings. To receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to
expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments that hedge
the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that are designated as fair value hedges, the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged
risk are recognized in earnings in the current period. The Company did not have a net gain or loss on these derivative instruments during 2009, 2008 and 2007. The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is
designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure of the net investment in a foreign operation is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For forward exchange contracts designated as net
investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this component are recognized in current earnings.

 
Fair Value Measurements 
 
During the first quarter of 2009, the Company adopted FASB ASC 820, 
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures 
(formerly referenced as SFAS No. 157, 
Fair Value Measurements
), which
defines fair value, establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. This new accounting standard does not require any new fair value measurements. The Company applies fair value accounting
for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received
from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair
value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent
risk, transfer restrictions and credit risk. 
 
During the first quarter of 2009, the Company adopted FASB ASC
825, 
Financial Instruments
 (formerly referenced as SFAS No. 159, 
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  Including


 
 


60 






Table of Contents




an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115
)
,
 which allows companies to choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not required
to be measured at fair value. The Company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments. 
 
Inventories 


 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out method, or market. If the cost of the
inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. The Companys inventories consist primarily of finished goods for all periods presented. 
 
Property, Plant and Equipment 
 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the
underlying building, up to five years for equipment, and the shorter of lease terms or ten years for leasehold improvements. The Company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the
preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. Depreciation and amortization expense on
property and equipment was $577 million, $363 million and $249 million during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 
 
Asset Retirement
Obligations 
 
The Company records obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the
associated asset retirement costs. The Company reviews legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. If it is determined that a
legal obligation exists, the fair value of the liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of the liability is added to the
carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. The difference between the gross expected future cash flow and its present value is accreted over the life of the related lease as
an operating expense. All of the Companys existing asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. The Companys asset retirement
liability was $25 million and $21 million as of September 26, 2009 and September 27, 2008, respectively. 
 
Long-Lived Assets
Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets 
 
The Company reviews property, plant and equipment and certain
identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets
is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property, plant and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be
recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. The Company did not record any material impairments during 2009, 2008 and 2007. 
 
The Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, rather such assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. The Company performs its goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests on or about August 31 of each year. The Company did not recognize any goodwill or
intangible asset impairment charges in 2009, 2008 and 2007. The Company established reporting units based on its current reporting structure. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to
the extent it relates to each reporting unit.

The Company amortizes its intangible assets with definite lives over their estimated useful
lives and reviews these assets for impairment. The Company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods ranging from one to ten years. 
 
Foreign Currency Translation and Remeasurement 
 
The Company translates the
assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those
in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are credited or charged to foreign currency translation included in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity. The Companys subsidiaries that use
the U.S. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and inventories, property, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. Gains and losses
from these remeasurements were insignificant and have been included in the Companys results of operations. 
 
Revenue Recognition 


 
Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, peripherals, and
service and support contracts. For any product within these groups that either is software, or is considered software-related (e.g., Mac computers, iPhones and iPod portable digital music and video players), the Company accounts for such products in
accordance with the specific industry accounting guidance for software and software related transactions. The Company applies various revenue-related GAAP for products that are not software or software-related, such as digital content sold on the
iTunes Store and certain Mac, iPhone and iPod supplies and accessories, which is described below. 
 
The Company recognizes
revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of
loss have been transferred. For most of the Companys product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the
Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is not, or
is presumed not to be, fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met. 
 
Revenue from service and support contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the service coverage periods. These contracts typically include extended phone support, repair
services, web-based support resources, diagnostic tools, and extend the service coverage offered under the Companys standard limited warranty. 
 
The Company sells software and peripheral products obtained from other companies. The Company generally establishes its own pricing and retains related inventory risk, is the primary obligor in sales
transactions with its customers, and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. Accordingly, the Company generally recognizes revenue for the sale of products obtained from other companies based on the gross amount billed.

 
The Company accounts for multiple element arrangements that consist only of software or software-related products in
accordance with industry specific accounting guidance for software and software related transactions. If a multiple-element arrangement includes deliverables that are neither software nor software-related, the Company applies various revenue-related
GAAP to determine if those deliverables constitute separate units of accounting from the software or software-related deliverables. If the Company can separate the deliverables, the Company applies the industry specific accounting guidance to the
software and software-related deliverables and applies other appropriate guidance to the non-software related deliverables. Revenue on arrangements that include multiple elements such as hardware, software and services is allocated to each element
based on the

 
 


62 






Table of Contents



relative fair value of each element. Each elements allocated revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met. Fair value is generally determined
by vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE), which is based on the price charged when each element is sold separately. If the Company cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in a multiple-element
arrangement, the Company defers revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been performed, or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements. When the fair value of a delivered element has not
been established, but fair value exists for the undelivered elements, the Company uses the residual method to recognize revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements is determinable. Under the residual method, the fair value of the
undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue. 
 
For both iPhone and Apple TV, the Company has indicated it may from time-to-time provide future unspecified features and additional software products free of charge to customers. Accordingly, iPhone
handsets and Apple TV sales are accounted for under subscription accounting in accordance with GAAP. As such, the revenue and associated cost of sales are deferred at the time of sale, and are both recognized on a straight-line basis over the
currently estimated 24-month economic life of these products, with any loss recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred by the Company for engineering, sales, marketing and warranty are expensed as incurred. 
 
The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs,
including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. The estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue in the period the Company has sold the product and committed to a plan. The
Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Companys historical experience. Revenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the
collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority. 
 
Generally, the Company
does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales or the sale of extended warranty and support contracts. When the Company does offer specified upgrade rights, the Company defers revenue for
the fair value of the specified upgrade right until the future obligation is fulfilled or the right to the specified upgrade expires. A limited number of the Companys software products are available with maintenance agreements that grant
customers rights to unspecified future upgrades over the maintenance term on a when and if available basis. Revenue associated with such maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term. 
 
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
 
The Company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. The Company considers historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of the Companys customers,
current economic conditions, and other factors that may affect customers ability to pay. 
 
Shipping Costs 
 
For all periods presented, amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue, and the Companys
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales. 
 
Warranty Expense 
 
The Company generally provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. The Company assesses the adequacy of its
preexisting warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates. For products accounted for under subscription accounting, the Company recognizes warranty expense as incurred.

Software Development Costs 
 
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when
a products technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. In most instances, the Companys products are released soon after technological feasibility has been
established. Therefore, costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally most software development costs have been expensed. 
 
In 2009 and 2008, the Company capitalized $71 million and $11 million, respectively, of costs associated with the development of Mac OS X Version 10.6 Snow Leopard (Mac OS X
Snow Leopard), which was released during the fourth quarter of 2009. During 2007, the Company capitalized $75 million of costs associated with the development of Mac OS X Version 10.5 Leopard (Mac OS X Leopard) and iPhone software.
The capitalized costs are being amortized to cost of sales on a straight-line basis over a three year estimated useful life of the underlying technology.
 
Total amortization related to capitalized software development costs was $25 million, $27 million and $13 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 
 
Advertising Costs 
 
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $501 million, $486 million and $467 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 
 
Stock-Based Compensation 
 
The Company accounts for stock-based payment
transactions in which the Company receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by
the issuance of such equity instruments. Stock-based compensation cost for restricted stock units (RSUs) is measured based on the closing fair market value of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation
cost for stock options is estimated at the grant date based on each options fair-value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) option-pricing model. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation cost as expense ratably on
a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company will recognize a benefit from stock-based compensation in equity if an incremental tax benefit is realized by following the ordering provisions of the tax law. In addition, the
Company accounts for the indirect effects of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit, the foreign tax credit and the domestic manufacturing deduction through the income statement. Further information regarding stock-based compensation
can be found in Note 7, Shareholders Equity and Stock-Based Compensation. 
 
Income Taxes 
 
The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the
amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. 
 
During 2008, the Company adopted FASB Accounting Standards
Codification (ASC) 740,
 Income Taxes 
(formerly referenced as FASB Financial Interpretation No. 48, 
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an


 
 


64 






Table of Contents




interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109)
, which changed the framework for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax
position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are
then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. See Note 6, Income Taxes for additional information, including the effects of adoption on the Companys
consolidated financial statements. 
 
Earnings Per Common Share 
 
Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of
common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued. Potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options, shares to be purchased under the employee stock purchase plan and unvested RSUs.
The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted earnings per common share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the Companys common
stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities. 
 
The following table sets forth the
computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share for the three years ended September 26, 2009 (in thousands, except net income in millions and per share amounts):

Potentially dilutive securities representing 12.6 million, 10.3 million and
13.7 million shares of common stock for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share for these periods because their effect would have been antidilutive. 
 
Comprehensive Income 
 
Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under GAAP are recorded as an element of shareholders equity but
are excluded from net income. The Companys other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on
marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges. 
 
Segment Information 
 
The Company reports segment information based on the
management approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Companys reportable segments. Information about the
Companys products, major customers and geographic areas on a company-wide basis is also disclosed.

During the first quarter of 2009, the Company changed its accounting presentation for
certain fixed-income investments, which resulted in the reclassification of certain investments from short-term marketable securities to long-term marketable securities. As a result, prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the
current years presentation. The Company classifies its marketable securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instruments underlying contractual maturity date, while its prior classifications were based on the nature of
the securities and their availability for use in current operations. As a result of this change, marketable securities with maturities of less than 12 months are classified as short-term and marketable securities with maturities greater than 12
months are classified as long-term. The Companys long-term marketable securities maturities range from one year to five years. The Company believes this new presentation is preferable as it more closely reflects the Companys
assessment of the timing of when such securities will be converted to cash. Accordingly, certain fixed-income investments totaling $2.4 billion have been reclassified from short-term marketable securities to long-term marketable securities in
the September 27, 2008 Consolidated Balance Sheet to conform to the current years financial statement presentation. There have been no changes in the Companys investment policies or practices associated with this change in
accounting presentation.

The Company had net unrealized gains on its investment portfolio of $57 million as of
September 26, 2009 and net unrealized losses on its investment portfolio of $117 million as of September 27, 2008. The net unrealized gains as of September 26, 2009 and the net unrealized losses as of September 27, 2008 related
primarily to long-term marketable securities. The Company may sell certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. The Company
recognized no material net gains or losses during 2009, 2008 and 2007 related to such sales.

Table of Contents


The Company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment
portfolio to be temporary in nature. The unrealized losses on the Companys marketable securities were caused primarily by changes in market interest rates, specifically, widening credit spreads. The Company typically invests in highly-rated
securities, and its policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Companys investment policy requires investments to be investment grade, primarily rated single-A or better, with the objective of minimizing the
potential risk of principal loss. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating the investments for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and
extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the Companys intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell, the investment before
recovery of the investments amortized cost basis. During the years ended September 26, 2009 and September 27, 2008, the Company did not recognize any material impairment charges. As of September 26, 2009, the Company does not
consider any of its investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired. 
 
Derivative Financial Instruments 
 
The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. The Company may enter into foreign
currency forward and option contracts to offset some of the foreign exchange risk of expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales, of net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and on certain existing assets and
liabilities. To help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Companys subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar, hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue. The
Companys subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar and who sell in local currencies, may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries functional currencies. The Company
typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases for three to six months. To help protect the net investment in a foreign operation from adverse changes in foreign currency
exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company may also enter into
foreign currency forward and option contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. However, the Company may
choose not to hedge certain foreign currency exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to immateriality, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no
assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 
The Companys accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. The Company records all derivatives on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets at fair value. The effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in other comprehensive
income as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments and the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges and net investment hedges are adjusted to fair value through earnings in other
income and expense. 
 
The Company had a net deferred gain associated with cash flow hedges of approximately $31 million and $19
million, net of taxes, recorded in other comprehensive income as of September 26, 2009 and September 27, 2008, respectively. Other comprehensive income associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue is recognized as a
component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and other comprehensive income related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases is recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs
are recognized. The portion of the Companys net deferred gain related to products under subscription accounting is expected to be recorded in earnings ratably over the related products estimated economic lives beginning when the hedged
transactions occur, while the portion of the net deferred gain related to other products is expected to be recorded in earnings at the time the hedged transactions occur. As of September 26, 2009, the hedged transactions are expected to occur
within six months.

Table of Contents


Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when
it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two month time period. Deferred gains and losses in other comprehensive income associated with such derivative instruments
are reclassified immediately into earnings through other income and expense. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments also are reflected in current earnings unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions.
The Company did not recognize any material net gains or losses related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges during 2009, 2008 and 2007. 
 
The Company had an unrealized net loss on net investment hedges of $2 million and $1 million, net of taxes, included in the cumulative translation adjustment account of accumulated other comprehensive
income (AOCI) as of September 26, 2009 and September 27, 2008, respectively. The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness test of net investment hedges are recorded in current earnings in other income
and expense. 
 
The Company recognized in earnings a net gain of $133 million on foreign currency forward and option contracts
not designated as hedging instruments during the year ended September 26, 2009.

principal and credit risk amounts of the Companys derivative instruments outstanding as of September 26, 2009 and September 27, 2008 (in millions):

The notional principal amounts for derivative instruments provide one measure of the
transaction volume outstanding as of September 26, 2009, and do not represent the amount of the Companys exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts represent the Companys gross exposure to potential accounting loss
on these transactions if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency exchange rates at each respective date. The Companys gross exposure on these transactions may be further
mitigated by collateral received from certain counterparties. The Companys exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a function of currency exchange rates. Although the table above reflects the notional principal and
credit risk amounts of the Companys foreign exchange instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the foreign exchange instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately
realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. 
 
The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with
the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received when the net fair value of certain financial instruments exceeds contractually
established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values. The Company did not record a material amount of cash collateral related to the derivative instruments under its master
netting arrangements as of September 26, 2009. The Company did not have any derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features that would require it to post additional collateral as of September 26, 2009. 
 
The estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models and prevailing financial market information as of
September 26, 2009. Refer to Note 3, Fair Value Measurements of this Form 10-K,

Accounts Receivable 
 
Trade Receivables 
 
The Company distributes its products through third-party
distributors, cellular network carriers, and resellers and directly to certain education, consumer and enterprise customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral in
certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Australia, or by requiring third-party
financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk
sharing related to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables not covered by collateral, third-party financing arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Companys distribution and retail channel
partners. Trade receivables from one of the Companys customers accounted for 16% of trade receivables as of September 26, 2009 and two of the Companys customers accounted for 15% and 10%, respectively, of trade receivables as of
September 27, 2008.

Vendor Non-Trade Receivables 
 
The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture
sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these raw material components directly from suppliers. These non-trade receivables, which are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in other current assets,
totaled $1.7 billion and $2.3 billion as of September 26, 2009 and September 27, 2008, respectively. Vendor non-trade receivables from two of the Companys vendors accounted for 40% and 36%, respectively, of non-trade receivables as
of September 26, 2009 and two of the Companys vendors accounted for 47% and 38%, respectively, of non-trade receivables as of September 27, 2008. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in net sales and does not
recognize any profits on these sales until the related products are sold by the Company, at which time any profit is recognized as a reduction of cost of sales. 
 
Note 3  Fair Value Measurements 
 
The Company defines fair value as
the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are
required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset
or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and credit risk. 
 
 


71 






Table of Contents


The Company applies the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to
measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement: 
 
Level 1
  Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
 
Level 2 
 Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets,
or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 
 
Level 3 
 Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect managements estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

 
The Companys valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity
securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of all other financial instruments, all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings,
were valued based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.

The foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pretax earnings of $4.4
billion, $3.5 billion and $2.2 billion in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. As of September 26, 2009 and September 27, 2008, $17.4 billion and $11.3 billion, respectively, of the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. The Companys consolidated
financial statements provide for any related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated, aside from undistributed earnings of certain of the Companys foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations
outside the U.S. U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $5.1 billion of such earnings. It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that might be incurred if these earnings were to be distributed.

Table of Contents


Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits, and the
future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income
in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. 
 
As of September 26, 2009 and

The Companys income taxes payable have been reduced by the tax benefits from
employee stock plan awards. For stock options, the Company receives an income tax benefit calculated as the difference between the fair market value of the stock issued at the time of the exercise and the option price, tax effected. The Company
had net tax benefits from employee stock plan awards of $246 million, $770 million and $398 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, which were reflected as increases to common stock. 
 
On October 3, 2008, the Tax Extenders and Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008 was signed into law. This bill, among other things, retroactively extended the expired
research and development tax credit. As a result, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $42 million in the first quarter of 2009 to account for the retroactive effects of the research credit extension. 
 
Uncertain Tax Positions 
 
As discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies the Company adopted new accounting principles on accounting for uncertain tax positions in 2008. Under these new principles, tax positions are evaluated in a
two-step process. The Company first determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax

 
 


76 






Table of Contents



position will be sustained upon examination. If a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold it is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the
financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Upon adoption of these new principles, the Companys cumulative effect of a
change in accounting principle resulted in an increase to retained earnings of $11 million. The Company had historically classified interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits as current liabilities. Beginning with the adoption of these new
principles, the Company classifies gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The total
amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of the date of adoption was $475 million, of which $209 million, if recognized, would affect the Companys effective tax rate. 
 
The Companys total gross unrecognized tax benefits are classified as non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 26, 2009, the total amount
of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $971 million, of which $307 million, if recognized, would affect the Companys effective tax rate. As of September 27, 2008, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $506 million, of
which $253 million, if recognized, would affect the Companys effective tax rate. 
 
On May 27, 2009, the United
States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued its ruling in the case of 
Xilinx, Inc. v. Commissioner
, holding that stock-based compensation is required to be included in certain transfer pricing arrangements between a U.S. company
and its offshore subsidiary. As a result of the ruling in this case, the Company increased its liability for unrecognized tax benefits by approximately $86 million and decreased shareholders equity by approximately $78 million in the year
ended September 26, 2009. 
 
The aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes
interest and penalties, for the two years ended September 26, 2009, is as follows (in millions):

The Companys policy to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized
tax benefits within the provision for income taxes did not change as a result of adopting the new accounting principles on accounting for uncertain tax positions in 2008. As of the date of adoption, the Company had accrued $203 million for the gross
interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits. As of September 26, 2009 and September 27, 2008, the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $291 million and $219 million, respectively, which is classified as
non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In 2009 and 2008, the Company recognized interest expense in connection with tax matters of $64 million and $16 million, respectively. 
 
The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign
jurisdictions. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, all years prior to 2002 are closed. The years 2002-2003 have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) and disputed issues have been taken

 
 


77 






Table of Contents



to administrative appeals. The IRS is currently examining the 2004-2006 years. In addition, the Company is also subject to audits by state, local and foreign tax authorities. In major states
and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 1988 and 2000, respectively, generally remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities. 
 
Management believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues
addressed in the Companys tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs. Although timing of the
resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce its unrecognized tax benefits by between $105 million and $145 million in the next 12 months.

 
Note 7  Shareholders Equity and Stock-Based Compensation 
 
Preferred Stock 
 
The Company has five million shares of authorized
preferred stock, none of which is issued or outstanding. Under the terms of the Companys Restated Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors is authorized to determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the
Companys authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock. 
 
Comprehensive Income 
 
Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue,
expenses, gains and losses that under GAAP are recorded as an element of shareholders equity but are excluded from net income. The Companys other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those
subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash
flow hedges. 
 
The following table summarizes the components of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of taxes, as of the
three years ended September 26, 2009 (in millions):

Employee Benefit Plans 
 
2003 Employee Stock Plan 
 
The 2003 Employee Stock Plan (the 2003 Plan) is a shareholder
approved plan that provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers. The 2003 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, stock purchase rights
and performance-based awards. Based on the terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 2003 Plan generally expire seven to ten years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based on
continued employment, with either annual, semi-annual or quarterly vesting. In general, RSUs granted under the 2003 Plan vest over two to four years, are subject to the employees continued employment and do not have an expiration date. As of
September 26, 2009, approximately 37 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2003 Plan. 
 
1997 Employee
Stock Option Plan 
 
In August 1997, the Companys Board of Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Option
Plan (the 1997 Plan), a non-shareholder approved plan for grants of stock options to employees who are not officers of the Company. Based on the terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 1997 Plan generally expire
seven to ten years after the grant date. All stock options granted under the 1997 Plan are fully vested. In October 2003, the Company terminated the 1997 Plan, and no new options can be granted from this plan. 
 
1997 Director Stock Option Plan 
 
In August 1997, the Companys Board of Directors adopted a Director Stock Option Plan (the Director Plan) for non-employee directors of the Company, which was approved by
shareholders in 1998. Pursuant to the Director Plan, the Companys non-employee directors are granted an option to acquire 30,000 shares of common stock upon their initial election to the Board (Initial Options). The Initial Options
vest and become exercisable in three equal annual installments on each of the first through third anniversaries of the grant date. On the fourth anniversary of a non-employee directors initial election to the Board and on each subsequent
anniversary thereafter, the director will be entitled to receive an option to acquire 10,000 shares of common stock (Annual Options). Annual Options are fully vested and immediately exercisable on their date of grant. Options granted
under the Director Plan expire ten years after the grant date. As of September 26, 2009, approximately 240,000 shares were reserved for future issuance under the Director Plan. 
 
Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans 
 
As of October 16, 2009, executive
officers Timothy D. Cook, Ronald B. Johnson, Peter Oppenheimer, Philip W. Schiller and Bertrand Serlet have entered into trading plans pursuant to Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). A
trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Companys stock including the exercise and sale of employee
stock options and shares acquired pursuant to the Companys employee stock purchase plan and upon vesting of RSUs. 
 
Employee Stock
Purchase Plan 
 
The Company has a shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan (the Purchase Plan),
under which substantially all employees may purchase common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values as of the beginning and end of six-month offering periods. Stock purchases

under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of an employees compensation, up to a maximum of $25,000 in any calendar year. The number of shares authorized to be purchased in any calendar
year is limited to a total of 3 million shares. As of September 26, 2009, approximately 4.7 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan. 
 
Employee Savings Plan 
 
The Company has an employee savings plan (the
Savings Plan) qualifying as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the Savings Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the IRS annual
contribution limit ($16,500 for calendar year 2009). The Company matches 50% to 100% of each employees contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employees eligible earnings. The Companys matching
contributions to the Savings Plan were $59 million, $50 million and $39 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 
 
Restricted Stock
Units 
 
Historically, the Company used equity awards in the form of stock options as one of the means for recruiting and
retaining highly skilled talent. In conjunction with the Companys 2009 equity compensation program changes, it began issuing primarily RSUs rather than stock options for eligible employees as the primary type of long-term equity-based award. A
summary of the Companys RSU activity and related information for the three years ended September 26, 2009, is as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):

The fair value as of the vesting date of RSUs that vested was $221 million, $320
million and $6 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Upon vesting, the RSUs are generally net share-settled to cover the required withholding tax and the remaining amount is converted into an equivalent number of shares of common stock. The
majority of RSUs vested in 2009, 2008 and 2007, were net-share settled such that the Company withheld shares with value equivalent to the employees minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted
the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 707,000, 857,000 and 20,000 for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their vesting date as determined by the
Companys closing stock price. Total payments for the employees tax obligations to the taxing authorities were $82 million, $124 million and $3 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within
the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These net-share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the Company as they reduced and retired the number of shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting and did
not represent an expense to the Company.

Aggregate intrinsic value represents the value of the Companys closing stock
price on the last trading day of the fiscal period in excess of the weighted-average exercise price multiplied by the number of options outstanding or exercisable. The aggregate intrinsic value excludes the effect of stock options that have a zero
or negative intrinsic value. Total intrinsic value of options at time of exercise was $827 million, $2.0 billion and $1.3 billion for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 
 
RSUs granted are deducted from the shares available for grant under the Companys stock option plans utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. Similarly, RSUs cancelled are added
back to the shares available for grant under the Companys stock option plans utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs cancelled. Outstanding RSU balances are not included in the outstanding options balances in the stock option
activity table. 
 
Stock-Based Compensation 
 
Stock-based compensation cost for RSUs is measured based on the closing fair market value of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation cost for stock options is
estimated at the grant

Table of Contents



date based on each options fair-value as calculated by the BSM option-pricing model. The BSM option-pricing model incorporates various assumptions including expected volatility, expected
life and interest rates. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Companys common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Companys stock options and other
relevant factors including implied volatility in market traded options on the Companys common stock. The Company bases its expected life assumption on its historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards it grants to
employees. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation cost as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. 
 
The weighted-average assumptions used for the three years ended September 26, 2009, and the resulting estimates of weighted-average fair value per share of options granted and of employee stock
purchase plan rights (stock purchase rights) during those periods are as follows:

(a)


 
In conjunction with the Companys 2009 equity compensation program changes, it began issuing primarily RSUs rather than stock options to
employees, although the Company continues to grant stock options to non-employee directors. Accordingly the weighted average expected life of stock options was influenced by non-employee director stock option grants, which had a ten-year expected
life. The weighted average expected life of stock options also affects the resulting interest rate and expected volatility assumptions.

compensation cost related to stock options and RSUs expected to vest was $1.4 billion as of September 26, 2009, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.53 years. 
 
Note 8  Commitments and Contingencies 
 
Lease Commitments 
 
The Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under
noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any other off-balance sheet financing arrangements. The

Table of Contents



major facility leases are generally for terms of one to 20 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of one to five additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms of five to
20 years, the majority of which are for ten years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of September 26, 2009, the Companys total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $1.9 billion, of which
$1.5 billion related to leases for retail space. 
 
Rent expense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and
noncancelable leases, was $231 million, $207 million and $151 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of one year as of September 26,

Accrued Warranty and Indemnifications 
 
The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period for hardware products is typically one year from the date of purchase
by the end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the Companys hardware products. The Company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product
warranties at the time related revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical and projected
warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Companys typical experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting warranty liabilities and
adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates. For products accounted for under subscription accounting, the Company recognizes warranty expense as incurred. 
 
The Company periodically provides updates to its applications and system software to maintain the softwares compliance with published
specifications. The estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for as warranty costs that are recognized at the time related software revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates
include the number of units delivered, the number of updates expected to occur, and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates. 
 
The following table reconciles changes in the Companys accrued warranties and related costs for the three years ended September 26, 2009 (in millions):

The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and
application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to
costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party.

 
 


83 






Table of Contents



However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of
management, does not have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results. Therefore, the Company did not record a
liability for infringement costs as of either September 26, 2009 or September 27, 2008. 
 
The Company has entered
into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status
as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these
agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. However, the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such
obligations, and payments made under these agreements historically have not materially adversely affected the Companys financial condition or operating results. 
 
Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product 
 
Although most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components including but not limited to microprocessors, enclosures, certain liquid crystal displays
(LCDs), certain optical drives and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources, which subjects the Company to significant supply and pricing risks.
Many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources including but not limited to NAND flash memory, dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and certain LCDs, are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and
significant commodity pricing fluctuations. In addition, the Company has entered into certain agreements for the supply of key components including but not limited to microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs at favorable pricing, but there
is no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar favorable terms, or at all, upon expiration or otherwise obtain favorable pricing in the future. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks
of supply shortages and/or price increases that can materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. 
 
The Company and other participants in the personal computer, mobile communication and consumer electronics industries also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. In
addition, the Company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer, mobile communication and consumer electronics industries, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components
available from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the
suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the Companys supply of a key single-sourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, if such components were available only at
significantly higher prices, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Companys business
and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of
these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements. 
 
Significant portions of the Companys Mac computers, iPhones, iPods, logic boards and other assembled products are now manufactured by
outsourcing partners, primarily in various parts of Asia. A significant concentration of this outsourced manufacturing is currently performed by only a few of the Companys outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these
outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced supplier of components and manufacturing outsourcing for many of the Companys key products including but not limited to final assembly of substantially all of the Companys portable Mac computers,
iPhones, iPods and most of the Companys desktop products. Although

 
 


84 






Table of Contents



the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Companys operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to
meet their production commitments. The Companys purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. 
 
Long-Term Supply Agreements 
 
The Company has entered into prepaid long-term supply agreements to secure the
supply of certain inventory components. During the first quarter of 2009, a long-term supply agreement with Intel Corporation was terminated and the remaining prepaid balance of $167 million was repaid to the Company. During the second and fourth
quarters of 2009, the Company made a prepayment of $500 million to LG Display for the purchase of LCD panels and a prepayment of $500 million to Toshiba to purchase NAND flash memory, respectively. As of September 26, 2009, the Company had
a total of $1.2 billion of inventory component prepayments outstanding. 
 
Contingencies 
 
The Company is subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been
fully adjudicated, which are discussed in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading Legal Proceedings. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings
and claims that would individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results. However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. If the Company failed to prevail in any of
these legal matters or if several of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. 
 
Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental, product safety and other
regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and
regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including various countries within Europe and Asia and certain states and provinces within North America. Although the Company does not anticipate any material
adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not materially adversely affect the Companys financial condition or operating
results. 
 
Note 9
  
Segment Information and Geographic Data 
 
The Company reports segment information based on the management approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making
decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Companys reportable segments. 
 
The Company manages its business
primarily on a geographic basis. Accordingly, the Company determined its operating segments, which are generally based on the nature and location of its customers, to be the Americas, Europe, Japan, Asia-Pacific, Retail and FileMaker operations. The
Companys reportable operating segments consist of Americas, Europe, Japan and Retail operations. Other operating segments include Asia Pacific, which encompasses Australia and Asia except for Japan and the Companys FileMaker, Inc.
subsidiary. The Americas, Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific segments exclude activities related to the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries, as well as the Middle
East and Africa. The Retail segment operates Apple-owned retail stores in the U.S. and in international markets. Each reportable operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services to the same types of customers.
The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. 
 
The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers, while Retail
segment net sales are based on sales from the Companys retail stores. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to

 
 


85 






Table of Contents



third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures
are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses, such as manufacturing
costs and variances not included in standard costs, research and development, corporate marketing expenses, stock-based compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges, and other separately managed general and administrative costs.
The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. Segment assets exclude corporate assets, such as cash, short-term and long-term investments, manufacturing and corporate facilities,
miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets. Except for the Retail segment, capital asset purchases for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment. Cash payments for capital asset purchases
by the Retail segment were $369 million, $389 million and $294 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 
 
The Company has
certain retail stores that have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these
stores require substantially more investment than the Companys more typical retail stores. The Company allocates certain operating expenses associated with its high-profile stores to corporate marketing expense to reflect the estimated
Company-wide benefit. The allocation of these operating costs to corporate expense is based on the amount incurred for a high-profile store in excess of that incurred by a more typical Company retail location. The Company had opened a total of 11
high-profile stores as of September 26, 2009. Expenses allocated to corporate marketing resulting from the operations of high-profile stores were $65 million, $53 million and $39 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Report of Ernst & Young LLP, Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm 
 
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Apple Inc. 
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Apple Inc. as of September 26, 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders
equity, and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. 
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion. 
 
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the consolidated financial position of Apple Inc. at September 26, 2009, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
Apple Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of September 26, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
and our report dated October 27, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Ernst & Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 


 
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Apple Inc. 
 
We have audited Apple Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of September 26, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Apple Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit. 
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
In our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 26, 2009, based on the COSO criteria.

 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated financial statements of Apple Inc. as of and for the year ended September 26, 2009 and our report dated October 27, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
 


Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  


Apple Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively "Apple" or the "Company") design, manufacture, and market personal computers, portable digital music players,
and mobile communication devices and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, and networking solutions. The Company sells its products worldwide through its online stores, its
retail stores, its direct sales force, and third-party wholesalers, resellers, and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Mac, iPod and iPhone compatible
products including application software, printers, storage devices, speakers, headphones, and various other accessories and supplies through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to
education, consumer, creative professional, business, and government customers. 


Basis of Presentation and Preparation  


The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these
consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior year amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 


The
Company's fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Company's first quarter of fiscal year 2007 contained 13 weeks and the first quarter
of fiscal year 2006 contained 14 weeks. The Company's fiscal year 2007 ended on September 29, 2007 and included 52 weeks, while fiscal year 2006 included 53 weeks and fiscal year 2005 included
52 weeks. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years or quarters refer to the Company's fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters of those fiscal years. 


Financial Instruments  


Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments  


All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. Highly liquid investments with maturities
greater than three months at the date of purchase are classified as short-term investments. The Company's debt and marketable equity securities have been classified and accounted for as
available-for-sale. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments in debt and marketable equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates the
available-for-sale designations as of each balance sheet date. These securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a
component of shareholders' equity. The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method. 


Derivative Financial Instruments  


The Company accounts for its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value. Derivatives that are not defined as hedges in Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, 
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,
 as amended, must be adjusted to
fair value through earnings. 


For
derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative
instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction
affects 


59








 




earnings.
The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in current earnings. To receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective
in offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that are
designated as fair value hedges, the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings
in the current period. The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure of the net
investment in a foreign operation is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For forward contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes
in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this component are recognized in current earnings. 


Inventories  


Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out method, or market. If the cost of the inventories exceeds their
market value, provisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. The Company's inventories consist primarily of finished goods for all periods presented. 


Property, Plant, and Equipment  


Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which
for buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, up to 5 years for equipment, and the shorter of lease terms or 10 years for leasehold
improvements. The Company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related to
internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 5 years. Depreciation and
amortization expense on property and equipment was $249 million, $180 million, and $141 million during 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. 


Asset Retirement Obligations  


The Company records obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs in accordance with SFAS
No. 143, 
Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations
. The Company reviews legal obligations associated with the retirement of
long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. If it is determined that a legal obligation exists, the fair value of the
liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of the liability is added to the
carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. The difference between the gross expected future cash flow and its present value
is accreted over the life of the related lease as an operating expense. All of the Company's existing asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to
operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. The Company's asset retirement liability was $18 million and $15 million as of September 29, 2007 and
September 30, 2006, respectively. 


Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets  


The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, 
 
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived



60








 


 Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of.
 Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to
generate. If property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the
assets exceeds its fair market value. The Company did not record any material impairments during 2007, 2006, and 2005. 


SFAS
No. 142, 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be
amortized but rather be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. The Company performs its goodwill impairment
tests on or about August 31 of each year. The Company did not recognize any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in 2007, 2006, or 2005. The Company established reporting units based
on its current reporting structure. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit. 


SFAS
No. 142 also requires that intangible assets with definite lives be amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144. The
Company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods ranging from 2 to 10 years. 


Foreign Currency Translation  


The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its international non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in
effect at the end of each period. Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations
are credited or charged to foreign currency translation included in "accumulated other comprehensive income" in shareholders' equity. The Company's foreign manufacturing subsidiaries and certain other
international subsidiaries that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and inventories,
property, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. Gains and losses from these translations were insignificant and have been included in the Company's results of operations. 


Revenue Recognition  


Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, music products, digital content, peripherals, and service and support contracts. For any product
within these groups that either is software, or is considered software-related in accordance with the guidance in Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") No. 03-5, 
 
Applicability of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2 to
Non-Software Deliverables in an Arrangement Containing More-Than-Incidental
Software
 (e.g., Macintosh computers and iPod portable digital music players), the Company accounts for such products in accordance with the revenue recognition provisions of
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA") Statement of Position ("SOP") No. 97-2, 
Software Revenue Recognition
.
The Company applies Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 104, 
Revenue Recognition,
 for products that are not software or software-related, such
as digital content sold on the iTunes Store and certain Mac, iPod and iPhone supplies and accessories. 


The
Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered
delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For 


61








 




most
of the Company's product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain
other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If at the outset of an
arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed not to be, fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable. 


Revenue
from service and support contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the service coverage periods. These contracts typically include extended phone support, repair services,
web-based support resources, diagnostic tools, and extend the service coverage offered under the Company's one-year limited warranty. 


The
Company sells software and peripheral products obtained from other companies. The Company establishes its own pricing and retains related inventory risk, is the primary obligor in sales
transactions with its customers, and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue for the sale of products obtained from other companies
based on the gross amount billed. 


The
Company accounts for multiple element arrangements that consist only of software or software-related products in accordance with SOP No. 97-2. If a multiple-element arrangement
includes deliverables that are neither software nor software-related, the Company applies EITF No. 00-21, 
Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables,
 to determine if those deliverables constitute separate units of accounting from the SOP No. 97-2 deliverables. If the Company can separate the
deliverables, the Company applies SOP No. 97-2 to the software and software-related deliverables and applies other appropriate guidance (e.g., SAB No. 104) to the
deliverables outside the scope of SOP No. 97-2. Revenue on arrangements that include multiple elements such as hardware, software, and services is allocated to each element based on
the relative fair value of each element. Each element's allocated revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met. Fair value is generally determined by
vendor specific objective evidence ("VSOE"), which is based on the price charged when each element is sold separately. If the Company cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered
element included in a multiple-element arrangement, the Company defers revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been performed, or until fair value can objectively be determined for
any remaining undelivered elements. When the fair value of a delivered element has not been established, the Company uses the residual method to recognize revenue if the fair value of all undelivered
elements is determinable. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and
is recognized as revenue. 


The
Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other
sales programs and volume-based incentives. The estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue in the period the Company has sold the product and committed to a plan. The
Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company's historical experience. Revenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted
to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority. 


Generally,
the Company does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales or the sale of extended warranty and support contracts. When the
Company does offer specified upgrade rights, the Company defers revenue for the fair value of the specified upgrade 


62








 




right
until the future obligation is fulfilled or when the right to the specified upgrade expires. Additionally, a limited number of the Company's software products are available with maintenance
agreements that grant customers rights to unspecified future upgrades over the maintenance term on a when and if available basis. Revenue associated with such maintenance is recognized ratably over

In
March 2007, the Company began shipping Apple TV and in June 2007 began shipping iPhone. For Apple TV and iPhone, the Company indicated it may provide future unspecified features and
additional software products free of charge to customers. Accordingly, Apple TV and iPhone handsets sales are accounted for under subscription accounting in accordance with SOP
No. 97-2. As such, the Company's policy is to defer the associated revenue and cost of goods sold at the time of sale, and recognize both on a straight-line basis over
the currently estimated 24-month economic life of these products, with any loss recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred by the Company for engineering, sales, marketing and warranty
are expensed as incurred. 


Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  


The Company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. The Company considers historical experience, the age of the accounts
receivable balances, credit quality of the Company's customers, current economic conditions, and other factors that may affect customers' ability to pay. 


Shipping Costs  


For all periods presented, amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue, and the Company's shipping and handling costs are included in
cost of sales. 


Warranty Expense  


The Company generally provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. The Company assesses the adequacy of
its preexisting warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates. For products accounted for under subscription accounting pursuant
to SOP No. 97-2, the Company recognizes warranty expense as incurred. 


Software Development Costs  


Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization
beginning when a product's technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers pursuant to SFAS No. 86, 
 
Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise
Marketed
. In most instances, the Company's products are released soon after technological feasibility
has been established. Therefore, costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally most software development costs have been expensed. 


In
2007, the Company determined that both Mac OS X Version 10.5 Leopard ("Mac OS X Leopard") and iPhone achieved technological feasibility. During 2007, the Company capitalized $75 million of
costs associated with the development of Leopard and iPhone. In accordance with SFAS No. 86, the capitalized costs related to Mac OS X Leopard and iPhone are amortized to cost of
sales commencing when each respective product begins shipping and are recognized on a straight-line basis over a 3 year estimated useful life of the underlying technology. 


63








 




Total
amortization related to capitalized software development costs was $13 million, $18 million, and $16 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. 


Advertising Costs  


Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $467 million, $338 million, and $287 million for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. 


Stock-Based Compensation  


On September 25, 2005, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) ("SFAS No. 123R"), 
Share-Based
Payment
, which addresses the accounting for stock-based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of
the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise's equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. In
January 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued SAB No. 107, which provides supplemental implementation guidance for SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R
eliminates the ability to account for stock-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method under Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, 
 
Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees
, and instead generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based
method. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton ("BSM") option-pricing model to determine the fair-value of stock-based awards under SFAS No. 123R, consistent with that used for
pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123, 
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
. 


SFAS
No. 123R prohibits recognition of a deferred tax asset for an excess tax benefit that has not been realized. The Company will recognize a benefit from stock-based compensation in equity if
an incremental tax benefit is realized by following the ordering provisions of the tax law. In addition, the Company accounts for the indirect effects of stock-based compensation on the research tax
credit, the foreign tax credit, and the domestic manufacturing deduction through the income statement. 


Prior
to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company measured compensation expense for its employee stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB Opinion
No. 25. The Company applied the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123 as amended by SFAS No. 148, 
Accounting for Stock-Based
CompensationTransition and Disclosure,
 as if the fair-value-based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense. Under APB Opinion
No. 25, when the exercise price of the Company's employee stock options was equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant, no compensation expense was recognized. 


64








 




The
following table illustrates the effect on net income after taxes and net income per common share as if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to

Earnings Per Common Share  


Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period
increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of common stock had been issued. The dilutive effect of
outstanding options, shares to be purchased under the employee stock purchase plan, unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units ("RSUs") is reflected in diluted earnings per share by
application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the Company's common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from outstanding
options, restricted stock, and RSUs. Additionally, the exercise of employee stock options and the vesting of restricted stock and RSUs can result in a greater dilutive effect on earnings per share.

potentially dilutive securities include stock options, unvested restricted stock, and RSUs. 


Comprehensive Income  


Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains, and losses that under
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders' equity but are excluded from net income. The Company's other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency
translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as
available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges. 


Segment Information  


The Company reports segment information based on the "management" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions
and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments. Information about the Company's products, major customers, and geographic areas on a company-wide basis is
also disclosed.

The
Company's U.S. Corporate securities consist primarily of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, time deposits, and corporate debt securities. Foreign securities consist primarily of foreign
commercial paper issued by foreign companies, and certificates of deposit and time deposits with foreign institutions, most of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company had $11 million
in net unrealized losses on its investment portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years, as of September 29, 2007, and net unrealized
losses of approximately $687,000 on its investment portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities less than 1 year, as of September 30, 2006. The Company may sell its
investments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. The Company recognized net gains before taxes of approximately
$474,000 in 2007 and net losses before taxes of approximately $434,000 and $137,000 in 2006 and 2005, respectively. 


As
of September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006, $1.9 billion and $921 million, respectively, of the Company's short-term investments had underlying maturities
ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remaining short-term investments as of September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006 had maturities less than 12 months.

The
unrealized losses on the Company's investments during 2007 in U.S. Corporate securities and foreign securities and during 2006 in U.S. Corporate securities were caused primarily by changes in
interest rates. The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities with strong liquidity and with low probabilities of default. The Company's investment policy requires investments to be rated
single-A or better. Therefore, the Company considers the declines to be temporary in nature. During 2007, the Company did not record any material impairment on outstanding securities. As
of September 29, 2007, the Company does not consider the investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired. 


Market
values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating the investments for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews
factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, and the Company's ability and intent to hold the investment for a
period of time, which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value. 


Accounts Receivable  


Trade Receivables  


The Company distributes its products through third-party distributors and resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and commercial customers. The Company generally
does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company requires collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit
risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Australia by arranging with third-party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements
and other loan and lease programs to the Company's direct customers. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the
Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables not 


68








 


covered
by collateral, third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Company's distribution and retail channel partners. One customer accounted for approximately 11%
of trade receivables as of September 29, 2007, while no customers accounted for more than 10% of trade receivables as of September 30, 2006.

Vendor Non-Trade Receivables  


The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors
who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these raw material components directly from suppliers. These non-trade
receivables, which are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in other current assets, totaled $2.4 billion and $1.6 billion as of September 29, 2007 and September 30,
2006, respectively. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in net sales and does not recognize any profits on these sales until the products are sold through to the end customer at
which time the profit is recognized as a reduction of cost of sales. 


Derivative Financial Instruments  


The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange risk. Foreign currency forward and option contracts are used to offset the foreign
exchange risk on certain existing assets and liabilities and to hedge the foreign exchange risk on expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales. The Company's accounting
policies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair
value.

The
notional principal amounts for derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of year-end, and do not represent the amount of the Company's
exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts shown in the table above represents the Company's gross exposure to potential accounting loss on these transactions if all counterparties
failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency exchange rates at each respective date. The Company's exposure to credit loss and market risk will
vary over time as a function of currency exchange rates. 


The
estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models and prevailing financial market information as of September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006. Although
the table above reflects the notional principal, fair value, and credit risk amounts of the Company's foreign exchange instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the
exposures and transactions that the foreign exchange instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and
losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. 


Foreign Exchange Risk Management  


The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risk associated with existing assets
and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Generally, the Company's practice is to hedge a majority of its
material foreign exchange exposures. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, or
limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments. 


To
help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company's U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and the
Company's non-U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries selling in local currencies hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries' functional currency.
Other comprehensive income associated with hedges of foreign currency revenue is recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related sales are recognized, and other comprehensive
income related to inventory purchases is recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. 


70








 




Typically,
the Company hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases over a time horizon of up to 6 months. 


Derivative
instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time
period or within a subsequent 2 month time period. Deferred gains and losses in other comprehensive income associated with such derivative instruments are immediately reclassified into earnings
in other income and expense. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are also reflected in current earnings unless they are re-designated as hedges of other
transactions. The Company recognized net gains of approximately $672,000 and $421,000 in 2007 and 2006, respectively, and a net loss of $1.6 million in 2005 in other income and expense related
to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges due to changes in the Company's forecast of future net sales and cost of sales and due to prevailing market conditions. As of
September 29, 2007, the Company had a net deferred gain associated with cash flow hedges of approximately $468,000, net of taxes, substantially all of which is expected to be reclassified to
earnings by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2008. 


The
net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument designated as a net investment hedge is included in the cumulative translation adjustment account of accumulated other
comprehensive income within shareholders' equity. For the years ended September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006, the Company had a net loss of $2.6 million and a net gain of
$7.4 million, respectively, included in the cumulative translation adjustment. 


The
Company may also enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and
liabilities recorded in non-functional currencies. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in current earnings in other income and expense as offsets to the changes
in the fair value of the related assets or liabilities. Due to currency market movements, changes in option time value can lead to increased volatility in other income and expense.

As
of September 29, 2007, and September 30, 2006, the weighted-average amortization period for acquired technology was 7.1 years and 8.5 years, respectively. 


During
2006, the Company sold certain assets related to its PowerSchool web-based student information system operations. In connection with this sale, the Company reduced goodwill by
$31 million for the outstanding balance from the acquisition of PowerSchool, Inc. in 2001 and recognized a $4 million pre-tax gain, which is reflected in other income
and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 


Expected
annual amortization expense related to acquired technology is as follows (in millions):

The
foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pretax earnings of $2.2 billion, $1.5 billion, and $922 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. As of
September 29, 2007, $6.5 billion of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S.
dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. The Company's consolidated financial statements provide for
any related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated, aside from undistributed earnings of certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in
operations outside the U.S. U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $2.4 billion of such earnings. It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that
might be incurred if these earnings were to be distributed. 


Deferred
tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits, and the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts
of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected
to be recovered or settled.

As
of September 29, 2007, the Company has tax loss and credit carryforwards in the tax effected amount of $8 million. As of September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006, a
valuation allowance of $5 million was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of state operating losses that may not be realized. Management believes it is more likely than not
that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to
fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. 


A
reconciliation of the provision for income taxes, with the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate (35% in 2007, 2006, and 2005) to income before provision for income

The
Company's income taxes payable have been reduced by the tax benefits from employee stock options. The Company receives an income tax benefit calculated as the difference between the fair market
value of the stock issued at the time of the exercise and the option price, tax effected. The net tax benefits from employee stock option transactions were $398 million, $419 million,
and $428 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, and were reflected as an increase to common stock in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity. 


75








 




The
Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has completed its field audit of the Company's federal income tax returns for the years 2002 through 2003 and proposed certain adjustments. The Company intends to
contest certain of these adjustments through the IRS Appeals Office. All IRS audit issues for years prior to 2002 have been resolved. In addition, the Company is also subject to audits by state,
local, and foreign tax authorities. Management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be
predicted with certainty. Should any issues addressed in the Company's tax audits be resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its
provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs. In 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded tax benefits of $63 million and $20 million, respectively, due to the settlement of
prior year tax audits in the U.S. 


Note 6Shareholders' Equity  


Preferred Stock  


The Company has five million shares of authorized preferred stock, none of which is issued or outstanding. Under the terms of the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation,
the Board of Directors is authorized to determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the Company's authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock. 


Restricted Stock Units  


The Company's Board of Directors has granted RSUs to members of the Company's management team, excluding its CEO. These RSUs generally vest over four years either at the end of
the four-year service period, in two equal installments on the second and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant, or in equal installments on each of the first through fourth
anniversaries of the grant date. Upon vesting, the RSUs will convert into an equivalent number of shares of common stock. The compensation expense incurred by the Company for RSUs is based on the
closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant and is amortized ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The RSUs have been reflected in
the calculation of diluted earnings per share utilizing the treasury stock method. 


During
2007 and 2006, 45,000 and 2.47 million, respectively, previously granted RSUs vested. A majority of these vested RSUs were net-share settled such that the Company withheld
shares with value equivalent to the employees' minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total
shares withheld of approximately 20,000 and 990,000 for 2007 and 2006, respectively, was based on the value of the RSUs on their vesting date as determined by the Company's closing stock price. Total
payments for the employees' tax obligations to the taxing authorities were $3 million and $59 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within the
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These net-share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the Company as they reduced and retired the number of shares that would have
otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting and did not represent an expense to the Company. 


CEO Restricted Stock Award  


On March 19, 2003, the Company's Board of Directors granted 10 million shares of restricted stock to the Company's CEO that vested on March 19, 2006. The
amount of the restricted stock award expensed by the Company was based on the closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant and was amortized ratably on a
straight-line basis over the three-year requisite service period. Upon vesting during 2006, the 10 million shares of restricted stock had a fair value of
$646.6 million and had grant-date fair value of $7.48 per share. The restricted stock award was net-share settled such that the Company withheld shares with value
equivalent to the CEO's minimum statutory obligation for the applicable 


76








 


income
and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld of 4.6 million were based on the value of the restricted stock award on
the vesting date as determined by the Company's closing stock price of $64.66. The remaining shares net of those withheld were delivered to the Company's CEO. Total payments for the CEO's tax
obligations to the taxing authorities was $296 million in 2006 and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The net-share settlement
had the effect of share repurchases by the Company as it reduced and retired the number of shares outstanding and did not represent an expense to the Company. The Company's CEO has no remaining shares
of restricted stock. For the years ended September 30, 2006 and September 24, 2005, compensation expense related to restricted stock was $4.6 million and $24.9 million,
respectively. 


Stock Repurchase Plan  


In July 1999, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does
not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time. The Company has repurchased a total of 13.1 million shares at a cost of
$217 million under this plan and was authorized to repurchase up to an additional $283 million of its common stock as of September 29, 2007. 


Comprehensive Income  


Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains, and losses that under
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders' equity but are excluded from net income. The Company's other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency
translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as
available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges. 


The
following table summarizes the components of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of taxes (in millions):

Employee Benefit Plans  


2003 Employee Stock Plan  


The 2003 Employee Stock Plan (the "2003 Plan") is a shareholder approved plan that provides for broad-based grants to employees, including executive officers. Based on the
terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 2003 Plan generally expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based on
continued employment, with either annual or quarterly vesting. The 2003 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, stock
purchase rights and performance-based awards.
During 2007, the Company's shareholders approved an amendment to the 2003 Plan to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance by 28 million shares. 


1997 Employee Stock Option Plan  


In August 1997, the Company's Board of Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the "1997 Plan"), a non-shareholder approved plan for grants
of stock options to employees who are not officers of the Company. Based on the terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 1997 Plan generally expire 7 to 10 years after the
grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based on continued employment, with either annual or quarterly vesting. In October 2003, the Company terminated the 1997
Plan and no new options can be granted from this plan. 


1997 Director Stock Option Plan  


In August 1997, the Company's Board of Directors adopted a Director Stock Option Plan (the "Director Plan") for non-employee directors of the Company, which
was approved by shareholders in 1998. Pursuant to the Director Plan, the Company's non-employee directors are granted an option to acquire 30,000 shares of common stock upon their initial
election to the Board ("Initial Options
"
). The Initial Options vest and become exercisable in three equal annual installments on each of the first
through third anniversaries of the grant date. On the fourth anniversary of a non-employee director's initial election to the Board and on each subsequent anniversary thereafter, the
director will be entitled to receive an option to acquire 10,000 shares of common stock ("Annual Options"). Annual Options are fully vested and immediately exercisable on their date of grant. 


Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans  


Certain of the Company's executive officers, including Mr. Timothy D. Cook, Mr. Peter Oppenheimer, Mr. Philip W. Schiller, and Dr. Bertrand Serlet,
have entered into trading plans pursuant to 


78








 


Rule 10b5-1(c)(1)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. A trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula
for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company's stock including the exercise and sale of employee stock options and shares acquired pursuant to the
Company's employee stock purchase plan and upon vesting of RSUs. 


Employee Stock Purchase Plan  


The Company has a shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan (the "Purchase Plan"), under which substantially all employees may purchase common stock through payroll
deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values as of the beginning and end of six-month offering periods. Stock purchases under the Purchase Plan are limited to
10% of an employee's compensation, up to a maximum of $25,000 in any calendar year. During 2007, the Company's shareholders approved an amendment to the Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares
authorized for issuance by 6 million shares and limit the number of shares that may be purchased in any calendar year to 3 million shares. As of September 29, 2007, approximately
7 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan. 


Employee Savings Plan  


The Company has an employee savings plan (the "Savings Plan") qualifying as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the
Savings Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limit ($15,500 for calendar year 2007). The
Company matches 50% to 100% of each employee's contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employee's eligible earnings. The Company's matching contributions to the
Savings Plan were $39 million, $33 million, and $28 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

Aggregate intrinsic value represents the value of the Company's closing stock price on the last trading day of the fiscal period in excess of the exercise price
multiplied by the number of options outstanding or exercisable. Total intrinsic value of options at time of exercise was $1.3 billion, $1.2 billion, and $1.1 billion for 2007,
2006, and 2005, respectively. 


The
Company recognized $242 million, $163 million and $49 million of stock-based compensation expense in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Capitalized stock-based compensation
costs were $9 million as of September 29, 2007. There were no stock-based compensation costs capitalized as of September 30, 2006. The income tax benefit related to stock-based
compensation expense was $81 million and $39 million for the years ended September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006, respectively. The total unrecognized compensation cost
related to stock options and RSUs expected to vest was $631 million and $375 million as of September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006, respectively. The total unrecognized
compensation cost as of September 29, 2007, is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.92 years.

Note 6Shareholders' Equity (Continued)  


As of September 29, 2007, the Company had 4.7 million RSUs outstanding with a total grant-date fair value of $249 million that were excluded
from the options outstanding balances in the preceding table. The weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted during 2007, 2006, and 2005 was $88.51 per share, $70.92 per share, and $45.04
per share, respectively. Aggregate intrinsic value of RSUs was $701.3 million and $262.5 million at September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006, respectively. RSUs that
vested during 2007 and 2006 totaled 45,000 and 2.47 million, respectively, and had a fair value of $6.1 million and $148.5 million, respectively, as of the vesting date. Shares of
RSUs granted after April 2005 have been deducted from the shares available for grant under the Company's stock option plans utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. 


Note 7Stock-Based Compensation  


The Company has provided pro forma disclosures in Note 1 of the effect on net income and earnings per share for the year ended September 24, 2005 as if the fair
value method of accounting for stock-based compensation had been used for its employee stock option grants and employee stock purchase plan purchases. These pro forma effects have been estimated at
the date of grant and beginning of the period, respectively, using the BSM option-pricing model. 


The
Company uses the BSM option-pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock-based awards. The BSM option-pricing model incorporates various assumptions including expected volatility, expected
life, and interest rates. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company's common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the
Company's stock options and other relevant factors including implied volatility in market traded options on the Company's common stock. The Company bases its expected life assumption on its historical
experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards it grants to employees. Stock-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award's fair-value as
calculated by the BSM option-pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. 


The
weighted average assumptions used for 2007, 2006, and 2005 and the resulting estimates of weighted-average fair value per share of options granted and for stock purchases during those periods are

Note 8Commitments and Contingencies  


Lease Commitments  


The Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any other
off-balance sheet financing arrangements. The major facility leases are generally for terms of 3 to 15 years and generally 


81








 


provide
renewal options for terms of 3 to 7 additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms of 5 to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain
multi-year renewal options. As of September 29, 2007, the Company's total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $1.4 billion, of which
$1.1 billion related to leases for retail space. 


Rent
expense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $151 million, $138 million, and $140 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005,
respectively. Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of one year as of September 29, 2007, are as follows (in millions):

Accrued Warranty and Indemnifications  


The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period for hardware products is typically one year from the date of
purchase by the end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the Company's hardware products. The Company provides currently
for the estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product warranties at the time related revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals for product
warranty obligations include the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected
cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company's typical experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting warranty
liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates. For products accounted for under subscription accounting pursuant to SOP
No. 97-2, the Company recognizes warranty expense as incurred. 


The
Company periodically provides updates to its applications and system software to maintain the software's compliance with specifications. The estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for
as warranty costs that are recognized at the time related software revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units
delivered, the number of updates expected to occur, and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates.

The
Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property
rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim
against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against itself or an
indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a material adverse
effect on its financial condition or operating results. Therefore, the Company did not record a liability for infringement costs as of either September 29, 2007 or September 30, 2006. 


Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product  


Certain key components including, but not limited to, microprocessors, enclosures, certain LCDs, certain optical drives, and application-specific integrated circuits ("ASICs")
are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources which subjects the Company to supply and pricing risks. Many of these and other key components that are available from multiple
sources including, but not limited to, NAND flash memory, DRAM memory, and certain LCDs, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. In
addition, the Company has entered into certain agreements for the supply of critical components at favorable pricing, and there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these
agreements when they expire. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and/or price increases that can adversely affect gross margins and operating margins. In
addition, the Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the global personal computer, consumer electronics and mobile communication industries, and new products introduced by the
Company often utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers. If the supply of a
key single-sourced component to the Company were to be delayed or curtailed, or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company's ability to
ship related products in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely affected. The Company's business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time
required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components may be
affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements. Finally, significant portions of the
Company's CPUs, iPods, iPhones, logic boards, and other assembled products are now manufactured by outsourcing partners, primarily in various parts of Asia. A significant concentration of this
outsourced manufacturing is currently performed by only a few of the Company's outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced
supplier of components and manufacturing outsourcing for many of the Company's key products, including but not limited to, assembly 


83








 


of
most of the Company's portable Mac computers, iPods, and iPhones. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company's operating results could
be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. 


Long-Term Supply Agreements  


During the first quarter of 2006, the Company entered into long-term supply agreements with Hynix Semiconductor, Inc., Intel Corporation, Micron
Technology, Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and Toshiba Corporation to secure supply of NAND flash memory through calendar year 2010. As part of these agreements, the Company
prepaid $1.25 billion for flash memory components during 2006, which will be applied to certain inventory purchases made over the life of each respective agreement. The Company utilized
$208 million of the prepayment as of September 29, 2007. 


Contingencies  


The Company is subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully adjudicated. In the opinion of
management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its
financial condition or operating results. However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should
several of these legal matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. 


Production
and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers
the ability to return product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been
passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates including various countries within Europe and Asia, certain Canadian provinces and certain states within the U.S. Although the Company
does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not
have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or operating results. 


Note 9Segment Information and Geographic Data  


In accordance with SFAS No. 131, 
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information
, the Company reports
segment information based on the "management" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the
Company's reportable segments. 


The
Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. Accordingly, the Company determined its operating segments, which are generally based on the nature and location of its customers, to
be the Americas, Europe, Japan, Asia-Pacific, Retail, and FileMaker operations. The Company's four geographical segments, together with the Retail segment, all sell the same products to
the same types of customers. The Company's reportable operating segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail operations. The Americas, Europe, and Japan reportable segments
exclude activities related to the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The
Retail segment operates Apple-owned retail stores in the U.S., Canada, Japan, the U.K. and Italy. Other operating segments include 


84








 




Asia-Pacific,
which includes Australia and Asia except for Japan, and the Company's subsidiary, FileMaker, Inc. Each reportable geographic operating segment provides similar
hardware and software products, similar services and the accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1. 


The
Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of the customers, and net
sales for the Retail segment are based on sales from the Company's retail stores. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses
directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other
income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as manufacturing costs and
variances not included in standard costs, research and development, corporate marketing expenses, stock-based compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges, and other separately
managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. Segment assets exclude corporate assets such as cash,
short-term and long-term investments, manufacturing facilities, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets, and retail store
construction-in-progress not subject to depreciation. Except for the Retail segment, capital asset purchases for long-lived assets are not reported to management by
segment. Capital asset purchases by the Retail segment were $294 million, $200 million, and $132 million for 2007, 2006, and 2005 respectively. 


From
the establishment of the Retail segment in fiscal 2001 through the quarter ended March 31, 2007, Company management assessed the segment's operating performance differently from the
Company's other operating segments. Because the Company's Retail initiative was an unproven concept at inception, management chose to measure the Retail segment's performance in a manner that would
allow comparability to the Company's major channel partners operating retail stores in the U.S. There were three significant differences in the measurement of the Retail segment's results relative to
the Company's other operating segments. First, the Retail segment's operating income reflected cost of sales for Apple products at amounts normally charged to Apple's major U.S. channel partners for
the same products, less the cost of the Company's sales programs and other costs to support those partners. Second, the cost of sales of the Company's service and support contracts, including the
AppleCare Protection Plan ("APP") and .Mac, were reflected in the Retail segment's results at the costs charged to major channel partners for such contracts, and all associated revenue was reflected
in the Retail segment's results at the time of sale rather than being amortized over the lives of the respective agreements. Because the Company had not yet earned the revenue or incurred the cost
associated with the sale of such contracts, an offset to these amounts was recognized in other segments' net sales and cost of sales. Third, the Company allocated certain expenses related to the
operation of its high-profile stores to corporate marketing expense. 


Having
operated the Company's Retail stores successfully for more than six years, management believes its Retail initiative is a proven concept that will continue to be an integral element of the
Company's distribution and marketing strategies. Additionally, the Company expects sales of iPhone by the Company's geographic and Retail operating segments to generate significant levels of deferred
revenue and deferred cost of sales over time. In consideration of these factors, management has determined that beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2007, aligning measurements for the
performance of the Retail segment with those used for the Company's other operating segments provides the most meaningful information. Accordingly, management has begun to measure the Retail segment's
operating performance in a manner 


85








 




generally
consistent with the Company's other operating segments. The cost of sales of the Company's products sold through the Retail segment is now reflected at amounts similar to the cost of sales
of the same products reflected in the Company's other operating segments. Revenue from APP and .Mac contracts sold through the Retail segment is now being recognized over the lives of the respective
service agreements. Additionally, the Retail segment is applying the same subscription accounting to iPhone net sales and cost of sales that the Company's other operating segments apply. Management
believes aligning measurements for the performance of the Retail segment with those used for the Company's other operating segments will provide greater comparability with the rest of the Company's
segments and allow for more meaningful assessment of the Retail segment's operating results. The Company has reclassified prior period operating segment results to reflect these changes in the
measurement of the operating results for the Retail segment, along with the corresponding offsetting impact to the Company's other operating segments. 


The
Company will continue to allocate certain operating expenses associated with its high-profile stores to corporate marketing expense to reflect the estimated Company-wide
benefit. These high-profile stores are larger than the Company's typical retail stores and were designed to further promote brand awareness and provide a venue for certain corporate sales
and marketing activities, including corporate briefings. The allocation of these operating costs to corporate expense is based on the amount incurred for a high-profile store in excess of
that incurred by a more typical Company retail location. The Company had opened a total of eight high-profile stores as of September 29, 2007. Expenses allocated to corporate
marketing resulting from the operations of high-profile stores were $39 million, $33 million, and $31 million for the years ended September 29, 2007,
September 30, 2006, and September 24, 2005 respectively.

Note 10Related Party Transactions and Certain Other Transactions  


The Company entered into a Reimbursement Agreement with its CEO, Steve Jobs, for the reimbursement of expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs in the operation of his private plane
when used for Apple business. The Company recognized a total of approximately $776,000, $202,000, and $1,100,000 in expenses pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement during 2007, 2006, and 2005,
respectively. 


In
2006, the Company entered into an agreement with Pixar to sell certain of Pixar's short films on the iTunes Store. Mr. Jobs was the CEO, Chairman, and a large shareholder of Pixar. On
May 5, 2006, The Walt Disney Company ("Disney") acquired Pixar, which resulted in Pixar becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Disney. Upon Disney's acquisition of Pixar, Mr. Jobs' shares
of Pixar common stock were exchanged for Disney's common stock and he was elected to the Disney Board of Directors. Royalty expense recognized by the Company under the arrangement with Pixar from
September 25, 2005 through May 5, 2006 was less than $1 million.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  


The
Board of Directors and Shareholders

Apple Inc.: 


We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 29, 2007. These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. 


We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 


In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Apple Inc. and subsidiaries as of
September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 29,
2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 


As
discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, effective September 25, 2005, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123R, 
Share-Based Payment
. 


We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Apple Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of
September 29, 2007, based on criteria established in 
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated November 15, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial
reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  


The
Board of Directors and Shareholders

Apple Inc.: 


We
have audited Apple Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2007, based on criteria established in 
Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)
.

Apple's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included
in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit. 


We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit
also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 


A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 


Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 


In
our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2007, based on criteria established in 
 
Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework
 issued by COSO. 


We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September 29,
2007 and September 30, 2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
September 29, 2007, and our report dated November 15, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements
.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
 


Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  


Apple
Computer, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) designs, manufactures and markets personal computers and related software, peripherals and personal computing and communicating
solutions. The Company's products include the Macintosh line of desktop and notebook computers, the Mac OS X operating system, the iPod digital music player, and a portfolio of software products and
peripherals for education, creative, consumer and business customers. The Company sells its products through its online stores, direct sales force, third-party wholesalers and resellers, and its own
retail stores. 


Basis of Presentation and Preparation  


The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these
consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior year amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 


Typically,
the Company's fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of September. Fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001 were each 52-week years. However, approximately every six years, the Company
reports a 53-week fiscal year to align its fiscal quarters with calendar quarters by adding a week to its first fiscal quarter. All information presented herein is based on the Company's
fiscal calendar. 


Financial Instruments  


Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments  


The Company places its short-term investments in highly liquid securities issued by high credit quality issuers. All highly liquid investments with maturities of
three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents; highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as short-term
investments. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments in debt and marketable equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each
balance sheet date. The Company's debt and marketable equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. These securities are carried at fair
value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of shareholders' equity. The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method. 


Non-Current Debt and Equity Investments  


The Company has made investments in non-current debt and equity investments of public and privately held companies that have been reflected in the consolidated
balance sheets as long-term assets within other assets. They are not categorized as current assets either because, given their nature, they are not readily convertible into cash or because
they represent potentially longer-term investments by the Company. Further, the fair value of these investments has been subject to a high degree of volatility. The Company's
non-current debt and equity investments have been categorized as available-for-sale requiring that they be carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses,
net of taxes, reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. However, the Company recognizes an impairment charge to earnings in the event a decline in fair value below
the cost basis of one of these investments is determined to be other-than-temporary. The Company includes recognized gains and losses resulting from the sale or from
other-than-temporary declines in fair value associated with these investments in other income and expense. Occasionally, the Company uses short-term equity
derivatives to 


60






 


manage
potential dispositions of non-current debt and equity investments. Any gains or losses associated with such derivatives are recognized currently in other income and expense. 


Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity  


On May 15, 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 150, 
 
Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of
Both Liabilities and Equity
. SFAS No. 150 requires issuers to classify as
liabilities (or assets in some circumstances) certain freestanding financial instruments that embody obligations for the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The Company
adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 150 on June 29, 2003, which resulted in a favorable cumulative-effect type adjustment of approximately $3 million. This adjustment related to a
forward purchase agreement that allowed the Company to acquire 1.5 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $16.64 per share for a total cost of $25.5 million. The
Company settled this forward purchase agreement in August 2003, which resulted in an additional gain of approximately $6 million representing the increase in fair value of the agreement
from June 29, 2003 through the settlement date. 


Derivative Financial Instruments  


On October 1, 2000, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133, 
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities
. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, hedging activities, and exposure definition. SFAS No. 133
requires that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income. If the derivative is a hedge,
depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings, or
recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Net of the related income tax effect of approximately $5 million, adoption of SFAS No. 133
resulted in a favorable cumulative-effect type adjustment to net income of approximately $12 million. Net of the related income tax effect of approximately $5 million, adoption of SFAS
No. 133 resulted in a favorable cumulative-effect-type adjustment to other comprehensive income of approximately $12 million, all of which was reclassified to earnings during
2001. Management does not believe that ongoing application of SFAS No. 133 will significantly alter the Company's hedging strategies. However, its application may increase the volatility of
other income and expense and other comprehensive income. 


For
derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are attributable to a particular risk and that are designated as cash flow hedges, the net gain or
loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged
transaction affects earnings. To receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. For
derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability or an identified portion thereof that are attributable to a particular risk and that are
designated as fair value hedges, the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings
in the current period. The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure of the net
investment in a foreign operation is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For forward contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes
in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this component are recognized in current 


61






 




earnings.
For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in the current period. 


For
foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges, hedge effectiveness is measured based on changes in the fair value of the contract attributable to changes in the forward
exchange rate. Changes in the expected future cash flows on the forecasted hedged transaction and changes in the fair value of the forward hedge are both measured from the contract rate to the forward
exchange rate associated with the forward contract's maturity date. For currency option contracts, hedge effectiveness is measured based on changes in the total fair value of the option contract.
Hedge effectiveness is assessed by comparing the present value of the cumulative change in expected future cash flows on the hedged transaction to changes in expected cash flow of the option hedge at
maturity. The net gains or losses on derivative instruments qualifying as cash flow hedges are reported as components of other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity and reclassified into
earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any hedge ineffectiveness is recognized in current earnings in other income and expense. For interest rate
swap agreements qualifying as fair value hedges, the Company assumes no ineffectiveness because these swaps meet the criteria for accounting under the short-cut method defined in SFAS
No. 133. 


Inventories  


Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. If the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are
made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. 


Property, Plant, and Equipment  


Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use of the declining balance and straight-line methods over the estimated useful
lives of the assets, which are 30 years for buildings, from 2 to 5 years for equipment, and the shorter of lease terms or 10 years for leasehold improvements. The Company
capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related to internal-use
software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 5 years. 


Asset Retirement Obligations  


On September 29, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 143, 
Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations
, which
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. The standard applies to
legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. SFAS No. 143
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of
the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. All of the Company's existing asset retirement
obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. The Company estimated that as of September 29, 2002,
gross expected future cash flows of $9.5 million would be required to fulfill these obligations. 


62






 


As
of the date of adoption, the Company recorded a $6 million long-term asset retirement liability and a corresponding increase in leasehold improvements. This amount represents the
present value of expected future cash flows associated with returning certain of the Company's leased properties to original condition. The difference between the gross expected future cash flow of
$9.5 million and its present value of $6 million at September 29, 2002, is being accreted over the life of the related leases as an operating expense. Net of the related income
tax effect of approximately $1 million, adoption of SFAS No. 143 resulted in an unfavorable cumulative-effect type adjustment to net income during the first quarter of 2003 of
approximately $2 million. This adjustment represents cumulative depreciation and accretion that would have been recognized through the date of adoption of SFAS No. 143 had the statement
been applied to the Company's existing asset retirement obligations at the time they were initially incurred.

Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets  


The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to
generate. If property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the
assets exceeds its fair market value. For the three years ended September 27, 2003, the Company has made no material adjustments to its long-lived assets, except those made in
connection with the restructuring actions described in Note 5. 


The
Company adopted SFAS No. 142, 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
, in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. SFAS No. 142 requires that
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that they may be impaired. Prior to fiscal 2002, goodwill was amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life. The Company completed its transitional
goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2001, and its annual goodwill impairment tests at August 30, 2003 and August 30, 2002, respectively, and found no impairment. The Company
established reporting units based on its current reporting structure. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to
each reporting unit. 


SFAS
No. 142 also requires that intangible assets with definite lives be amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, 
 
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of
. The Company is currently
amortizing its acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods ranging from 3 to 10 years. 


Foreign Currency Translation  


The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its international non-U.S. functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at
the end of each period. Revenue and 


63






 


expenses
for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are credited or charged to foreign currency
translation included in "accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" in shareholders' equity. The Company's foreign manufacturing subsidiaries and certain other international subsidiaries that use
the U.S. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and inventories, property, and nonmonetary assets and
liabilities at historical rates. Gains and losses from these translations were insignificant and have been included in the Company's results of operations. 


Revenue Recognition  


Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of products (hardware, software, and peripherals), and extended warranty and support contracts. The Company recognizes
revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards, including Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97-2, 
Software Revenue Recognition
, as
amended, and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, 
Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements
. 


The
Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered
delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Company's product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped.
For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the United States, and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the
Company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed to not be,
fixed and determinable, revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable. 


Revenue
from extended warranty and support contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the warranty and support periods. These contracts typically include extended phone support, certain
repairs, web-based support resources, diagnostic tools, and extend the Company's one-year basic limited parts and labor warranty. 


The
Company sells software and peripheral products obtained from other companies. The Company establishes its own pricing and retains related inventory risk, is the primary obligor in sales
transactions with its customers, and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue for the sale of products obtained from other companies at
the gross amount billed. 


Revenue
on arrangements that include multiple elements such as hardware, software, and services is allocated to each element based on vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of the fair value of
each element. Allocated revenue for each element is recognized when revenue recognition criteria have been met for each element. VSOE is determined based on the price charged when each element is sold
separately. 


The
Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end user rebates, and other sales programs
and volume-based incentives. The estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue in the period the Company has sold the product and committed to a plan. The Company also records
reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company's historical experience. 


64






 




Generally,
the Company does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales or the sale of extended warranty and support contracts. However, a
limited number of the Company's software products are available with maintenance agreements that grant customers rights to unspecified future upgrades over the maintenance term on a when and if
available basis. Revenue associated with such maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term. 


Shipping Costs  


The Company's shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales for all periods presented. 


Warranty Expense  


The Company provides currently for the estimated cost for product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. 


Research and Development  


Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning
when a product's technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers pursuant to SFAS No. 86, 
Computer
Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed
. In most instances, the Company's products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. Therefore,
costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally all software development costs have been expensed. 


During
the third and fourth quarters of 2003, the Company incurred substantial development costs associated with the development of Mac OS X version 10.3 (code-named "Panther"), which
enhances the features and functionality of the previous version of Mac OS X, subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility as evidenced by public demonstration and release of a developer beta
in June 2003, and prior to release of the final version of the product in the first quarter of 2004. Therefore, during 2003 the Company capitalized approximately $14.7 million of
development costs associated with the development of Panther. Amortization of this asset began in the first quarter of 2004 when Panther was shipped and is being recognized on a
straight-line basis in accordance with SFAS No. 86 over a 3 year estimated useful life. 


During
the third and fourth quarters of 2002, the Company incurred substantial development costs associated with the development of Mac OS X version 10.2 (code-named "Jaguar") subsequent
to achievement of technological feasibility as evidenced by public demonstration and release of a developer beta in May 2002, and prior to release of the final version of the product in the
fourth quarter of 2002. As such, the Company capitalized approximately $13.3 million of development costs associated with development of Jaguar. Amortization of this asset began in the fourth
quarter of 2002 when Jaguar was shipped and is being recognized on a straight-line basis in accordance with SFAS No. 86 over a 3 year estimated useful life. In addition,
during 2002, the Company also began capitalizing certain costs related to development of its new PowerSchool enterprise student information system. Capitalization of approximately $6 million
began upon achievement of technological feasibility in the first quarter of 2002. The final version of the enterprise student information system was released in July 2002. 


During
2001 the Company incurred substantial development costs associated with the development of the original version of Mac OS X, subsequent to release of a public beta version of the product and
prior to release of the final product version. As a result, the Company capitalized approximately $5.4 million of development costs during 2001 associated with development of Mac OS X. Related
amortization is 


65






 




computed
by use of the straight-line method in accordance with SFAS No. 86 over a 8 year estimated useful life. 


Total
amortization related to capitalized software development costs was $5.8 million, $1.2 million and $350,000 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. 


Advertising Costs  


Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $193 million, $209 million, and $261 million for 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. 


Restructuring Charges  


In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, 
Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
. SFAS
No. 146 supersedes Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94-3, 
Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs
To Exit an Activity (Including Certain Costs Associated with a Restructuring)
 and requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be
recognized when the liability is incurred, as opposed to when management commits to an exit plan. SFAS No. 146 also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at
fair value. This Statement was effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The provisions of SFAS No. 146 were required to be applied prospectively after
the adoption date to newly initiated exit activities. 


Stock-Based Compensation  


The Company measures compensation expense for its employee stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB)
Opinion No. 25, 
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
 The Company applies the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123, 
 
Accounting for Stock-based
Compensation
, as amended by SFAS No. 148
, Accounting for Stock-based
CompensationTransition and Disclosure
 as if the fair value-based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense. The Company has elected to follow APB
Opinion No. 25 because, as discussed below, the alternative fair value accounting provided for under SFAS No. 123 requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use
in valuing employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares. Under APB Opinion No. 25, when the exercise price of the Company's employee stock options equals the market price of
the underlying stock on the date of the grant, no compensation expense is recognized. 


As
required under SFAS No. 123, the pro forma effects of stock-based compensation on net income and earnings per common share for employee stock options granted and employee stock purchase plan
purchases have been estimated at the date of grant and beginning of the period, respectively, using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair
value of the options and shares is amortized to pro forma net income over the options' vesting period and the shares' plan period. 


The
Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of freely traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option
valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected life of options and the Company's expected stock price volatility. Because the Company's employee stock
options and employee stock purchase plan shares have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially
affect the fair value estimate, in 


66






 


management's
opinion, the existing models do not provide a reliable measure of the fair value of the Company's employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares. 


For
purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options and shares is amortized to pro forma net income (loss) over the options' vesting period and the shares' plan period. The
Company's pro forma information for each of the last three fiscal years follows (in millions, except per share amounts):

Earnings Per Common Share  


Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period
increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of common stock had been issued. The dilutive effect of
outstanding options and restricted stock is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential shares of common stock related to stock options were
excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per common share for fiscal 2001 because their effect would have been antidilutive.

Options
to purchase 50.8 million and 58.0 million shares of common stock were outstanding at the end of 2003 and 2002, respectively, that were not included in the computation of diluted
earnings per share for that year because the options' exercise price was greater than the average market price of the Company's common shares for that year and, therefore, the effect would be
antidilutive. At September 29, 2001, the Company had options to purchase 97.2 million shares of its common stock outstanding, all of which were excluded from the computation of diluted
loss per share for 2001 because the effect would have been antidilutive. 


Comprehensive Income  


Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under
generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders' equity but are excluded from net income. The Company's other comprehensive income is comprised of foreign currency
translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as
available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges. 


Segment Information  


The Company reports segment information based on the "management" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions
and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments. Information about the Company's products, major customers, and geographic areas on a company-wide basis is
also disclosed.

The
Company's short-term investment portfolio consists of investments in U.S. Treasury and Agency securities, U.S. corporate securities, and foreign securities. The Company's U.S.
corporate securities consist primarily of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, time deposits and corporate debt securities. Foreign securities consist primarily of foreign commercial paper,
certificates of deposit and time deposits with foreign institutions, most of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company had net unrealized losses totaling $1 million on its investment
portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities greater than 1 year as of September 27, 2003 and net unrealized gains of $20 million on its investment
portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities greater than 1 year, as of September 28, 2002. The Company occasionally sells short-term investments prior
to their stated maturities. As a result of such sales, the Company recognized net gains of $21 million in 2003 and $7 million in 2002. These net gains were included in interest and other
income, net. 


As
of September 27, 2003, approximately $629 million of the Company's short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remaining
short-term investments as of September 27, 2003 had maturities of 3 to 12 months. As of September 28, 2002, approximately $1.087 billion of the Company's
short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remaining short-term investments as of September 28, 2002 had maturities of 3 to
12 months. 


Accounts Receivable  


Trade Receivables  


The Company distributes its products through third-party resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and commercial customers. The Company generally does not require
collateral from its customers. However, when possible the Company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe and Asia
and by arranging with third- 


69






 


party
financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the Company's direct customers. These credit financing arrangements are directly between the third-party
financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables that are
not covered by collateral, third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Company's distribution and retail channel partners. Trade receivables from a single customer,
Ingram Micro, Inc., accounted for approximately 10.3% and 10.8% of net accounts receivable as of September 27, 2003, and September 28, 2002, respectively.

Non-Trade Receivables  


The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors
who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these raw material components directly from suppliers. These non-trade
receivables, which are included in the consolidated balance sheets in other current assets, totaled $184 million and $142 million as of September 27, 2003, and
September 28, 2002, respectively. The Company does not recognize any profits on these sales or reflect the sale of these components in its net sales. 


Inventory Prepayment  


In April 2002, the Company made a $100 million prepayment to an Asian supplier for the purchase of components over the following nine months. In return for this
deposit, the supplier agreed to supply the Company with a specified level of components during the three consecutive fiscal quarters ended December 28, 2002. Approximately $53 million of
this deposit remained unused as of September 28, 2002 and was reflected in the consolidated balance sheets in other current assets. During the first six months of 2003, the remainder of the
deposit balance was fully utilized for the purchase of components. The deposit was unsecured and had no stated interest component. The Company imputed an amount to cost of sales and interest income
during each period the deposit was outstanding at a 3.25% interest rate to reflect the economics of this transaction. 


Derivative Financial Instruments  


The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. Foreign currency forward and option contracts are used to
offset the foreign exchange risk on certain existing assets and liabilities and to hedge the foreign exchange risk on expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenues and cost of sales. From
time to time, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate profile of certain investments and debt. The Company's 


70






 


accounting
policies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at
fair value. 


The
following table shows the notional principal, net fair value, and credit risk amounts of the Company's foreign currency instruments as of September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002

The
notional principal amounts for derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of year-end, and do not represent the amount of the Company's
exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amount shown in the table above represents the Company's gross exposure to potential accounting loss on these transactions if all counterparties
failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency exchange rates at each respective date. The Company's exposure to credit loss and market risk will
vary over time as a function of currency exchange rates. 


The
estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models using prevailing financial market information as of September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002. In
certain instances where judgment is required in estimating fair value, price quotes were obtained from several of the Company's counterparty financial institutions. Although the table above reflects
the notional principal, fair value, and credit risk amounts of the Company's foreign exchange instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that
the foreign exchange instruments
are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market
conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. 


Foreign Exchange Risk Management  


The Company enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions primarily to protect against foreign exchange risk associated with existing
assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions and certain probable but not firmly committed transactions. Generally, the Company's practice is to hedge a majority of its existing
material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular
exposures, or limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments. 


71






 


In
accordance with SFAS No. 133, hedges related to probable but not firmly committed transactions of an anticipatory nature are designated and documented at hedge inception as cash flow hedges
and evaluated for hedge effectiveness quarterly. For currency forward contracts, hedge effectiveness is measured based on changes in the total fair value of the contract attributable to changes in the
forward exchange rate. Changes in the expected future cash flows on the forecasted hedged transaction and changes in the fair value of the forward hedge are both measured from the contract rate to the
forward exchange rate associated with the forward contract's maturity date. 


For
currency option contracts, hedge effectiveness is measured based on changes in the total fair value of the option contract. Hedge effectiveness is assessed by comparing the present value of the
cumulative change in expected future cash flows on the hedged transaction to changes in expected cash flow of the option hedge at maturity. The net gains or losses on derivative instruments qualifying
as cash flow hedges are reported as components of other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction
affects earnings. Any hedge ineffectiveness is recognized in current earnings in other income and expense. 


To
protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company's U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenues, and the
Company's non-U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries selling in local currencies hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries' functional currency.
Other comprehensive income associated with hedges of foreign currency revenues is recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related sales are recognized, and other comprehensive
income related to inventory purchases is recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Typically, the Company hedges portions of its forecasted
foreign currency exposure associated with revenues and inventory purchases over a time horizon of 3 to 9 months. 


The
Company also enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain recorded assets and
liabilities in non-functional currencies. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in current earnings in other income and expense as offsets to the changes in the
fair value of the related assets or liabilities. 


The
Company may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to offset the translation and economic exposure of a net investment position in a foreign subsidiary. Hedge effectiveness on forwards
designated as net investment hedges is measured based on changes in the fair value of the contract attributable to changes in the spot exchange rate. The effective portion of the net gain or loss on a
derivative instrument designated as a hedge of the net investment position in a foreign subsidiary is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. Any residual changes in
fair value of the forward contract, including changes in fair value based on the differential between the spot and forward exchange rates, are recognized in current earnings in other income and
expense. 


As
discussed above, the Company enters into foreign currency option contracts as items that provide an offset to the re-measurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities denominated
in non-functional currencies. All changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts based on changes in option time value are recorded in current earnings in other income and
expense. Due to market movements, changes in option time value can lead to increased volatility in other income and expense. 


Derivative
instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable that the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified
time period or within a subsequent 2 month time period. Deferred gains and losses in other comprehensive income associated with 


72






 




such
derivative instruments are immediately reclassified into earnings in other income and expense. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are also reflected in current
earnings unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. During 2002, the Company recorded net gains of $2.5 million in other income and expense related to the loss
of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges due to changes in the Company's forecast of future net sales and cost of sales and due to prevailing market conditions. During 2001, the Company
recorded a net gain of $5.1 million in other income and expense related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges due to changes in the Company's forecast of future net
sales and cost of sales. No net gains, or losses, of a similar nature were recorded in 2003. 


Interest Rate Risk Management  


The Company sometimes enters into interest rate derivative transactions, including interest rate swaps, collars, and floors, with financial institutions in order to better
match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on its
long-term debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the Company's exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. 


As
of September 30, 2000, the Company had entered into interest rate swaps with financial institutions in order to better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its
cash equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on its long-term debt, and to diversify a portion of the Company's exposure away
from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. The interest rate swaps generally required the Company to pay a floating interest rate based on the three- or six-month
U.S. dollar LIBOR and receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of the underlying notional amounts. These swaps effectively converted the Company's fixed-rate 10-year
debt to floating-rate debt and converted a portion of the floating rate investments to fixed rate. The Company assumed no ineffectiveness with regard to the debt interest swaps as each
debt interest rate swap met the criteria for accounting under the short-cut method defined in SFAS No. 133 for fair value hedges of debt instruments. Accordingly, no net gains or
losses were recorded in income relative to the Company's underlying debt interest rate swaps. During fiscal 2001, the Company closed out all of its existing debt interest rate swap positions due to
prevailing market interest rates realizing a gain of $17 million. This gain was deferred, recognized in long-term debt and is being amortized to other income and expense over the
remaining life of the debt. 


The
unrealized loss on the asset swaps as of September 30, 2000, of $5.7 million was deferred and then recognized in income in 2001 as part of the SFAS No. 133 transition
adjustment effective on October 1, 2000. The Company closed out all of its existing interest rate asset swaps during 2001 realizing a gain of $1.1 million. 


As
of September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002, the Company had no interest rate derivatives outstanding. Due to perceived market risk, the Company entered into interest rate swaps in
early 2002. The interest rate swaps required the Company to pay a floating interest rate based on six-month U.S. dollar LIBOR and receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of the
underlying notional amounts. These swaps effectively converted the Company's fixed-rate 10-year debt to floating-rate debt. The Company assumed no ineffectiveness
with regard to the debt interest swaps as each debt interest rate swap met the criteria for accounting under the short-cut method defined in SFAS No. 133 for fair value hedges of
debt instruments. Accordingly, no net gains or losses were recorded in income relative to the Company's underlying debt interest rate swaps during fiscal 2002 until the Company closed out the
positions in late 2002 due to prevailing market interest rates. Closing the debt interest rate swaps resulted in a realized gain 


73






 




of
$6 million. This gain was deferred, recognized in long-term debt and is being amortized to other income and expense over the remaining life of the debt. 


Debt  


The Company currently has debt outstanding in the form of $300 million of aggregate principal amount 6.5% unsecured notes that were originally issued in 1994. The notes,
which pay interest semiannually, were sold at 99.925% of par, for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. The notes, along with approximately $4 million of related unamortized deferred gains
on closed interest rate swaps, are due in February of 2004 and therefore have been classified as current debt as of September 27, 2003. As of September 27, 2003 and September 28,
2002, the carrying amount of these notes, including unamortized deferred gains associated with closed debt interest rate swaps, was $304 million and $316 million, respectively, while the
fair value was $302 million and $299 million, respectively. The fair value of the notes is based on their listed market values as of September 27, 2003 and September 28,
2002. 


Non-Current Debt and Equity Investments and Related Gains and Losses  


The Company has held investments in EarthLink, Inc. (EarthLink), Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai), ARM Holdings plc (ARM), and Samsung Electronics
Co., Ltd (Samsung). These investments have been reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as long term assets within other assets and have been categorized as
available-for-sale requiring that they be carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in equity as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income. All realized gains on the sale of these investments have been included in total other income and expense. The combined fair value of these investments held by the Company was
$5 million and $39 million as of September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002, respectively. 


EarthLink  


In January 2000, the Company invested $200 million in EarthLink, an Internet service provider (ISP). The investment was in EarthLink's Series C Convertible
Preferred Stock, which was convertible by the Company after January 4, 2001, into approximately 7.1 million shares of EarthLink common stock. Concurrent with this investment, EarthLink
and the Company entered into a multi-year agreement to deliver ISP service to Macintosh users in the United States. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company profits from each new Mac
customer that subscribes to EarthLink's ISP service for a specified period of time, and EarthLink is the default ISP in the Company's Internet Setup Software included with all Macintosh computers sold
in the United States. 


During
the first quarter of 2003, the Company sold 2,580,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds of approximately $13.7 million, an amount that approximated the Company's carrying value
of the shares. During the third quarter of 2003, the Company sold all of its remaining holdings in EarthLink, consisting of 3,960,000 shares of stock for net proceeds of approximately
$23 million, and a gain before taxes of $2 million. 


During
the first quarter of 2002, the Company sold 117,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds of $2 million and a gain before taxes of $223,000. No sales of EarthLink were made in any
of the subsequent quarters of fiscal 2002. However, during the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company determined that the then current decline in the fair value of its investment in EarthLink was
other-than-temporary. As a result, the Company recognized a $44 million charge to earnings to write-down the basis of its investment in EarthLink to
$35 million. This charge was included in gains (losses) on non-current investments, net. As of September 28, 2002, the Company held 6.5 million shares of EarthLink
stock valued at $35 million. 


74






 




During
the second quarter of 2001, the Company determined that the decline in the fair value of its investment in EarthLink was other-than-temporary requiring that its cost
basis be written down to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write-down be included in earnings. As a result, the Company recognized a $114 million charge to
earnings to write-down the basis of its investment in EarthLink to $86 million. This charge was included in gains (losses) on non-current investments, net. During the
fourth quarter of 2001, the Company sold a total of approximately 425,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds of approximately $6 million, recorded a gain before taxes of approximately
$800,000, and recognized related income tax of approximately $200,000. 


Akamai  


In June 1999, the Company invested $12.5 million in Akamai, a global Internet content delivery service. The investment was in the form of convertible preferred
stock that converted into 4.1 million shares of Akamai common stock (adjusted for subsequent stock splits) at the time of Akamai's initial public
offering in October 1999. Beginning in the first quarter of 2000, the Company categorized its shares in Akamai as available-for-sale. 


During
the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company sold 1,875,000 shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of $9 million and a gain before taxes of $8 million. As of September 27,
2003, the Company's remaining investment in Akamai consists of 986,000 shares of Akamai stock valued at $5 million. 


During
the first quarter of 2002, the Company sold 250,000 shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of $2 million and a gain before taxes of $710,000. No sales of Akamai were made in any of the
subsequent quarters of fiscal 2002. However, during the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company determined that the decline in the fair value of its investment in Akamai was
other-than-temporary. As a result, the Company recognized a $6 million charge to earnings to write-down the basis of its investment in Akamai to
$3 million. This charge was included in gains (losses) on non-current investments, net. As of September 28, 2002, the Company held 2.9 million shares of Akamai stock
valued at $3 million. 


During
2001, the Company sold a total of approximately 1 million shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of approximately $39 million and recorded a gain before taxes of approximately
$36 million. 


ARM  


ARM is a publicly held company in the United Kingdom involved in the design and licensing of high performance microprocessors and related technology. 


During
the third quarter of 2003, the Company sold all of its remaining holdings in ARM stock, consisting of 278,000 shares for net proceeds of approximately $295,000, and a gain before taxes of
$270,000. 


During
the first quarter of 2002, the Company sold 4.7 million shares of ARM stock for both net proceeds and a gain before taxes of $21 million. No sales of ARM were made in any of the
subsequent quarters of fiscal 2002. As of September 28, 2002, the Company held 278,000 shares of ARM stock valued at $578,000. 


During
2001, the Company sold a total of approximately 29.8 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of approximately $176 million, recorded a gain before taxes of approximately
$174 million, and recognized related income tax expense of approximately $52 million.

Samsung  


During the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company invested $100 million in Samsung to assist in the further expansion of Samsung's TFT-LCD
flat-panel display production capacity. The investment was in the form of three year unsecured bonds, which were convertible into approximately 550,000 shares of Samsung common stock
beginning in July 2000. The bonds carried an annual coupon rate of 2% and paid a total yield to maturity of 5% if redeemed at maturity. 


Prior
to its sale, the Company had categorized its investment in Samsung as available-for-sale requiring that it be carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net
of taxes, reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The fair value of the Company's investment in Samsung was approximately $123 million as of
September 30, 2000. With the adoption of SFAS No. 133 on October 1, 2000, the Company was required to account for the conversion option embedded in the Samsung bonds separately
from the related debt. The conversion feature was carried at fair value with any changes in fair value recognized in earnings in the period in which they occur. Included in the $17 million
gross SFAS No. 133 transition adjustment recorded in earnings during the first quarter of fiscal 2001 was a $23 million favorable adjustment for the restatement to fair value as of
October 1, 2000, of the derivative component of the Company's investment in Samsung. To adjust the carrying value of the derivative component of its investment in Samsung to fair value as of
December 30, 2000, the Company recognized an unrealized loss of approximately $13 million during the first quarter of 2001. During the second quarter of 2001, the Company sold this
investment for book value, including accrued interest, and received net proceeds of approximately $117 million. 


Other Strategic Investments  


The Company has made additional minority debt and equity investments in several privately held technology companies, which were reflected in the consolidated balance sheets in
other assets. These investments were inherently risky because the products and/or markets of these companies were typically not fully developed. During 2002 and 2001, the Company determined that the
decline in fair value of certain of these investments was other-than-temporary and, accordingly, recognized a charge to earnings of $15 million and $8 million,
respectively. These charges
were included in gains (losses) on non-current investments, net. As of September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002, the Company had no private debt or equity investments
reflected in its consolidated balance sheets.

Acquisition of Emagic GmbH  


During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company acquired Emagic GmbH (Emagic), a provider of professional software solutions for computer based music production, for
approximately $30 million in cash; $26 million of which was paid immediately upon closing of the deal and $4 million of which was held-back for future payment
contingent on continued employment by certain employees that will be allocated to future compensation expense in the appropriate periods over the next 3 years. During fiscal 2003, contingent
consideration totaling $1.3 million was paid. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase. The portion of the purchase price allocated to purchased in-process research and
development (IPR&D) was expensed immediately, and the portion of the purchase price allocated to acquired technology and to tradename will be amortized over their estimated useful lives of
3 years. Goodwill associated with the acquisition of Emagic is not subject to amortization pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 142. Total consideration was allocated as follows (in
millions):

The
amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition, because the technological feasibility of products under development had not been established and no alternative
future uses existed. The IPR&D relates primarily to Emagic's Logic series technology and extensions. At the date of the acquisition, the products under development were between 43%-83%
complete, and it was expected that the remaining work would be completed during the Company's fiscal 2003 at a cost of approximately $415,000. The remaining efforts, which were completed in 2003,
included finalizing user interface design and development, and testing. The fair value of the IPR&D was determined using an income approach, which reflects the projected free cash flows that will be
generated by the IPR&D projects and that are attributable to the acquired technology, and discounting the projected net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 25%. 


Acquisition of certain assets of Zayante, Inc., Prismo Graphics, and Silicon Grail  


During fiscal 2002 the Company acquired certain technology and patent rights of Zayante, Inc., Prismo Graphics, and Silicon Grail Corporation for a total of
$20 million in cash. These transactions have been accounted for as asset acquisitions. The purchase price for these asset acquisitions, except for $1 million identified as contingent
consideration which will be allocated to compensation expense over the next 3 years, has been allocated to acquired technology and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over
3 years, except for certain assets acquired from Zayante associated with patent royalty streams that will be amortized over 10 years. 


Acquisition of Nothing Real, LLC  


During the second quarter of 2002, the Company acquired certain assets of Nothing Real, LLC (Nothing Real), a privately-held company that develops and markets high
performance tools designed for the digital image creation market. Of the $15 million purchase price, the Company has allocated $7 million to acquired technology, which will be amortized
over its estimated life of 5 years. The remaining $8 million, which has been identified as contingent consideration, rather than recorded as an additional component of the cost of the
acquired assets, will be allocated to future compensation expense in the appropriate periods over the next 3 years. 


Acquisition of Spruce Technologies, Inc.  


In July 2001, the Company acquired Spruce Technologies, Inc. (Spruce), a privately-held company that develops and markets DVD authoring products, for
$14.9 million in cash. Goodwill associated with the acquisition of Spruce is not subject to amortization pursuant to the transition provisions of SFAS No. 142. The consolidated financial
statements include the operating results of Spruce from the date of acquisition. Total consideration was allocated as follows (in millions):

Acquisition of PowerSchool, Inc.  


In May 2001, the Company acquired PowerSchool, Inc. (PowerSchool), a provider of web-based student information systems for K-12 schools
and districts that enable schools to record, access, report, and manage their student data and performance in real-time, and gives parents real-time web access to track 


80






 


their
children's progress. The consolidated financial statements include the operating results of PowerSchool from the date of acquisition. 


The
purchase price of approximately $66.1 million consisted of the issuance of approximately 2.4 million shares of the Company's common stock with a fair value of $61.2 million,
the issuance of stock options with a fair value of $4.5 million, and $300,000 of direct transaction costs. The fair value of the common stock options issued was determined using a Black-Scholes
option pricing model with the following assumptions: volatility of 67%, expected life of 4 years, dividend rate of 0%, and risk-free rate of 4.73%. 


Total
consideration was allocated as follows (in millions):

The
amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition, because the technological feasibility of products under development had not been established and no alternative
future uses existed. The IPR&D relates to technologies representing processes and expertise employed to design, develop, and deploy a functioning, scalable web-based student information
system for use by K-12 schools. At the date of the acquisition, the product under development was approximately 50% complete, and it was expected that the remaining 50% would be completed
during the Company's fiscal 2002 at a cost of approximately $9.25 million. The remaining efforts, which were completed in 2002, included completion of coding, finalizing user interface design
and development, and testing. The fair value of the IPR&D was determined using an income approach, which reflects the projected free cash flows that will be generated by the IPR&D projects and that
are attributable to the acquired technology, and discounting the projected net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 25%. The acquired intangibles are being amortized over
their estimated useful lives of 3 years. Deferred stock compensation associated with restricted stock and options is being amortized over the required future vesting period of 3 years. 


In
the fourth quarter of 2001, an adjustment was made to increase goodwill associated with the acquisition of PowerSchool by $5.9 million due to the identification of previously unidentified
loss contingencies that were in existence prior to consummation of the acquisition. 


The
Company allocated $12.8 million of its purchase consideration for PowerSchool to deferred stock compensation within shareholders' equity. This amount represented the intrinsic value of
stock options assumed that vest as future services are provided by employees and related to 445,000 common shares issued contingent on continued employment of certain PowerSchool employee
stockholders. Certain PowerSchool employee stockholders were terminated in the first quarter of 2003 resulting in the $5 million recognition of previously deferred stock compensation as part of
the Company's first quarter restructuring action. Unamortized PowerSchool related deferred stock compensation of approximately $294,000 remains as of September 27, 2003.

Note 5Restructuring Charges  


Fiscal 2003 Restructuring Actions  


The Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $26.8 million during the year ended September 27, 2003, including approximately
$7.4 million in severance costs, a $5.0 million charge to write-off deferred compensation, $7.1 million in asset impairments and a $7.3 million
charge for lease cancellations. Of the $26.8 million, nearly all had been spent by the end of 2003, except for approximately $400,000 of severance costs and approximately $4.5 million
related to operating lease costs on abandoned facilities. During the third quarter of 2003, approximately $500,000 of the amount originally accrued for lease cancellations was determined to be in
excess due to the sublease of a property sooner than originally estimated and an approximately $500,000 shortfall was identified in the severance accrual due to higher than expected severance costs
related to the closure of the Company's Singapore manufacturing operations. These adjustments had no net effect on reported operating expense. 


During
the second quarter of 2003, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions that resulted in recognition of a total restructuring charge of $2.8 million, including
$2.4 million in severance costs and $400,000 for asset write-offs and lease payments on an abandoned facility. Actions taken in the second quarter were for the most part
supplemental to actions initiated in the prior two quarters and focused on further headcount reductions in various sales and marketing functions in the Company's Americas and Europe operating segments
and further reductions associated with PowerSchool-related activities in the Americas operating segment, including an accrual for asset write-offs and lease payments on an abandoned
facility. The second quarter actions resulted in the termination of 93 employees, 92 were terminated prior to the end of 2003. 


During
the first quarter of 2003, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of $24 million that resulted in the termination of manufacturing
operations at the Company-owned facility in Singapore, further reductions in headcount resulting from the shift in PowerSchool product strategy that took place at the end of fiscal 2002, and
termination of various sales and marketing activities in the United States and Europe. These restructuring actions will ultimately result in the elimination of 260 positions worldwide, all but one of
which were eliminated by the end of 2003. 


Closure
of the Company's Singapore manufacturing operations resulted in severance costs of $1.8 million and costs of $6.7 million to write-off manufacturing related fixed
assets, whose use ceased during the first quarter. PowerSchool related costs included severance of approximately $550,000 and recognition of $5 million of previously deferred stock compensation
that arose when PowerSchool was acquired by the 


82






 




Company
in 2001 related to certain PowerSchool employee stockholders who were terminated in the first quarter of 2003. Termination of sales and marketing activities and employees, principally in the
United States and Europe, resulted in severance costs of $2.8 million and accrual of costs associated with operating leases on closed facilities of $6.7 million. The total net
restructuring charge of $23 million recognized during the first quarter of 2003 also reflects the reversal of $600,000 of unused restructuring accrual originally made during the first quarter
of 2002. 


Except
for certain costs associated with operating leases on closed facilities, the Company currently anticipates that all of the remaining accrual for severance costs of approximately $400,000 will
be spent by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2004.

Fiscal 2002 Restructuring Actions  


During fiscal 2002, the Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $30 million related to actions intended to eliminate certain activities and better
align the Company's operating expenses with existing general economic conditions and to partially offset the cost of continuing investments in new product development and investments in the Company's
Retail operating segment. 


During
the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of approximately $6 million designed to reduce headcount costs in
corporate operations and sales and to adjust its PowerSchool product strategy. These restructuring actions resulted in the elimination of approximately 180 positions worldwide at a cost of
$1.8 million, all of which were eliminated by September 27, 2003. Eliminated positions were primarily in corporate operations, sales, and PowerSchool related research and development in
the Americas operating segment. The shift in product strategy at PowerSchool included discontinuing development and marketing of PowerSchool's PSE product. This shift resulted in the impairment of
previously capitalized development costs associated with the PSE product in the amount of $4.5 million. 


During
the first quarter of 2002, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of approximately $24 million. These restructuring actions resulted in
the elimination of approximately 425 positions worldwide at a cost of $8 million. Positions were eliminated primarily in the Company's operations, information systems, and administrative
functions. In addition, these restructuring actions also included significant changes in the Company's information systems strategy resulting in termination of equipment leases and cancellation of
existing projects and activities. The Company ceased using the assets associated with first quarter 2002 restructuring actions during that same quarter. Related lease and contract cancellation charges
totaled $12 million, and charges for asset impairments totaled 


83






 




$4 million.
The first quarter 2002 restructuring actions were primarily related to corporate activity not allocated to operating segments. During the first quarter of 2003, the Company reversed
the remaining unused accrual of $600,000.

The
foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pretax earnings of approximately $250 million, $284 million and $363 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. As
of September 27, 2003, approximately $2.5 billion of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based
in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries would be subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the United States. The Company's consolidated financial statements
fully provide for any related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated, aside from undistributed earnings of certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be indefinitely
reinvested in operations outside the United States. U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $822 million of such earnings. It is not practicable to determine the
income tax liability that might be incurred if these earnings were to be distributed. 


Deferred
tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits, and the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts
of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected
to be recovered or settled. 


As
of September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002, the significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in millions):

As
of September 27, 2003, the Company had operating loss carryforwards for federal tax purposes of approximately $189 million, which expire from 2011 through 2023. A portion of these
carryforwards was acquired from NeXT and other acquisitions, the utilization of which is subject to certain limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The Company also has Federal credit
carryforwards and various state and foreign tax loss and credit carryforwards, the tax effect of which is approximately $117 million and which expire between 2004 and 2023. The remaining
benefits from tax losses and credits do not expire. As of September 27, 2003, a valuation allowance of $30 million was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax
losses that may not be realized. The valuation allowance relates primarily to the operating loss carryforwards acquired from NeXT and other acquisitions. Management believes it is more likely than not
that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax

planning
strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. 


A
reconciliation of the provision for income taxes, with the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate (35% in 2003, 2002, and 2001) to income (loss) before provision for
(benefit from) income taxes, is as follows (in millions):

On
April 10, 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) completed its audit of the Company's federal income tax returns for the years 1998 through 2000 and proposed certain adjustments. Certain
of these adjustments are being contested through the IRS Appeals Office. Substantially all IRS audit issues for years prior to 1998 have been resolved. Management believes that adequate provision has
been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. Should any issues addressed in the Company's tax audits be
resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs. 


Note 7Shareholders' Equity  


CEO Restricted Stock Award  


On March 19, 2003, the Company entered into an Option Cancellation and Restricted Stock Award Agreement (the Agreement) with Steven P. Jobs, its Chief Executive Officer
(CEO). The Agreement cancelled stock option awards for the purchase of 27.5 million shares of the Company's common stock previously granted to Mr. Jobs in 2000 and 2001. Mr. Jobs
retained options to purchase 60,000 shares of the Company's common stock granted in August of 1997 in his capacity as a member of the Company's Board of Directors, prior to becoming the Company's CEO.
The Agreement replaced the cancelled options with a restricted stock award of 5 million shares of the Company's common stock. The restricted stock award generally vests three years from date of
grant. Vesting of some or all of the restricted shares will be accelerated in the event Mr. Jobs is terminated without cause, dies, or has his management role reduced following a change in
control of the Company. 


The
Company has recorded the value of the restricted stock award of $74.75 million as a component of shareholders' equity and is amortizing that amount on a straight-line basis over
the 3-year service/vesting period. The value of the restricted stock award was based on the closing market price of the Company's 


86






 




common
stock on the date of the award. Total amortization of approximately $13 million has been included in selling, general, and administrative expense in 2003 and will continue to be included
at approximately $6.2 million per quarter through March 2006. The 5 million restricted shares have been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share utilizing the
treasury stock method. 


Stock Repurchase Plan  


In July 1999, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does
not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time. 


During
the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company entered into a forward purchase agreement to acquire 1.5 million shares of its common stock in September of 2003 at an average price of $16.64 per
share for a total cost of $25.5 million. In August 2003, the Company settled this agreement prior to its maturity, at which time the Company's common stock had a fair value of $22.81.
Other than this forward purchase transaction, the Company has not engaged in any transactions to repurchase its common stock since fiscal 2000. Since inception of the stock repurchase plan, the
Company had repurchased a total of 6.55 million shares at a cost of $217 million. The Company was authorized to repurchase up to an additional $283 million of its common stock as
of September 27, 2003. 


Preferred Stock  


In August 1997, the Company and Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft) entered into patent cross license and technology agreements. In addition, Microsoft purchased 150,000
shares of Apple Series A nonvoting convertible preferred stock ("preferred stock") for $150 million. These shares were convertible by Microsoft after August 5, 2000, into shares
of the Company's common stock at a conversion price of $8.25 per share. During 2000, 74,250 shares of preferred stock were converted to 9 million shares of the Company's common stock. During
2001, the remaining 75,750 preferred shares were converted into 9.2 million shares of the Company's common stock. 


Comprehensive Income  


Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under
generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders' equity but are excluded from net income. The Company's other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency
translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as
available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges. 


The
following table summarizes the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes (in millions):

Note 8Employee Benefit Plans  


2003 Employee Stock Option Plan  


At the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on April 24, 2003, the shareholders approved an amendment to the 1998 Executive Officer Stock Plan to change the name of the
plan to the 2003 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 2003 Plan), to provide for broad-based grants to all employees in addition to executive officers and other key employees and to prohibit future
"repricings" of employee stock options, including
6-months-plus-1-day option exchange programs, without shareholder approval. Based on the terms of individual option grants, options granted under the
2003 Plan generally expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment, with either annual or quarterly
vesting. The 2003 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, and stock purchase rights. 


1997 Employee Stock Option Plan  


In August 1997, the Company's Board of Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 1997 Plan), a non-shareholder approved plan for grants of
stock options to employees who are not officers of the Company. Options may be granted under the 1997 Plan to employees at not less than the fair market value on the date of grant. Based on the terms
of individual option grants, options granted under the 1997 


88






 


Plan
generally expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment, with either annual or quarterly
vesting. As a result of shareholder approval of amendments to the 1998 Executive Officer Stock Plan in April 2003, the Company terminated the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan and cancelled all
remaining unissued shares, following the completion of an employee stock option exchange program in October 2003. 


Employee Stock Option Exchange Program  


On March 20, 2003, the Company announced a voluntary employee stock option exchange program (the Exchange Program) whereby eligible employees, other than executive
officers and members of the Board of Directors, had an opportunity to exchange outstanding options with exercise prices at or above $25.00 per share for a predetermined smaller number of new stock
options issued with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of one share of the Company's common stock on the day the new awards are issued, which would be at least six months plus one day
after the exchange options are cancelled. On April 17, 2003, in accordance with the Exchange Program, the Company accepted and cancelled options to purchase 16,569,193 shares of its common
stock. On October 22, 2003, new stock options totaling 6,697,368 shares were issued to employees at an exercise price of $22.76 per share, which is equivalent to the closing price of the
Company's stock on that date. No financial or accounting impact to the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flow was associated with this transaction. 


1997 Director Stock Option Plan  


In August 1997, the Company's Board of Directors adopted a shareholder approved Director Stock Option Plan (DSOP) for non-employee directors of the Company.
Initial grants of 30,000 options under the DSOP vest in three equal installments on each of the first through third
anniversaries of the date of grant, and subsequent annual grants of 10,000 options are fully vested at grant. 


Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans  


Certain of the Company's executive officers, including Mr. Timothy D. Cook and Mr. Fred D. Anderson, have entered into trading plans pursuant to
Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. A trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula
for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of Apple stock including the exercise and sale of employee stock options and shares acquired pursuant to the Company's
Employee Stock Purchase Plan. 


Employee Stock Purchase Plan  


The Company has a shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan (the Purchase Plan), under which substantially all employees may purchase common stock through payroll
deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values as of the beginning and end of six-month offering periods. Stock purchases under the Purchase Plan are limited to
10% of an employee's compensation, up to a maximum of $25,000 in any calendar year. In the third quarter of 2003, the Company's shareholders also approved an amendment to the Employee Stock Purchase
Plan to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance by 4 million shares. Beginning with the six-month offering period that started on June 30, 2003, the number of
shares authorized for issuance is limited to a total of 1 million shares per offering period. During 2003, 2002, and 2001, 2.1 million, 1.8 million and 1.8 million shares,
respectively, were issued under the Purchase Plan. As of September 27, 2003, approximately 4.0 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan. 


89






 


Employee Savings Plan  


The Company has an employee savings plan (the Savings Plan) qualifying as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the
Savings Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limit ($12,000 for calendar year 2003). The
Company matches 50% to 100% of each employee's contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employee's earnings. The Company's matching contributions to the Savings Plan
were approximately $21 million, $19 million, and $17 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.

September 29, 2001, the Company had exercisable options to purchase 42.1 million shares outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $32.15. 


Note 9Stock-Based Compensation  


The
Company has provided pro forma disclosures in Note 1 of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the effect on net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share as if the fair
value method of accounting for stock compensation had been used for its employee stock option grants and employee stock purchase plan purchases. These pro forma effects have been estimated at the date
of grant and beginning of the period, respectively, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. 


For
purposes of the pro forma disclosures provided pursuant to SFAS No. 123, the option awards issued in October 2003 and the awards cancelled as part of the Exchange Program have been
accounted for using modification accounting. In accordance with SFAS No. 123, the grant date of the awards issued is the date of acceptance of the exchange offer by participating employees. The
cancellation of certain of the Company's Chief Executive Officer's options and replacement with restricted shares in March 2003 is also being accounted for using modification accounting for
purposes of the pro forma disclosures provided pursuant to SFAS No. 123.

For
purposes of the pro forma disclosures provided pursuant to SFAS No. 123, the expected volatility assumptions used by the Company prior to the third quarter of 2003 have been based solely on
the historical volatility of the Company's common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Company's stock options. Beginning in the third quarter of
2003, the Company has modified this approach to consider other relevant factors including implied volatility in market traded options on the Company's common stock and the impact of unusual
fluctuations not reasonably expected to recur on the historical volatility of the Company's common stock. The Company will continue to monitor these and other relevant factors in developing the
expected volatility assumption used to value future awards. 


Beginning
in the third quarter of 2003, the Company shortened its estimate of the expected life of new options granted to its employees from 4 years to 3.5 years. The Company bases its
expected life assumption on its historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock options it grants to employees. The change in the expected life assumption made during the third
quarter of 2003 was the result of the expected impact of shortening the contractual life of new options granted to employees from 10 years to 7 years and changing the vesting provisions
of new options granted to employees from 4 year straight-line annual vesting to 4 year straight-line quarterly vesting.

The Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any other
off-balance-sheet financing arrangements. The major facility leases are for terms of 5 to 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of 3 to 5 additional years. Leases
for retail space are for terms of 5 to 15 years and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of September 27, 2003, the Company's total future minimum lease payments
under noncancelable operating leases were $600 million, of which $354 million related to leases for retail space. 


Rent
expense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $97 million, $92 million, and $80 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.

Accrued Warranty and Indemnifications  


The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period for hardware products is typically one year from the date of
purchase by the end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for Apple software and for Apple service parts used to repair Apple hardware products. The Company
provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product warranties at the time related revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate
accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical warranty claim rates, historical and projected
cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company's typical experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting warranty
liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future expectations.

The
Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property
rights. Other licensing agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an
infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted
against itself or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims that would have a material adverse effect
on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Therefore, the Company did not record a liability for infringement costs as of either September 27, 2003 or September 28,
2002.

Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product  


Although certain components essential to the Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, other key components (including microprocessors and
application-specific integrated circuits, or ("ASICs")) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some other key components, while currently available to the Company from
multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide availability and pricing pressures. In addition, the Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal
computer industry, and new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for and
subsequently qualifies additional suppliers. If the supply of a key single-sourced component to the Company were to be delayed or curtailed or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays shipments
of completed products to the Company, the Company's ability to ship related products in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely affected. The Company's business and financial
performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an
alternative source. Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to
meet the Company's requirements. Finally, significant portions of the Company's CPUs, logic boards, and assembled products are now manufactured by outsourcing partners, the majority of which occurs in
various parts of Asia. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company's operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing
partners were unable to meet their production obligations. 


Contingencies  


Beginning on September 27, 2001, three shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against
the Company and its Chief Executive Officer. These lawsuits are substantially identical, and purport to bring suit on behalf of persons who purchased the Company's publicly traded common stock between
July 19, 2000, and September 28, 2000. The complaints allege violations of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. The Company
believes these claims are without merit and intends to defend them vigorously. The Company filed a motion to dismiss on June 4, 2002, which was heard by the Court on September 13, 2002.
On December 11, 2002, the Court granted the Company's
motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action, with leave to Plaintiffs to amend their complaint within thirty days. Plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on January 31, 2003, and
on March 17, 2003, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The Court heard the Company's motion on July 11, 2003 and dismissed Plaintiff's claims with prejudice on
August 12, 2003. Plaintiffs have appealed the ruling. 


The
Company is subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully adjudicated. In the opinion of management, the Company
does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity
or results of operations. However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these
legal matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. 


Production
and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers 


94






 




the
ability to return product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been
passed in several jurisdictions that the Company operates including various European Union member countries, Japan and California. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse affects
in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's
results of operations and financial position. 


Note 11Segment Information and Geographic Data  


The
Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas segment includes both North
and South America, except for the activities of the Company's Retail segment. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Japan segment includes only
Japan. As of September 27, 2003, the Retail segment currently operates Apple-owned retail stores in the United States. Other operating segments include Asia-Pacific, which includes
Australia and Asia except for Japan, and the Company's subsidiary, Filemaker, Inc. Each reportable operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services, and
the accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1, except as described below for the Retail segment. 


The
Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales. The Retail segment's performance is also evaluated based on operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are
based on the location of the customers. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment.
Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses that are managed outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various
corporate expenses, manufacturing costs not included in standard costs, income taxes, and various nonrecurring charges. Corporate expenses include research and development, corporate marketing
expenses, and other separately managed general and administrative expenses including certain corporate expenses associated with support of the Retail segment. The Company does not include intercompany
transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. Segment assets exclude corporate assets. Corporate assets include cash, short-term and long-term investments,
manufacturing facilities, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets, and retail store construction-in-progress that is not subject
to depreciation. Except for the Retail segment, capital expenditures for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment. Capital expenditures by the Retail segment were
$92 million, $106 million, and $92 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. 


Operating
income for all segments except Retail includes cost of sales at standard cost. Certain manufacturing expenses and related adjustments not included in segment cost of sales, including
variances between standard and actual manufacturing costs and the mark-up above standard cost for product supplied to the Retail segment, are included in corporate expenses. 


To
assess the operating performance of the Retail segment several significant items are included in its results for internal management reporting that are not included in results of the Company's
other segments. First, cost of sales for the Retail segment includes a mark-up above the Company's standard cost to approximate the price normally charged to the Company's major channel
partners in the United States. For the years ended September 27, 2003, September 28, 2002, and September 29, 2001 this resulted in the 


95






 




recognition
of additional cost of sales above standard cost by the Retail segment and an offsetting benefit to corporate expenses of approximately $106 million, $52 million, and
$4 million, respectively. 


Second,
the Retail segment includes in its net sales proceeds from sales of the Company's extended warranty and support contracts and also recognizes related cost of sales based on the amount at which
such contracts are normally sold to the Company's resellers operating retail stores in the United States. This treatment is consistent with how the Company's major resellers account for the sales and
cost of the Company's extended warranty and support contracts. Because the Company has not yet earned the revenue or incurred the costs associated with the sale of these contracts, an offset to these
amounts is recognized in the Americas segment's net sales and cost of sales. For the year ended September 27, 2003, this resulted in the recognition of net sales and cost of sales by the Retail
segment, with
corresponding offsets in the Americas segment, of $30 million and $20 million, respectively. For the year ended September 28, 2002, this resulted in the recognition of net sales
and cost of sales by the Retail segment, with corresponding offsets in the Americas segment, of $8 million and $6 million, respectively. These amounts were insignificant in fiscal 2001. 


Third,
a portion of the operating expenses associated with certain high profile retail stores are allocated from the Retail segment to corporate marketing expense. Allocation of these expenses
reflects the unique nature of these stores which, given their larger size and extraordinary design elements, function as vehicles for general corporate marketing, corporate sales and marketing events,
and brand awareness. Allocated operating costs are those in excess of operating costs incurred by one of the Company's more typical retail locations. Stores were open in three such high profile
locations in New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago as of September 27, 2003. Expenses allocated to corporate marketing resulting from the operations of these three stores were $6 million
and $1 million in fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively.

A
large portion of the Company's net sales is derived from its international operations. Also, a majority of the raw materials used in the Company's products is obtained from sources outside of the
United States, and a majority of the products sold by the Company is assembled internationally in the Company's facility in Cork, Ireland or by third-party vendors in Taiwan, Korea, the Netherlands,
the People's Republic of China, and the Czech Republic. As a result, the Company is subject to risks associated with foreign operations, such as obtaining governmental permits and approvals, currency
exchange fluctuations, currency restrictions, political instability, labor problems, trade restrictions, and changes in tariff and freight charges. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of
net sales in 2003, 2002 or 2001.

Note 12Related Party Transactions and Certain Other Transactions  


During
the first quarter of 2000, the Company's Board of Directors approved a special executive bonus for the Company's Chief Executive Officer for past services in the form of an aircraft with a
total cost to the Company of approximately $90 million, the majority of which was not tax deductible. Approximately half of the total charge was for the cost of the aircraft. The other half
represented all other costs and taxes associated with the bonus. In the fourth quarter of 2002, all significant work and payments associated with the aircraft were completed. Of the original
$90 million accrual, $2.4 million remained unspent at the end of fiscal 2002 and was reversed. 


In
March 2002, the Company entered into a Reimbursement Agreement with its Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Steven P. Jobs, for the reimbursement of expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs in
the operation of his private plane when used for Apple business. The Reimbursement Agreement is effective for expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs for Apple business purposes since he took delivery of
the plane in May 2001. The Company recognized a total of $404,000 in expenses pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement during fiscal 2003. For fiscal 2002, the Company recognized a total of
$1,168,000 in expenses pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement related to expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs during 2001 and 2002. All expenses recognized pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement
have been included by the Company in selling, general, and administrative expenses. 


In
connection with a relocation assistance package, the Company loaned Mr. Ronald B. Johnson, Senior Vice President, Retail, $1.5 million for the purchase of his principal residence. The
loan is secured by a deed of trust and is due and payable in May 2004. Under the terms of the loan, Mr. Johnson agreed that should he exercise any of his stock options prior to the due
date of the loan, he would pay the Company an amount equal to the lesser of (1) an amount equal to 50% of the total net gain realized from the exercise 


99






 




of
the options; or (2) $375,000 multiplied by the number of years between the exercise date and the date of the loan. Mr. Johnson repaid $750,000 of this loan in fiscal 2003. The
remaining $750,000 is due and payable in May 2004. 


Mr. Jerome
York, a member of the Board of Directors of the Company, is a member of an investment group that purchased MicroWarehouse, Inc. (MicroWarehouse) in January 2000. Until
September 7, 2003, he also served as its Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. MicroWarehouse is a reseller of computer hardware, software and peripheral products, including products
made by the Company. On September 8, 2003, CDW Corporation (CDW), acquired selected North American assets of MicroWarehouse. MicroWarehouse subsequently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection in the
United States. MicroWarehouse accounted for 2.4%, 3.3%, and 2.9% of the Company's net sales in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Trade receivables from MicroWarehouse were $9.9 million
and $20.9 million as of September 27, 2003, and September 28, 2002, respectively. The Company has provided what it believes to be an adequate allowance on the outstanding
receivable based on the Company's secured interest position in selected MicroWarehouse assets and the expected payments to unsecured creditors. Sales to MicroWarehouse and related trade receivables
were generally subject to the same terms and conditions as those with the Company's other resellers. In addition, the Company purchases miscellaneous equipment and supplies from MicroWarehouse. Total
purchases amounted to approximately $2.3 million, $2.9 million, and $3.4 million in fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS    
 


The
Board of Directors and Shareholders

Apple Computer, Inc.: 


We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Computer, Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 27, 2003. These consolidated financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. 


We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 


In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Apple Computer, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 27,
2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 


As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for asset retirement obligations and for financial instruments with characteristics
of both liabilities and equity in 2003, changed its method of accounting for goodwill in 2002, and changed its method of accounting for hedging activities in 2001.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
 


Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  


Apple
Computer, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) designs, manufactures, and markets personal computers and related personal computing and communicating solutions for sale primarily to
education, creative, consumer, and business customers. 


Basis of Presentation and Preparation  


The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these
consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 


Typically,
the Company's fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of September. Fiscal years 2002 and 2001 were each 52-week years. However, approximately every six years, the Company reports
a 53-week fiscal year to align its fiscal quarters with calendar quarters by adding a week to its first fiscal quarter. Consequently, an additional week was added to the first quarter of
fiscal 2000. All information presented herein is based on the Company's fiscal calendar. 


Financial Instruments  


Investments  


The Company places its short-term investments in highly liquid securities issued by high credit quality issuers. All highly liquid investments with maturities of
three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents; highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as short-term
investments. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments in debt and marketable equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each
balance sheet date. The Company's marketable debt and equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. These securities are carried at fair
value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of shareholders' equity. The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method. 


Derivative Financial Instruments  


On October 1, 2000, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, 
Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities
. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, hedging activities, and exposure definition. SFAS
No. 133 requires that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income. If the
derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through
earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Net of the related income tax effect of approximately $5 million, adoption of SFAS
No. 133 resulted in a favorable cumulative-effect-type adjustment to net income of approximately $12 million. Net of the related income tax effect of approximately
$5 million, adoption of SFAS No. 133 resulted in a favorable cumulative-effect-type adjustment to other comprehensive income of approximately $12 million, all of which
was reclassified to earnings during 2001. Management does not believe that ongoing application of SFAS No. 133 will significantly alter the Company's hedging strategies. However, its
application may increase the volatility of other income and expense and other comprehensive income. 


For
derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are attributable to a particular risk and that are designated as cash flow hedges, the net gain or
loss on the 


53






 



derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction
affects earnings. To receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. For derivative
instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability or an identified portion thereof that are attributable to a particular risk and that are designated as fair
value hedges, the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current
period. The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure of the net investment in a foreign
operation is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For forward contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to
changes in the forward carry
component from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this component are recognized in current earnings. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging
instruments, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in the current period. 


For
foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges, hedge effectiveness is measured based on changes in the fair value of the contract attributable to changes in the forward
exchange rate. Changes in the expected future cash flows on the forecasted hedged transaction and changes in the fair value of the forward hedge are both measured from the contract rate to the forward
exchange rate associated with the forward contract's maturity date. For currency option contracts designated as cash flow hedges, hedge effectiveness is measured based on changes in total fair value
of the option contract. Hedge effectiveness is assessed by comparing the present value of the cumulative change in expected cash flows on the hedged transactions determined as the sum of the
probability-weighted outcomes with respect to the option strike rates with the total change in fair value of the option hedge. For interest rate swap agreements qualifying as fair value hedges, the
Company assumes no ineffectiveness because these swaps meet the criteria for accounting under the short-cut method defined in SFAS No. 133. 


Inventories  


Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. If the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are
made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. 


Property, Plant, and Equipment  


Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use of the declining balance and straight-line methods over the estimated useful
lives of the assets, which are 30 years for buildings, from 2 to 5 years for equipment, and the shorter of lease terms or estimated useful lives for leasehold improvements. The Company
capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related to internal-use
software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 5 years. 


Prior
to the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company had classified capitalized costs related to internal-use software on the balance sheet in other assets. Effective as of
September 29, 2001, and for all other periods presented, the Company has reclassified internal-use software to property, plant, and equipment and reclassified related cash flows for
the purchase or development of internal-use software from cash flow from operations to cash flow from investing activities. 


54






 


Non-Current Debt and Equity Investments  


Investments categorized as non-current debt and equity investments on the consolidated balance sheet are in equity and debt instruments of public companies. They
are not categorized as current assets either because, given their nature, they are not readily convertible into cash or because they represent potentially longer-term investments by the
Company. Further, the fair value of these investments has been subject to a high degree of volatility. The Company's non-current debt and equity investments have been categorized as
available-for-sale requiring that they be carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in equity as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income. However, the Company recognizes an impairment charge to earnings in the event a decline in fair value below the cost basis of one of these investments is determined to be
other-than-temporary. The Company includes recognized gains and losses resulting from the sale or from other-than-temporary declines in fair value
associated with these investments in other income and expense. Occasionally, the Company uses short-term equity derivatives to manage potential dispositions of non-current debt
and equity investments. Any gains or losses associated with such derivatives are recognized currently in other income and expense. 


Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets  


The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to
generate. If property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the
assets exceeds its fair market value. For the three years ended September 28, 2002, the Company has made no material adjustments to its long-lived assets except those made in
connection with the restructuring actions described in Note 5. 


The
Company adopted SFAS No. 142, 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
, in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. SFAS No. 142 requires that
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that they may be impaired. Prior to fiscal 2002, goodwill was amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life. The Company completed its transitional and
annual goodwill impairment tests as of October 1, 2001, and August 30, 2002, respectively, and found no impairment. The Company established reporting units based on its current reporting
structure. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit. 


SFAS
No. 142 also requires that intangible assets with definite lives be amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, 
 
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of
. The Company is currently
amortizing its acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods ranging from 3 to 7 years. 


Foreign Currency Translation  


The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its international non-U.S. functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at
the end of each period. Revenues and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are
credited or charged to "accumulated translation adjustment" included in "accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" in shareholders' equity. The Company's foreign manufacturing subsidiaries and
certain other international subsidiaries that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at year-end exchange 


55






 



rates, and inventories, property, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. Gains and losses from these translations are included in the Company's results of operations. 


Revenue Recognition  


Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of products (hardware, software, and peripherals), consulting and implementation services, and extended warranty and
support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards, including Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97-2, 
Software
Revenue Recognition
, as amended. Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and
collectibility is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped, and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For online sales to individuals, for some sales
to education customers in the United States, and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until product is received by the customer because the Company legally retains a portion of the risk
of loss on these sales during transit. For other product sales, these criteria are met by the Company at the time product is shipped. The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated
commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end user rebates and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. 


Revenue
for consulting and implementation services is recognized upon performance and acceptance by the customer. Revenue from extended warranty and support contracts is recognized ratably over the
contract period. Amounts billed to customers in excess of revenue recognized on extended warranty and support contracts are recognized as deferred revenue until revenue recognition criteria are met. 


Revenue
on arrangements that include multiple elements such as hardware, software, and services is allocated to each element based on vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of each
element. Allocated revenue for each element is recognized when revenue recognition criteria have been met for each element. Vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is generally determined
based on the price charged when each element is sold separately. 


Shipping Costs  


The Company's shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales for all periods presented. 


Warranty Expense  


The Company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred under product warranties at the time related revenue is recognized. 


Research and Development  


Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning
when a product's technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. In most instances, the Company's products are released soon
after technological feasibility has been established. Therefore, costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally all software
development costs have been expensed. 


During
the third and fourth quarter of 2002, the Company incurred substantial development costs associated with the development of Mac OS X version 10.2 (code-named "Jaguar") subsequent to
achievement of technological feasibility as evidenced by public demonstration and release of a developer beta in May 2002 and prior to release of the final version of the product in the fourth
quarter. As such, the Company capitalized approximately $13.3 million of development costs associated with development of 


56






 



Jaguar. Amortization of this asset began in the fourth quarter when Jaguar was shipped and is being recognized on a straight-line basis over 3 years. In addition, during 2002, the
Company also began capitalizing certain costs related to development of its new PowerSchool enterprise student information system. Capitalization, which began upon achievement of technological
feasibility in the first quarter, amounted to approximately $6 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2002. The final version of the enterprise student information system was released
in July. 


During
2001 the Company incurred substantial development costs associated with the development of the original version of Mac OS X, subsequent to release of a public beta version of the product and
prior to release of the final product version. As a result, the Company capitalized approximately $5.4 million of development costs during 2001 associated with development of Mac OS X. Related
amortization is computed by use of the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset of 8 years. 


Total
amortization related to capitalized software development costs was $1.2 million and $350,000 in 2002 and 2001, respectively. 


Advertising Costs  


Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $209 million, $261 million, and $281 million for 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. 


Stock-Based Compensation  


The Company measures compensation expense for its employee stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB)
Opinion 25, 
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
 and has provided pro forma disclosures of the effect on net income and earnings per share as if the
fair value-based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense. The Company has elected to follow APB No. 25 because, as discussed below, the alternative fair value accounting
provided for under SFAS No. 123, 
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
, requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use
in valuing employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares. Under APB Opinion No. 25, when the exercise price of the Company's employee stock options equals the market price of
the underlying stock on the date of the grant, no compensation expense is recognized. 


Pro
forma information regarding net income (loss) per share is required by SFAS No. 123 and has been determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock options granted and
employee stock purchase plan purchases subsequent to September 29, 1995, under the fair value method of that statement. The fair values for these options and stock purchases were estimated at
the date of grant and beginning of the period, respectively, using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options and shares are
amortized to pro forma net income over the options' vesting period and the shares' plan period. 


The
Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option
valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected life of options and the Company's expected stock price volatility. Because the Company's employee stock
options and employee stock purchase plan shares have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect
the fair value estimate, in management's opinion, the existing models do not provide a reliable measure of the fair value of the Company's employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan
shares. 


57






 


For
purposes of the pro forma disclosures pursuant to SFAS No. 123 provided in the Company's annual reports through 2002, the expected volatility assumptions used by the Company have been based
solely on historical volatility rates of the Company's common stock. The Company has made no adjustments to its expected volatility assumptions based on current market conditions, current market
trends, or expected volatility implicit in market traded options on the Company's stock. The Company will continue to monitor the propriety of this approach to developing its expected volatility
assumption and could determine for future periods that adjustments to historical volatility and/or use of a methodology that is based on the expected volatility implicit in market traded options on
the Company's common stock are more appropriate based on the facts and circumstances existing in future periods. 


Earnings Per Common Share  


Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period
increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of common stock had been issued. The dilutive effect of
outstanding options is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The dilutive effect of convertible securities is reflected using the
if-converted method. Dilutive potential shares of common stock related to stock options were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per common share for fiscal 2001 because their
effect would have been antidilutive. 


Stock Split  


On June 21, 2000, the Company affected a two-for-one stock split in the form of a Common Stock dividend to shareholders of record as of
May 19, 2000. All per share data and numbers of Common shares have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. 


Comprehensive Income  


Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under
generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders' equity but are excluded from net income. The Company's other comprehensive income is comprised of foreign currency
translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, from unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as
available-for-sale, and from net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges. 


Segment Information  


The Company reports segment information based on the "management" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions
and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments. Information about the Company's products, major customers, and geographic areas on a company-wide basis is
also disclosed. 


Note 2Financial Instruments  


The
carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate their fair value due to the short maturities of those instruments.

The
Company's U.S. corporate securities include commercial paper, loan participations, certificates of deposit, time deposits and corporate debt securities. Foreign securities include foreign
commercial paper, loan participation, certificates of deposit and time deposits with foreign institutions, most of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. Net unrealized gains on the Company's
investment portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities greater than 1 year, were $20 million as of September 28, 2002 and $11 million as of
September 29, 2001. The Company occasionally sells short-term investments prior to their stated maturities. As a result of such sales, the Company recognized net gains of
$7 million in 2002 and $1 million in 2001. These net gains were included in interest and other income, net. 


As
of September 28, 2002, approximately $1.087 billion of the Company's short-term investments had underlying maturities of between 1 and 5 years. The remaining
short-term investments as of September 28, 2002 all had maturities of between 3 and 12 months. As of September 29, 2001, approximately $313 million of the
Company's short-term investments in U.S. agency securities had underlying maturities of between 1 and 4 years. The remaining short-term investments as of
September 29, 2001, all had maturities of between 3 and 12 months. 


Accounts Receivable  


Trade Receivables  


The Company distributes its products through third-party computer resellers and directly to certain education and consumer customers. The Company generally does not require
collateral from its customers. However, when possible the Company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables through the use of flooring arrangements for selected customers with
third-party financing companies and credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America and Asia. However, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are
outstanding with the Company's distribution and retail channel partners. Trade receivables from a single customer, Ingram Micro, Inc., accounted for approximately 10.8% and 9.4% of net accounts
receivable as of September 28, 2002, and September 29, 2001, respectively.

Non-Trade Receivables  


The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale by the Company of raw material components to these
manufacturing vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these raw material components directly from suppliers. These
non-trade receivables, which are included in the consolidated balances sheets in other current assets, totaled $142 million and $68 million as of September 28, 2002,
and September 29, 2001, respectively. The Company does not recognize any profits on these sales or reflect the sale of these components in its net sales. 


Inventory Prepayment  


In April 2002, the Company made a $100 million prepayment to an Asian supplier for the purchase of components over the following nine months. In return for this
deposit, the supplier agreed to supply the Company with a specified level of components in the three consecutive fiscal quarters ending December 28, 2002. If the supplier fails to supply the
agreed upon level of components in any of those three fiscal quarters, the Company may cancel the arrangement and receive the amount of the prepayment not utilized plus a penalty. Approximately
$53 million of this deposit remained unused as of September 28, 2002, and is reflected in the condensed consolidated balance sheets in other current assets. The amount of the prepayment
not utilized by the Company on or before December 31, 2002, is refundable to the Company by January 31, 2003. 


Although
the supplier's existing debt is unrated, its public debt pricing is consistent with other BBB rated companies. The deposit is unsecured and has no stated interest component. The Company is
imputing an amount to cost of sales and interest income during each period the deposit is outstanding at an appropriate market interest rate to reflect the economics of this transaction. In light of
the supplier's implied debt rating and because the Company's prepayment is unsecured, non-performance by and/or economic deterioration of the supplier could place all or some of the
Company's deposit at risk. 


Derivative Financial Instruments  


The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. Foreign currency forward and option contracts are used to
offset the foreign exchange risk on certain existing assets and liabilities and to hedge the foreign exchange risk on expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenues and cost of sales. From
time to time, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate profile of certain investments and debt. The Company's accounting policies for these instruments are
based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.

The
notional principal amounts for derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of year-end, and do not represent the amount of the Company's
exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amount shown in the table above represents the Company's gross exposure to potential accounting loss on these transactions if all counterparties
failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency exchange and interest rates at each respective date. The Company's exposure to credit loss and
market risk will vary over time as a function of interest rates and currency exchange rates. 


The
estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models using prevailing financial market information as of September 28, 2002 and September 29, 2001. In
certain instances where judgment is required in estimating fair value, price quotes were obtained from several of the Company's counterparty financial institutions. Although the table above reflects
the notional principal,
fair value, and credit risk amounts of the Company's interest rate and foreign exchange instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the
interest rate and foreign exchange instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the
underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. 


Foreign Exchange Risk Management  


The Company enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions primarily to protect against foreign exchange risk associated with existing
assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions and certain probable but not firmly committed transactions. Generally, the Company's practice is to hedge a majority of its existing
material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular
exposures, or availability of appropriate hedging instruments. 


61






 


In
accordance with SFAS No. 133, hedges related to probable but not firmly committed transactions of an anticipatory nature are designated and documented at hedge inception as cash flow hedges
and evaluated for hedge effectiveness quarterly. For currency forward contracts, hedge effectiveness is measured based on changes in the total fair value of the contract attributable to changes in the
forward exchange rate. Changes in the expected future cash flows on the forecasted hedged transaction and changes in the fair value of the forward hedge are both measured from the contract rate to the
forward exchange rate associated with the forward contract's maturity date. 


For
currency option contracts, hedge effectiveness is measured based on changes in the total fair value of the option contract. Hedge effectiveness is assessed by comparing the present value of the
cumulative change in expected future cash flows on the hedged transaction determined as the sum of the probability-weighted outcomes with respect to the option strike rates with the total change in
fair value of the option hedge. The net gains or losses on derivative instruments qualifying as cash flow hedges are reported as components of other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity and
reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any residual changes in fair value of these instruments are recognized in current
earnings in other income and expense. 


To
protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company's U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenues, and the
Company's non-U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries selling in local currencies hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries' functional currency.
Other comprehensive income associated with hedges of foreign currency revenues is recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related sales are recognized, and other comprehensive
income related to inventory purchases is recognized as a component of cost of sales in
the same period as the related costs are recognized. Typically, the Company hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenues and inventory purchases over a time
horizon of 3 to 9 months. 


The
Company also enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain recorded assets and
liabilities in non-functional currencies. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in current earnings in other income and expense as offsets to the changes in the
fair value of the related assets or liabilities. 


The
Company may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to offset the translation and economic exposure of a net investment position in a foreign subsidiary. Hedge effectiveness on forwards
designated as net investment hedges is measured based on changes in the fair value of the contract attributable to changes in the spot exchange rate. The effective portion of the net gain or loss on a
derivative instrument designated as a hedge of the net investment position in a foreign subsidiary is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. Any residual changes in
fair value of the forward contract, including changes in fair value based on the differential between the spot and forward exchange rates are recognized in current earnings in other income and
expense. 


As
discussed above, the Company enters into foreign currency option contracts as items that provide an offset to the re-measurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities denominated
in non-functional currencies. All changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts based on changes in option time value are recorded in current earnings in other income and
expense. Due to market movements, changes in option time value can lead to increased volatility in other income and expense. 


Derivative
instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable that the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified
time period or within a 


62






 





subsequent 2 month time period. Deferred gains and losses in other comprehensive income associated with such derivative instruments are immediately reclassified into earnings in other income
and expense. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are also reflected in current earnings unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions.
During 2002, the Company recorded net gains of $2.5 million in other income and expense related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges due to changes in the Company's
forecast of future net sales and cost of sales and due to prevailing market conditions. During 2001, the Company recorded a net gain of $5.1 million in other income and expense related to the
loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges due to changes in the Company's forecast of future net sales and cost of sales. 


Interest Rate Risk Management  


The Company sometimes enters into interest rate derivative transactions, including interest rate swaps, collars, and floors, with financial institutions in order to better
match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on its
long-term debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the Company's exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. The Company may also enter into interest rate
contracts that are intended to reduce the cost of the interest rate risk management program. The Company does not hold or transact in such financial instruments for purposes other than risk
management. 


As
of September 30, 2000, the Company had entered into interest rate swaps with financial institutions in order to better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its
cash equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on its long-term debt, and to diversify a portion of the Company's exposure away
from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. The interest rate swaps generally required the Company to pay a floating interest rate based on the three- or six-month
U.S. dollar LIBOR and receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of the underlying notional amounts. These swaps effectively converted the Company's fixed-rate 10-year
debt to floating-rate debt and converted a portion of the floating rate investments to fixed rate. The Company assumed no ineffectiveness with regard to the debt interest swaps as each
debt interest rate swap met the criteria for accounting under the short-cut method defined in SFAS No. 133 for fair value hedges of debt instruments. Accordingly, no net gains or
losses were recorded in income relative to the Company's underlying debt interest rate swaps. During fiscal 2001, the Company closed out all of its existing debt interest rate swap positions due to
prevailing market interest rates realizing a gain of $17 million. This gain was deferred, recognized in long-term debt and is being amortized to other income and expense over the
remaining life of the debt. 


The
unrealized loss on the assets swaps as of September 30, 2000, of $5.7 million was deferred and then recognized in income in 2001 as part of the SFAS No. 133 transition
adjustment effective on October 1, 2000. The Company closed out all of its existing interest rate asset swaps during 2001 realizing a gain of $1.1 million. 


As
of September 28, 2002, the Company had no interest rate derivatives outstanding. Due to perceived market risk, the Company entered into interest rate swaps in early 2002. These interest rate
swaps were entered into with financial institutions in order to better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with
its fixed-rate interest expense on its long-term debt. The interest rate swaps required the Company to pay a floating interest rate based on six-month U.S. dollar
LIBOR and receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of the underlying notional amounts. These swaps effectively converted the Company's fixed-rate 10-year debt to
floating-rate debt. The Company assumed no ineffectiveness with regard to the debt interest swaps as each debt interest rate swap met the criteria for accounting under the
short-cut method defined in SFAS No. 133 for fair 


63






 





value hedges of debt instruments. Accordingly, no net gains or losses were recorded in income relative to the Company's underlying debt interest rate swaps during fiscal 2002 until the Company closed
out the positions in late 2002 due to prevailing market interest rates. Closing the debt interest rate swaps resulted in a realized gain of $6 million. This gain was deferred, recognized in
long-term debt and is being amortized to other income and expense over the remaining life of the debt. 


Long-Term Debt  


During 1994, the Company issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 6.5% unsecured notes in a public offering registered with the SEC. The notes were sold at
99.925% of par, for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. The notes pay interest semiannually and mature on February 15, 2004. As of September 28, 2002 and September 29, 2001,
the carrying amount of these notes, including unamortized deferred gains associated with closed debt interest rate swaps, was $316 million and $317 million, respectively, while the fair
value was $299 million and $295 million, respectively. The fair value of the notes is based on their listed market values as of September 28, 2002 and September 29, 2001. 


Non-Current Debt and Equity Investments and Related Gains and Losses  


The Company has held significant investments in EarthLink Network, Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai), ARM Holdings plc (ARM), and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd
(Samsung). These investments have been reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as non-current debt and equity investments, and their combined fair value was $39 million and
$128 million as of September 28, 2002, and September 29, 2001, respectively. 


EarthLink  


In January 2000, the Company invested $200 million in EarthLink, an Internet service provider (ISP). The investment is in EarthLink's Series C Convertible
Preferred Stock, which is convertible by the Company after January 4, 2001, into approximately 7.1 million shares of EarthLink common stock. Concurrent with this investment, EarthLink
and the Company entered into a multi-year agreement to deliver ISP service to Macintosh users in the United States. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company profits from each new Mac
customer that subscribes to EarthLink's ISP service for a specified period of time, and EarthLink is the default ISP in the Company's Internet Setup Software included with all Macintosh computers sold
in the United States. 


During
the second quarter of 2001, the Company determined that the then current decline in the fair value of its investment in EarthLink was other-than-temporary requiring that its cost basis be
written down to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write-down be included in earnings. As a result, the Company recognized a $114 million charge to earnings to
write-down the basis of its investment in EarthLink to $86 million. This charge was included in gains (losses) on non-current investments, net. During the fourth quarter
of 2001, the Company sold a total of approximately 425,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds of approximately $6 million and recorded a gain before taxes of approximately $800,000. As
of September 29, 2001, the Company held 6.7 million shares of EarthLink stock with a fair value of approximately $102 million. 


During
the first quarter of 2002, the Company sold 117,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds of $2 million and a gain before taxes of $223,000. No sales of EarthLink were made in any
of the subsequent quarters of fiscal 2002. However, during the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company determined that the then
current decline in the fair value of its investment in EarthLink was other-than-temporary. As a result, the Company recognized a $44 million charge to earnings to write-down the
basis of its investment in 


64






 





EarthLink to $35 million. This charge was included in gains (losses) on non-current investments, net. As of September 28, 2002, the Company holds 6.5 million shares
of EarthLink stock valued at $35 million. 


Akamai  


In June 1999, the Company invested $12.5 million in Akamai, a global Internet content delivery service. The investment was in the form of convertible preferred
stock that converted into 4.1 million shares of Akamai common stock (adjusted for subsequent stock splits) at the time of Akamai's initial public offering in October 1999. Beginning in
the first quarter of 2000, the Company categorized its shares in Akamai as available-for-sale. The fair value of the Company's investment in Akamai was approximately
$216 million as of September 30, 2000. During 2001, the Company sold a total of approximately 1 million shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of approximately $39 million
and recorded a gain before taxes of approximately $36 million. As of September 29, 2001, the Company held 3.1 million shares of Akamai stock valued at $9 million. 


During
the first quarter of 2002, the Company sold 250,000 shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of $2 million and a gain before taxes of $710,000. No sales of Akamai were made in any of the
subsequent quarters of fiscal 2002. However, during the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company determined that the decline in the fair value of its investment in Akamai was other-than-temporary. As a
result, the Company recognized a $6 million charge to earnings to write-down the basis of its investment in Akamai to $3 million. This charge was included in gains (losses)
on non-current investments, net. As of September 28, 2002, the Company holds 2.9 million shares of Akamai stock valued at $3 million. 


ARM Holdings  


ARM is a publicly held company in the United Kingdom involved in the design and licensing of high performance microprocessors and related technology. During the first quarter
of 2002, the Company sold 4.7 million shares of ARM stock for both net proceeds and a gain before taxes of $21 million. No sales of ARM were made in any of the subsequent quarters of
fiscal 2002. As of September 28, 2002, the Company holds 278,000 shares of ARM stock valued at $578,000. 


During
2001, the Company sold a total of approximately 29.8 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of approximately $176 million and recorded a gain before taxes of approximately
$174 million. As of September 29, 2001, the Company held 5 million shares of ARM stock valued at $17 million. During 2000, the Company sold a total of approximately
45.2 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of approximately $372 million and recorded a gain before taxes of approximately $367 million. 


Samsung  


During the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company invested $100 million in Samsung to assist in the further expansion of Samsung's TFT-LCD
flat-panel display production capacity. The investment was in the form of three year unsecured bonds, which were convertible into approximately 550,000 shares of Samsung common stock
beginning in July 2000. The bonds carried an annual coupon rate of 2% and pay a total yield to maturity of 5% if redeemed at their maturity. The fair value of the Company's investment in
Samsung was approximately $123 million as of September 30, 2000. 


Prior
to its sale, the Company had categorized its investment in Samsung as available-for-sale requiring that it be carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net
of taxes, reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The fair value of the Company's investment in Samsung was approximately $123 million as of
September 30, 2000. With the adoption of SFAS No. 133 on October 1, 2000, the Company was required to account for the conversion option embedded in the 


65






 





Samsung bonds separately from the related debt. The conversion feature was carried at fair value with any changes in fair value recognized in earnings in the period in which they occur. Included in
the $17 million gross SFAS No. 133 transition adjustment recorded in earnings during the first quarter of fiscal 2001 was a $23 million favorable adjustment for the restatement to
fair value as of October 1, 2000, of the derivative component of the Company's investment in Samsung. To adjust the carrying value of the derivative component of its investment in Samsung to
fair value as of December 30, 2000, the Company recognized an unrealized loss of approximately $13 million during the first quarter of 2001. During the second quarter of 2001, the
Company sold this investment for book value, including accrued interest, and received net proceeds of approximately $117 million. 


Other Strategic Investments  


The Company has made additional minority debt and equity investments in several privately held technology companies which were reflected in the consolidated balance sheets in
other assets. These investments are inherently risky because the products and/or markets of these companies are typically not fully developed. During 2001 the Company determined that the decline in
fair value of certain of these investments was other-than-temporary and, accordingly, recognized a charge to earnings of approximately $8 million. This charge was included in gains (losses) on
non-current investments, net. During 2002, the Company determined that the decline in fair value of certain of these investments was other-than-temporary and, accordingly, recognized a
charge to earnings of $15 million. These charges were included in gains (losses) on non-current investments, net. As of September 28, 2002, the Company has no private debt or
equity investments reflected in its consolidated balance sheet.

Acquisition of Emagic  


During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company acquired Emagic GmbH, a provider of professional software solutions for computer based music production, for approximately
$30 million in cash; $26 million of which was paid immediately upon closing of the deal and $4 million of which was held-back for future payment contingent on
continued employment by certain employees that will be allocated to future compensation expense in the appropriate periods over the next 3 years. The acquisition has been accounted for as a
purchase. The portion of the purchase price allocated to purchased in-process research and development (IPR&D) was expensed immediately, and the portion of the purchase price allocated to 


68






 



acquired technology and to tradename will be amortized over their estimated useful lives of 3 years. Total consideration was allocated as follows (in millions):

The
amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition, because the technological feasibility of products under development had not been established and no alternative
future uses existed. The IPR&D relates primarily to Emagic's Logic series technology and extensions. At the date of the acquisition, the products under development were between 43%-83%
complete, and it was expected that the remaining work would be completed during the Company's fiscal 2003 at a cost of approximately $415,000. The remaining efforts include finalizing user interface
design and development, and testing. The fair value of the IPR&D was determined by an independent third-party valuation using the income approach, which reflects the projected free cash flows that
will be generated by the IPR&D projects and that are attributable to the acquired technology, and discounting the projected net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 25%. 


Acquisition of certain assets of Zayante, Inc., Prismo Graphics, and Silicon Grail  


During fiscal 2002 the Company acquired certain technology and patent rights of Zayante, Inc., Prismo Graphics, and Silicon Grail Corporation for a total of
$20 million in cash. These transactions have been accounted for as asset acquisitions. The purchase price for these asset acquisitions, except for $1 million identified as contingent
consideration which will be allocated to compensation expense over the next 3 years, has been allocated to acquired technology and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over
3 years, except for certain assets acquired from Zayante associated with patent royalty streams that will be amortized over 10 years. 


Acquisition of Nothing Real, LLC  


During the second quarter of 2002, the Company acquired certain assets of Nothing Real, LLC (Nothing Real), a privately-held company that develops and markets high
performance tools designed for the digital image creation market. Of the $15 million purchase price, the Company has allocated $7 million to acquired technology, which will be amortized
over its estimated life of 5 years. The remaining $8 million, which has been identified as contingent consideration, rather than recorded as an
additional component of the cost of the acquired assets, will be allocated to future compensation expense in the appropriate periods over the next 3 years. 


Acquisition of Spruce Technologies, Inc.  


In July 2001, the Company acquired Spruce Technologies, Inc. (Spruce), a privately-held company that develops and markets DVD authoring products, for
$14.9 million in cash. Goodwill associated with the acquisition of Spruce is not subject to amortization pursuant to the transition provisions of SFAS No. 142.

Acquisition of PowerSchool, Inc.  


In May 2001, the Company acquired PowerSchool, Inc. (PowerSchool), a provider of web-based student information systems for K-12 schools
and districts that enables schools to record, access, report, and manage their student data and performance in real-time, and gives parents real-time web access to track their
children's progress. The consolidated financial statements include the operating results of PowerSchool from the date of acquisition. 


The
purchase price of approximately $66.1 million consisted of the issuance of approximately 2.4 million shares of the Company's common stock with a fair value of $61.2 million,
the issuance of stock options with a fair value of $4.5 million, and $300,000 of direct transaction costs. The fair value of the common stock options issued was determined using a Black-Scholes
option pricing model with the following
assumptions: volatility of 67%, expected life of 4 years, dividend rate of 0%, and risk-free rate of 4.73%. Total consideration was allocated as follows (in millions):

The
amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition, because the technological feasibility of products under development had not been established and no alternative
future uses existed. The IPR&D relates to technologies representing processes and expertise employed to design, develop, and deploy a functioning, scalable web-based student information
system for use by K-12 schools. At the date of the acquisition, the product under development was approximately 50% complete, and it was expected that the remaining 50% would be completed
during the Company's fiscal 2002 at a cost of approximately $9.25 million. The remaining efforts, which were completed in 2002, included completion of coding, finalizing user interface design
and development, and testing. The fair value of the IPR&D was determined by an independent third-party valuation using the income approach, which reflects the projected free cash flows that will be
generated by the IPR&D projects and that are attributable to the acquired technology, and discounting the projected net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 25%. The
acquired intangibles are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of three years, respectively. Deferred stock compensation associated with restricted stock and options is being amortized
over the required future vesting period of three years.

In
the fourth quarter of 2001, an adjustment was made to increase goodwill associated with the acquisition of PowerSchool by $5.9 million due to the identification of previously unidentified
loss contingencies that were in existence prior to consummation of the acquisition. 


Acquisition-Related Deferred Stock Compensation  


The Company allocated $12.8 million of its purchase consideration for PowerSchool to acquisition-related deferred stock compensation within shareholders' equity. This
amount represents the intrinsic value of stock options assumed that vest as future services are provided by employees and related to 445,000 common shares issued contingent on continued employment of
certain PowerSchool employee stockholders. 


Pro Forma Financial Information  


The unaudited pro forma financial information below presents the condensed consolidated financial results of the Company assuming that PowerSchool and Spruce, acquired in 2001,
had been acquired at the beginning of 2000 and includes the effect of amortization of goodwill and other acquired identifiable intangible assets from that date. The impact of the charge for IPR&D
associated with the acquisition of PowerSchool has been excluded. This pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of
future operations that would have been achieved had the acquisitions taken place at the beginning of 2000. Pro forma information follows (in millions, except per share amounts):

Note 5Special Charges  


Restructuring Actions  


2002 Restructuring Actions  


During fiscal 2002, the Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $30 million related to actions intended to eliminate certain activities and better
align the Company's operating expenses with existing general economic conditions and to partially offset the cost of continuing investments in new product development and investments in the Company's
Retail operating segment. 


During
the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of approximately $6 million designed to reduce headcount costs in
Corporate operations and sales and to adjust its PowerSchool product strategy. These restructuring actions resulted in the elimination of approximately 180 positions worldwide at a cost of
$1.8 million, 161 of which were eliminated by September 28, 2002. Eliminated positions were primarily in Corporate operations, sales, and PowerSchool related research and development.
The shift in product strategy at PowerSchool included discontinuing development and marketing of PowerSchool's PSE product. This shift resulted in the impairment of previously capitalized development
costs associated with the PSE product in the amount of $4.5 million. As of September 28, 2002, substantially all of the $6 million accrual had been utilized, except for
insignificant severance and related costs associated with the 19 remaining positions. 


71








 
 


During the first quarter of 2002, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of approximately $24 million. These
restructuring actions will result in the elimination of approximately 425 positions worldwide, 415 of which were eliminated by September 28, 2002, at a cost of $8 million. Positions were
eliminated primarily in the Company's operations, information systems, and administrative functions. In addition, these restructuring actions also included significant changes in the Company's
information systems strategy resulting in termination of equipment leases and cancellation of existing projects and activities. Related lease and contract cancellation charges totaled
$12 million, and charges for asset impairments totaled $4 million. Of the original $24 million restructuring charge made during the first quarter of 2002, approximately
$23 million had been spent as of September 28, 2002 and approximately $250,000 was reversed during the second quarter of 2002 due to lower actual costs than originally estimated for
certain lease commitments and severance benefits. The remaining $1 million accrual relates primarily to future payments on abandoned operating leases. 


2000 Restructuring Actions  


During the first quarter of 2000, the Company initiated restructuring actions resulting in recognition of an $8 million restructuring charge. This charge was comprised
of $3 million for the write-off of various operating assets and $5 million for severance payments to approximately 95 employees associated with consolidation of various
domestic and international sales and marketing functions. Of the $5 million accrued for severance, $2.5 million had been spent before the end of 2000, and the remainder was spent in
2001. Of the $3 million accrued for the write-off of various assets, substantially all was utilized before the end of 2000. 


Executive Bonus  


During the first quarter of 2000, the Company's Board of Directors approved a special executive bonus for the Company's Chief Executive Officer for past services in the form of
an aircraft with a total cost to the Company of approximately $90 million, the majority of which was not tax deductible. Approximately half of the total charge is for the cost of the aircraft.
The other half represents all other costs and taxes associated with the bonus. In the fourth quarter of 2002, all significant work and payments associated with the aircraft were complete. Of the
original $90 million accrual, $2.4 million remained unspent at the end of fiscal 2002 and was reversed. 


Technology Acquisition  


As discussed in Note 4, during both 2002 and 2001 in its acquisition of Emagic and PowerSchool, respectively, the Company acquired certain technology that was under
development and had no alternative future use. This resulted in the recognition of purchased in-process research and development in the amount of $551,000 for Emagic and
$10.8 million for PowerSchool, which was charged to operations upon acquisition.

The
foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pretax earnings of approximately $284 million, $363 million and $1.019 billion in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. As
of September 28, 2002, approximately half of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments is held by foreign subsidiaries and is generally based in U.S.
dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries would be subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the United States. The Company's consolidated financial statements fully
provide for any related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated, aside from undistributed earnings of certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be indefinitely
reinvested in operations outside the United States. U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $755 million of such earnings. It is not practicable to determine the
income tax liability that might be incurred if these earnings were to be distributed. 


Deferred
tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits, and the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts
of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected
to be recovered or settled.

As
of September 28, 2002, the Company had operating loss carryforwards for federal tax purposes of approximately $72 million, which expire from 2009 through 2021. These carryforwards are
comprised of remaining operating loss carryforwards acquired from NeXT and other acquisitions, the utilization of which is subject to certain limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The
Company also has Federal credit carryforwards and various state and foreign tax loss and credit carryforwards, the tax effect of which is approximately $94 million and which expire between 2003
and 2022. The remaining benefits
from tax losses and credits do not expire. As of September 28, 2002, a valuation allowance of $30 million was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax losses that
may not be realized. The valuation allowance relates primarily to the operating loss carryforwards acquired from NeXT and other acquisitions. Management believes it is more likely than not that
forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully
recover the remaining deferred tax assets.

The
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed audits of the Company's federal income tax returns through 1997. Substantially all IRS audit issues for years through 1997 have been resolved. The IRS
is currently auditing the Company's federal income tax returns for fiscal years 1998 through 2000. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from
tax examinations. 


Note 7Shareholders' Equity  


Stock Repurchase Plan  


In July 1999, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does
not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time. During 2000, the Company repurchased a total of 2.55 million shares of its
common stock at a cost of $116 million. During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company entered into a forward purchase agreement to acquire 1.5 million shares of its common stock in
September of 2003 at an average price of $16.64 per share for a total cost of $25.5 million. The Company engaged in no transactions relating to the stock repurchase plan in fiscal 2002. Since
inception of the repurchase plan, the Company has repurchased or committed to repurchase a total of 6.55 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $217 million. 


Preferred Stock  


In August 1997, the Company and Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft) entered into a patent cross license and technology agreements. In addition, Microsoft purchased 150,000
shares of Apple Series A nonvoting convertible preferred stock ("preferred stock") for $150 million. These shares were convertible by Microsoft after August 5, 2000, into shares
of the Company's common stock at a conversion price of $8.25 per share. During 2000, 74,250 shares of preferred stock were converted to 9 million shares of the
Company's common stock. During 2001, the remaining 75,750 preferred shares were converted into 9.2 million shares of the Company's common stock.

Note 8Employee Benefit Plans  


1998 Executive Officer Stock Plan  


The 1998 Executive Officer Stock Plan (the 1998 Plan) is a shareholder approved plan which replaced the 1990 Stock Option Plan terminated in April 1998, the 1981 Stock
Option Plan terminated in October 1990, and the 1987 Executive Long Term Stock Option Plan terminated in July 1995. Options granted before these plans' termination dates remain
outstanding in accordance with their terms. Options may be granted under the 1998 Plan to the Chairman of the Board of Directors, executive officers of the Company at the 


76






 



level of Senior Vice President and above, and other key employees. These options generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment, and generally expire
10 years after the grant date. The 1998 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, and stock purchase rights. 


1997 Employee Stock Option Plan  


In August 1997, the Company's Board of Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 1997 Plan), a non-shareholder approved plan for grants of
stock options to employees who are not officers of the Company. Options may be granted under the 1997 Plan to employees at not less than the fair market value on the date of grant. These options
generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment, and generally expire 10 years after the grant date. 


1997 Director Stock Option Plan  


In August 1997, the Company's Board of Directors adopted a shareholder approved Director Stock Option Plan (DSOP) for non-employee directors of the Company.
Initial grants of 30,000 options under the DSOP vest in three equal installments on each of the first through third anniversaries of the date of grant, and subsequent annual grants of 10,000 options
are fully vested at grant. Prior to adoption of the DSOP, 60,000 options were granted in total to two then-current members of the Company's Board of Directors. 


Employee Stock Purchase Plan  


The Company has a shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan (the Purchase Plan), under which substantially all employees may purchase common stock through payroll
deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values as of the beginning and end of six-month offering periods. Stock purchases under the Purchase Plan are limited to
10% of an employee's compensation, up to a maximum of $25,000 in any calendar year. During 2002, 2001, and 2000, 1.8 million, 1.8 million and 766,000 shares, respectively, were issued
under the Purchase Plan. As of September 28, 2002, approximately 2.1 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan. 


Employee Savings Plan  


The Company has an employee savings plan (the Savings Plan) qualifying as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the
Savings Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limit ($11,000 for calendar year 2002). The
Company matches 50% to 100% of each employee's contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employee's earnings. The Company's matching contributions to the Savings Plan
were approximately $19 million, $17 million, and $16 million in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.

Company had exercisable options to purchase 42.1 million shares outstanding as of September 29, 2001 with a weighted average exercise price of $32.15. As of September 30,
2000, the Company had exercisable options outstanding to purchase 23.7 million shares with a weighted average exercise price of $31.94. 


Note 9Stock-Based Compensation  


Pro
forma information regarding net income (loss) per share is required by SFAS No. 123 and has been determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock options granted and
employee stock purchase plan purchases subsequent to September 29, 1995, under the fair value method of that statement. The fair values for these options and stock purchases were estimated at
the date of grant and beginning of the period, respectively, using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The assumptions used for each of the last three fiscal years and the resulting estimate of
weighted-average fair value per share of options granted during those years are as follows:

Note 10Commitments and Contingencies  


Lease Commitments  


The Company leases various facilities and equipment under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The major facilities leases are for terms of 5 to 10 years and
generally provide renewal options for terms of 3 to 5 additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms of 5 to 12 years and often contain multi-year renewal options. Rent
expense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $92 million, $80 million, and $72 million in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. Future
minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of one year as of September 28, 2002, are as follows (in millions):

Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product  


Although certain components essential to the Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, other key components (including microprocessors and
application-specific integrated circuits, or ("ASICs")) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some other key components, while currently available to the Company from
multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide availability and pricing pressures. In addition, the Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer
industry, and new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for and
subsequently qualifies additional suppliers. If the supply of a key single-sourced component to the Company were to be delayed or curtailed or in the event a key manufacturing 


80






 



vendor delays shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company's ability to ship related products in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely affected. The Company's
business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient
quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of
components customized to meet the Company's requirements. Finally, significant portions of the Company's CPUs, logic boards, and assembled products are now manufactured by outsourcing partners, the
majority of which occurs in various parts of Asia. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules and levels, the Company's operating results could be
adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production obligations. 


Contingencies  


Beginning on September 27, 2001, three shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against
the Company and its Chief Executive Officer. These lawsuits are substantially identical, and purport to bring suit on behalf of persons who purchased the Company's publicly traded common stock between
July 19, 2000, and September 28, 2000. The complaints allege violations of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. The Company
believes these claims are without merit and intends to defend them vigorously. The Company filed a motion to dismiss on June 4, 2002, which was heard by the Court on September 13, 2002.
On December 11, 2002, the Court granted the Company's motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action, with leave to plaintiffs to amend their complaint within thirty days. 


The
Company is subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully adjudicated. In the opinion of management, the Company
does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.
However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved
against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. 


The
parliament of the European Union is working on finalizing the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (the Directive). The Directive makes producers of electrical goods, including
personal computers, financially responsible for the collection, recycling, and safe disposal of past and future products. The Directive must now be approved and implemented by individual European
Union governments by June 2004, while the producers' financial obligations are scheduled to start June 2005. The Company's potential liability resulting from the Directive related to
past sales of its products and expenses associated with future sales of its product may be substantial. However, because it is likely that specific laws, regulations, and enforcement policies will
vary significantly between individual European member states, it is not currently possible to estimate the Company's existing liability or future expenses resulting from the Directive. As the European
Union and its individual member states clarify specific requirements and policies with respect to the Directive, the Company will continue to assess its potential financial impact. Similar legislation
may be enacted in other geographies, including federal and state legislation in the United States, the cumulative impact of which could be significant.

Note 11Segment Information and Geographic Data  


The
Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas segment includes both North
and South America, except for the activities of the Company's Retail segment. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Japan segment includes only
Japan. The Retail segment operates Apple-owned retail stores in the United States. Other operating segments include Asia-Pacific, which includes Australia and Asia except for Japan, and
the Company's subsidiary, Filemaker, Inc. Each reportable geographic operating segment provides similar products and services, and the accounting policies of the various segments are the same
as those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1, except as described below for the Retail segment. 


The
Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are based on the location of the customers. Operating income
for each segment includes revenue from third-parties, cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense
and certain expenses that are managed outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses, manufacturing costs not included in standard
costs, income taxes, and various nonrecurring charges. Corporate expenses include research and development, corporate marketing expenses, and other separately managed general and administrative
expenses including certain corporate expenses associated with support of the Retail segment. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.
Segment assets exclude corporate assets. Corporate assets include cash, short-term and long-term investments, manufacturing facilities, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure,
goodwill and other acquired intangible assets, and retail store construction-in-progress which is not subject to depreciation. Except for the Retail segment, capital
expenditures for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment. Capital expenditures by the Retail segment were $106 million in 2002 and $92 million in 2001. 


Operating
income for all segments except Retail includes cost of sales at standard cost. Certain manufacturing expenses and related adjustments not included in segment cost of sales, including
variances between standard and actual manufacturing costs and the mark-up above standard cost for product supplied to the Retail segment, are included in corporate expenses. 


To
assess the operating performance of the Retail segment several significant items are included in its results for internal management reporting that are not included in results of the Company's
other segments. First, cost of sales for the Retail segment includes a mark-up above the Company's standard cost to approximate the price normally charged to the Company's major channel
partners in the United States. For the twelve-month period ended September 28, 2002 and September 29, 2001, this resulted in the recognition of additional cost of sales above standard
cost by the Retail segment and an offsetting benefit to corporate expenses of approximately $52 million and $4 million, respectively. Second, the Retail segment includes in its net sales
proceeds from sales of the Company's extended warranty and support contracts. This treatment is consistent with how the Company's major channel partners account for the sale of the Company's extended
warranty and support contracts. Because the revenue from these contracts has yet to be earned by the Company, an offset to this amount is reflected as a decrease in other segments' net sales. For the
twelve-month period ended September 28, 2002, this resulted in the recognition of additional net sales by the Retail segment, and an offsetting reduction to other segments' net sales of
$4.8 million. This amount was insignificant in 2001. Third, a portion of the operating expenses associated with certain high profile retail stores are allocated from the Retail segment to
corporate marketing expense. Allocation of these expenses reflects the unique nature of these stores which, given their larger size and extraordinary design elements, function as vehicles for general
corporate marketing, corporate events, and brand 


82






 





awareness. Allocated operating costs are those in excess of operating costs incurred by one of the Company's more typical retail locations. Stores were open in two such high profile locations in New
York and Los Angeles as of September 28, 2002, both of which were opened in fiscal 2002. Expenses allocated to corporate marketing resulting from the operations of these two stores was
$1 million in 2002.

A
large portion of the Company's net sales is derived from its international operations. Also, a majority of the raw materials used in the Company's products is obtained from sources outside of the
United States, and a majority of the products sold by the Company is assembled internationally in the Company's facilities in Cork, Ireland and Singapore or by third-party vendors in Taiwan, Korea,
Mexico, the People's Republic of China, and the Czech Republic. As a result, the Company is subject to risks associated with foreign operations, such as obtaining governmental permits and approvals,
currency exchange fluctuations, currency restrictions, political instability, labor problems, trade restrictions, and changes in tariff and freight charges. During 2000, a single distributor, Ingram
Micro Inc. accounted for approximately 11.5% of the Company's net sales. Net sales during 2000 to Ingram Micro Inc. in the Americas and Europe segments were $651 million and
$255 million, respectively. Net sales to Ingram Micro Inc. in all other segments were $14 million. No other single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2000. No
single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2002 or 2001.

Options
to purchase 101.8 million shares of common stock were outstanding at the end of 2002 that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for that year because the
options' exercise price was greater than the average market price of the Company's common shares for that year and, therefore, the effect would be antidilutive. At September 29, 2001, the
Company had options to purchase 97.2 million shares of its common stock outstanding, all of which were excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share for 2001 because the effect would
have been antidilutive. Options to purchase 2.5 million shares of common stock were outstanding at the end of 2000 that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for
that year because the options' exercise price was greater than the average market price of the Company's common shares for that year and, therefore, the effect would be antidilutive. 


Note 13Related Party Transactions  


Mr. Jerome
York, a member of the Board of the Directors of the Company, is a member of an investment group that purchased MicroWarehouse, Inc.
("
MicroWarehouse
") in January 2000. He also serves as its Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. MicroWarehouse is a multi-billion
dollar specialty catalog and online retailer and direct marketer of computer products, including products made by the 


86






 



Company, through its MacWarehouse catalog. MicroWarehouse accounted for 3.3% and 2.89% of the Company's net sales in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Trade receivables from MicroWarehouse were
$20.9 million and $7.6 million as of September 28, 2002, and September 29, 2001, respectively. These receivables are subject to the same credit risk as the Company's other
trade receivables. In addition, the Company purchases miscellaneous equipment and supplies from MicroWarehouse. Total purchases amounted to approximately $2.9 million in 2002 and
$3.4 million in 2001. 


In
March 2002, the Company entered into a Reimbursement Agreement with its Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Steven P. Jobs, for the reimbursement of expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs in
the operation of his private plane when used for Apple business. The Reimbursement Agreement is effective for expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs for Apple business purposes since he took delivery of
the plane in May 2001. During 2002, the Company recognized a total of $1,168,000 in expenses pursuant to this reimbursement agreement related to expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs during 2001
and 2002. 


In
connection with a relocation assistance package, the Company loaned Mr. Ronald B. Johnson, Senior Vice President, Retail, $1.5 million for the purchase of his principal residence. The
loan is secured by a deed of trust and is due and payable in May 2004. Under the terms of the loan, Mr. Johnson agreed that should he exercise any of his stock options prior to the due
date of the loan, that he would pay the Company an amount equal to the lesser of (1) an amount equal to 50% of the total net gain realized
from the exercise of the options; or (2) $375,000 multiplied by the number of years between the exercise date and the date of the loan.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

The Shareholders and Board of Directors of Apple Computer, Inc.

We  have  audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  of  Apple
Computer, Inc. as of September 29, 1995 and September 30, 1994,  and  the
related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 1995.
Our  audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
Index  to  Consolidated Financial Statements.  These financial statements
and  schedule  are the responsibility of the Company's management.   Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedule based on our audits.

We  conducted  our audits in accordance with generally accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain  reasonable assurance about whether the financial  statements  are
free  of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on  a  test
basis,  evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures  in the financial
statements.   An audit also includes assessing the accounting  principles
used  and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In  our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to  above
present  fairly,  in  all  material respects, the consolidated  financial
position of Apple Computer, Inc. at September 29, 1995 and September  30,
1994,  and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash  flows
for  each  of the three years in the period ended September 29, 1995,  in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  Also,  in  our
opinion,  the  related financial statement schedule, when  considered  in
relation  to  the  basic financial statements taken as a  whole,  present
fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation
The  consolidated  financial statements include  the  accounts  of  Apple
Computer, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company).  Intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated.  The Company's fiscal year-end  is
the last Friday in September.

Revenue Recognition
The  Company  recognizes  revenue  at  the  time  products  are  shipped.
Provisions  are  made currently for estimated product returns  and  price
protection  that may occur under Company programs.  Historically,  actual
amounts recorded for product returns and price protection have not varied
significantly from estimated amounts.

Warranty Expense
The  Company  provides  currently for the  estimated  cost  that  may  be
incurred under product warranties when products are shipped.

Advertising Costs
Advertising  costs,  except  for  costs associated  with  direct-response
advertising, are charged to expense the first time the advertising  takes
place.    The  costs of direct-response advertising are  capitalized  and
amortized over the period during which future benefits are expected to be
received.

Foreign Currency
Gains  and  losses  resulting  from  foreign  currency  translation   are
accumulated  as  a separate component of shareholders' equity  until  the
foreign  entity  is sold or liquidated. Gains and losses  resulting  from
foreign  currency transactions are included in the consolidated statement
of income.

Financial Instruments
Investments
All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less  at
the  date  of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents; investments
with  maturities  between three and twelve months are  considered  to  be
short-term investments.  There are no investments with maturities greater
than  twelve months.  A substantial portion of the Company's  cash,  cash
equivalents,  and short-term investments is held by foreign  subsidiaries
and is generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings.  Amounts held
by  foreign  subsidiaries would be subject to U.S. income  taxation  upon
repatriation  to  the  United States; the Company's financial  statements
fully  provide  for  any related tax liability on  amounts  that  may  be
repatriated,  aside from undistributed earnings that are intended  to  be
indefinitely invested.

Effective  October  1,  1994,  the Company adopted  Financial  Accounting
Standard No. 115 ("FAS 115"), "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and  Equity  Securities."   In  accordance with  FAS  115,  prior  period
financial  statements  have not been restated to reflect  the  change  in
accounting  principle.   The cumulative effect  of  the  change  was  not
material  to shareholders' equity as of October 1, 1994.  Under FAS  115,
debt  securities that a company has both the positive intent and  ability
to  hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost.  Debt securities that
a  company  does  not  have the positive intent and ability  to  hold  to
maturity  and all marketable equity securities are classified  as  either
available-for-sale or trading and are carried at fair value.   Generally,
unrealized holding gains and losses on securities classified as available-
for-sale are reported as a component of shareholders' equity.  Unrealized
holding gains and losses on securities classified as trading are included
in earnings.

The  Company's  cash  equivalents consist primarily  of  U.S.  Government
securities, Euro-dollar deposits, and commercial paper with maturities of
three  months  or  less at the date of purchase.  Short-term  investments
consist  principally of Euro-dollar deposits and  commercial  paper  with
maturities  between  three and twelve months.  The  Company's  marketable
equity  securities consist of securities issued by U.S. corporations  and
are included in "Other assets" on the accompanying balance sheet.  As  of
September   29,   1995,   the  Company's  cash  equivalents,   short-term
investments,   and  marketable  equity  securities  are  classified   and
accounted  for  as  available-for-sale  and  are  generally  held   until
maturity.

Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk
In the ordinary course of business and as part of the Company's asset and
liability   management,  the  Company  enters  into  various   types   of
transactions that involve contracts and financial instruments  with  off-
balance-sheet  risk.   These instruments are entered  into  in  order  to
manage  financial  market  risk,  primarily  interest  rate  and  foreign
exchange risk.  The Company enters into these financial instruments  with
major international financial institutions utilizing over-the-counter  as
opposed  to  exchange traded instruments.  The Company does not  hold  or
transact   in  financial  instruments  for  other  than  risk  management
purposes.

                                        
                                       24



Gains  and  losses on accounting hedges of existing assets or liabilities
are  included in the carrying amounts of those assets or liabilities  and
are  ultimately  recognized in income as part of those carrying  amounts.
Gains  and  losses  related  to  qualifying  accounting  hedges  of  firm
commitments  or  anticipated  transactions  are  also  deferred  and  are
recognized  in  income  or as adjustments of carrying  amounts  when  the
hedged  transaction occurs.  Realized and unrealized gains and losses  on
interest  rate  and  foreign exchange contracts that do  not  qualify  as
accounting hedges are recognized quarterly as a component of interest and
other income (expense), net.

The  Company  monitors its interest rate and foreign  exchange  positions
daily  based  on  applicable  and  commonly  used  pricing  models.   The
correlation  between the changes in the fair value of hedging instruments
and  the  changes in the underlying hedged items is assessed periodically
over  the  life  of  the  hedged instrument.  In the  event  that  it  is
determined that a hedge is ineffective, the Company recognizes in  income
the change in market value of the instrument beginning on the date it was
no longer an effective hedge.

Interest Rate Derivatives
The  Company enters into interest rate derivative transactions, including
interest rate swaps and options, with financial institutions in order  to
better  match  the Company's floating-rate interest income  on  its  cash
equivalents  and  short-term  investments with  the  fixed-rate  interest
expense  of  its  long-term debt.  These instruments  are  also  used  to
diversify  a portion of the Company's exposure away from fluctuations  in
short-term  U.S.  interest  rates.   The  Company  may  also  enter  into
interest  rate  contracts that are intended to reduce  the  cost  of  the
interest rate risk management program.

Foreign Currency Instruments
The  Company  enters into foreign exchange forward and  option  contracts
with   financial  institutions  primarily  to  protect  against  currency
exchange risks associated with certain firmly committed and certain other
probable,  but not firmly committed transactions.  The Company's  foreign
exchange  risk management policy requires it to hedge a majority  of  its
existing  material foreign exchange transaction exposures.  However,  the
Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures that
are  immaterial either in terms of their minimal U.S. dollar value  or  in
terms of their high correlation with the U.S. dollar.

Probable,  but not firmly committed transactions comprise  sales  of  the
Company's products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.  A  majority
of  these  non-U.S.  dollar-based sales are made  through  the  Company's
subsidiaries in Europe, Asia (particularly Japan), Canada, and Australia.
The  Company  also purchases foreign exchange option contracts  to  hedge
certain  other  probable,  but  not firmly committed  transactions.   The
Company  also  sells  foreign  exchange option  contracts,  in  order  to
partially finance the purchase of foreign exchange option contracts  used
to hedge both firmly committed and certain other probable, but not firmly
committed  transactions.   In addition, the  Company  enters  into  other
foreign  exchange  transactions, which are intended to reduce  the  costs
associated  with  its  foreign exchange risk  management  programs.   The
duration  of  foreign exchange hedging instruments,  whether  for  firmly
committed   transactions  or  for  probable,  but  not  firmly  committed
transactions, currently does not exceed one year.

For  further information regarding the Company's accounting treatment  of
its investments and other financial and derivative instruments, refer  to
pages 26 - 28 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Income Taxes

The  income  tax  provisions for 1995 and 1994 have  been  determined  in
accordance with statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 109  ("FAS
109"),  "Accounting  for Income Taxes," whereby deferred  tax  assets  and
liabilities   reflect  the  future  income  tax  effects   of   temporary
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of  existing
assets  and  liabilities and their respective tax  bases.   Deferred  tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to
taxable  income  in  the years in which those temporary  differences  are
expected  to  be  recovered or settled.   The  Company  adopted  FAS  109
effective  the first day of fiscal 1994 on a prospective basis,  and  the
financial statements of years ended prior to 1994 have not been restated.
The cumulative effect of the change was not material.  Prior to 1994, the
Company  accounted for income taxes under the provisions of  APB  Opinion
No.  11,  which  recognized  deferred taxes  for  the  effect  of  timing
differences  between pretax accounting income and taxable income.   Under
the  deferred  method  of  APB Opinion No. 11, deferred  taxes  were  not
adjusted for subsequent changes in tax rates.

U.S.  income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total  of  $395
million  of  undistributed earnings of certain of the  Company's  foreign
subsidiaries.   It is intended that these earnings will  be  indefinitely
invested  in  operations  outside  of  the  United  States.   It  is  not
practicable to determine the income tax liability that might be  incurred
if  these  earnings were to be distributed.  Except for such indefinitely
invested  earnings,  the Company provides for federal  and  state  income
taxes currently on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.

Earnings per Share
Earnings  per  share  is computed using the weighted  average  number  of
   common and dilutive common equivalent shares attributable

                                       25



to  stock  options  outstanding during the period.   Loss  per  share  is
computed  using the weighted average number of common shares  outstanding
during the period.

Inventories
Inventories  are  stated  at the lower of cost (first-in,  first-out)  or
market.   If  the  cost  of the inventories exceeds their  market  value,
provisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the
market value.

Property, Plant, and Equipment
Property,  plant,  and  equipment is stated at  cost.   Depreciation  and
amortization  is computed by use of the declining balance  and  straight-
line methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets.

Stock-Based Compensation
The  Company  has  not  elected early adoption  of  Financial  Accounting
Standard  No. 123 ("FAS 123"), "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation."
FAS  123 becomes effective beginning with the Company's first quarter  of
fiscal  year  1997, and will not have a material effect on the  Company's
financial position or results of operations.  Upon adoption of  FAS  123,
the  Company will continue to measure compensation expense for its stock-
based  employee  compensation  plans using  the  intrinsic  value  method
prescribed  by  APB  Opinion  No.  25, "Accounting  for  Stock  Issued  to
Employees"  and  will provide pro forma disclosures  of  net  income  and
earnings  per share as if the fair value-based method prescribed  by  FAS
123 had been applied in measuring compensation expense.

Reclassifications
Certain  prior  year  amounts  on  the Consolidated  Balance  Sheets  and
Consolidated  Statements  of  Cash Flows and  the  Industry  Segment  and
Geographic  Information and Income Taxes footnotes have been reclassified
to conform to the current year presentation.

(A)   The  $2  million represents gross unrealized gains on  interest  rate
hedging transactions.

Gross unrealized holding gains or losses on available-for-sale securities
are  recorded  as  a component of shareholders' equity, and  include  any
unrealized gains and losses on interest rate contracts accounted  for  as
hedges  against the underlying securities.  Of the $42 million  of  gross
unrealized gains related to equity securities, approximately $40  million
relates to securities that are restricted from sale until February  1996.
The  gross realized gains recorded to earnings on sales of available-for-
sale  securities were $1.5 million in 1995.  There were no gross realized
losses recorded to earnings on sales of available-for-sale securities  in
1995.    The   cost  of  securities  sold  is  based  on   the   specific
identification method.

Interest Rate Derivatives and Foreign Currency Instruments
The table on page 27 shows the notional principal, fair value, and credit
risk amounts of the Company's interest rate derivative and

                                       26



foreign currency instruments as of September 29, 1995, and September  30,
1994.   The  notional principal amounts for off-balance-sheet instruments
provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of year end,
and  do  not represent the amount of the Company's exposure to credit  or
market  loss.  The credit risk amount shown in the table below represents
the  Company's  gross  exposure to potential  accounting  loss  on  these
transactions  if  all counterparties failed to perform according  to  the
terms  of  the  contract,  based on then-current  currency  exchange  and
interest rates at each respective date.  The Company's exposure to credit
loss  and market risk will vary over time as a function of interest rates
and currency exchange rates.

The  estimates  of fair value are based on applicable and  commonly  used
pricing  models  using  prevailing financial  market  information  as  of
September  29, 1995, and September 30, 1994.  In certain instances  where
judgment is required in estimating fair value, price quotes were obtained
from  several  of  the  Company's  counterparty  financial  institutions.
Although the table below reflects the notional principal, fair value, and
credit  risk amounts of the Company's interest rate and foreign  exchange
instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with  the
exposures  and  transactions that the interest rate and foreign  exchange
instruments are intended to hedge.  The amounts ultimately realized  upon
settlement  of these financial instruments, together with the  gains  and
losses  on  the  underlying  exposures,  will  depend  on  actual  market
conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.

(A) Fair value is less than $0.5 million.

The  interest rate swaps shown above generally require the Company to pay
a  floating interest rate based on the three- or six-month U.S. dollar  LIBOR
and  receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of the underlying
notional amounts.  Maturity dates for interest rate swaps currently range
from  one  to ten years.  At September 29, 1995, and September 30,  1994,
interest  rate  swaps  classified  as receive-fixed  swaps  had  weighted
average receive rates of 6.38% and 5.89%, respectively.  Weighted average
pay  rates on these swaps were 5.88% and 6.52% at September 29, 1995, and
September 30, 1994, respectively.  Interest rate option contracts require
the  Company  to make payments should certain interest rates either  fall
below or rise above predetermined levels.

Interest  rate  collars limit the Company's exposure to  fluctuations  in
short-term  interest rates by locking in a range of  interest  rates.  An
interest  rate collar is a no-cost structure that consists of a purchased
option and a sold option. The Company receives a payment when the three-month
LIBOR  falls below predetermined levels, and makes a payment when the three-
month  LIBOR  rises  above  predetermined levels.  The  entire  structure
generally qualifies as an accounting hedge.

All  interest  rate option contracts outstanding at September  29,  1995,
expire within three years.

Interest rate contracts not accounted for as hedges are carried  at  fair
value with gains and losses recorded currently in income as a

                                       27



component of interest and other income (expense), net.  Unrealized  gains
and  losses on interest rate contracts that are designated and  effective
as hedges are deferred and recognized in income in the same period as the
hedged   transaction.   Unrealized  losses  on  such  agreements  totaled
approximately  $9  million and $40 million at  September  29,  1995,  and
September  30, 1994, respectively, primarily reflecting the  net  present
value  of  unrealized  losses  on  the  ten-year  swap  contracts,  which
effectively  convert the Company's fixed-rate ten-year debt to  floating-
rate debt.

The  foreign exchange forward contracts not accounted for as  hedges  are
carried  at  fair  value  and are adjusted each balance  sheet  date  for
changes in exchange rates, and the adjustment is recognized in income  at
that  time.   Unrealized  gains and losses on  foreign  exchange  forward
contracts  that are designated and effective as hedges are  deferred  and
recognized  in  income  in  the same period as the  hedged  transactions.
Deferred  gains and losses on such agreements at September 29, 1995,  and
September  30,  1994,  were  immaterial.  All  foreign  exchange  forward
contracts expire within one year.

Purchased  foreign  exchange  option contracts  that  qualify  for  hedge
accounting  treatment are reported on the balance sheet  at  the  premium
cost,  which is amortized over the life of the option.  Unrealized  gains
and losses on these option contracts are deferred until the occurrence of
the  hedged  transaction  and recognized as a  component  of  the  hedged
transaction.    Deferred  gains  and  losses  on  such  agreements   were
immaterial  at  September  29,  1995, and  September  30,  1994.   As  of
September 29, 1995, maturity dates for purchased foreign exchange  option
contracts ranged from one to twelve months.

Purchased and sold foreign exchange option contracts that do not  qualify
for  hedge accounting treatment are carried at fair value and,  as  such,
are  adjusted  each  balance sheet date for changes  in  exchange  rates.
Gains and losses associated with these financial instruments are recorded
currently in income.  As of September 29, 1995, maturity dates for  these
sold option contracts ranged from one to six months.

The  Company  monitors its interest rate and foreign  exchange  positions
daily  based  on  applicable  and  commonly  used  pricing  models.   The
correlation  between the changes in the fair value of hedging instruments
and  the  changes in the underlying hedged items is assessed periodically
over  the  life  of  the  hedged instrument.  In the  event  that  it  is
determined that a hedge is ineffective, the Company recognizes in  income
the change in market value of the instrument beginning on the date it was
no longer an effective hedge.

Fair Values of Other Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company's other financial
instruments are as follows:

Short-term  investments are carried at cost plus accrued interest,  which
approximates  fair  value.  The carrying amount of short-term  borrowings
approximates  their fair value due to their short-term  maturities.   The
fair  value  of  the ten-year unsecured notes is based  on  their  listed
market value as of September 29, 1995.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

The  Company  distributes  its products principally  through  third-party
computer   resellers   and  various  education  and  consumer   channels.
Concentrations  of  credit  risk with respect to  trade  receivables  are
limited  because  of  flooring arrangements for selected  customers  with
third-party  financing companies and because the Company's customer  base
consists  of large numbers of geographically diverse customers  dispersed
across  several  industries.   As such, the Company  generally  does  not
require collateral from its customers.

The   counterparties  to  the  agreements  relating  to   the   Company's
investments and foreign exchange and interest rate instruments consist of
a number of major international financial institutions.  To date, no such
counterparty has failed to meet its financial obligations to the Company.
The  Company  does  not  believe  that  there  is  significant  risk   of
nonperformance  by  these counterparties because the Company  continually
monitors its positions and the credit ratings of such counterparties, and
limits the financial

                                       28



exposure  and the number of agreements and contracts it enters into  with
any  one  party.  The Company generally does not require collateral  from
counterparties, except for margin agreements associated with the ten-year
interest  rate  swaps on the Company's long-term debt.  To  mitigate  the
credit risk associated with these ten-year swap transactions, the Company
entered   into   margining   agreements   with   its   third-party   bank
counterparties.   Margining under these agreements does not  start  until
1997.   Furthermore, these agreements would require the  Company  or  the
counterparty  to post margin only if certain credit risk thresholds  were
exceeded.

Advertising Costs

There  were  no direct-response advertising costs reported as  assets  at
September  29,  1995,  and September 30, 1994.  Advertising  expense  was
$204.7  million, $158.2 million, and $153.4 million for 1995,  1994,  and
1993, respectively.

The  weighted  average interest rates for Japanese yen-denominated  notes
payable  to  banks at September 29, 1995, and September  30,  1994,  were
approximately 2.2% and 2.6%, respectively.  The weighted average interest
rate for U.S. dollar-denominated notes payable to banks at September  29,
1995, was approximately 6.2%.  The Company had no U.S. dollar-denominated
notes  payable  to  banks at September 30, 1994.   The  weighted  average
interest rate for commercial paper borrowings at September 30, 1994,  was
approximately 5.0%.  Interest expense on short-term borrowings was  $20.4
million,  $24.9  million,  and $8.9 million for  1995,  1994,  and  1993,
respectively.

Long-Term Debt

On February 10, 1994, the Company issued $300 million aggregate principal
amount  of 6.5% unsecured notes in a public offering registered with  the
Securities  and Exchange Commission.  The notes were sold at  99.925%  of
par, for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%.  The notes pay interest
semi-annually and mature on February 15, 2004.  Interest expense on long-
term debt for the years ended September 29, 1995, and September 30, 1994,
was $19.5 million and $12.5 million, respectively.

For  information regarding the Company's estimated fair value  of  short-
term  and  long-term debt, refer to page 28 of the Notes to  Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Restructuring of Operations

In the third quarter of 1993, the Company initiated a plan to restructure
its  operations worldwide in order to address the competitive  conditions
in  the personal computer industry, including the increased market demand
for  lower-priced  products.  In connection with this plan,  the  Company
recorded  a  $321 million charge to operating expenses ($199 million,  or
$1.72  per  share, after taxes).  The restructuring costs  included  $162
million  of  estimated  employee-related expenses  and  $159  million  of
estimated facilities, equipment, and other expenses associated  with  the
consolidation of operations and the relocation and termination of certain
operations and employees.  The restructuring plan originally contemplated
the  termination or relocation of approximately 4,150 employees worldwide
and  a reduction in worldwide office space, which primarily consisted  of
approximately  1.6  million  square feet  of  office  space  in  the  San
Francisco  Bay Area, within one year from the date the restructuring  was
initiated.

In  the  third quarter of 1994, the Company lowered its estimate  of  the
total costs associated with the restructuring and recorded an
adjustment that increased income by $127 million ($79 million,  or  $0.66
per  share,  after  taxes).   This  adjustment  primarily  reflected  the
modification or cancelation of certain elements of the Company's original
restructuring  plan because of changing business and economic  conditions
that  made  certain elements of the restructuring plan  financially  less
attractive  than originally anticipated.  In addition, some actions  were
completed at a lower cost than originally estimated.

The  most  significant element of the adjustment was associated with  $61
million in costs accrued to terminate or move a number of employees  from
the San Francisco Bay Area to a lower-cost location.  This element of the
Company's restructuring plan was expected to result in the termination or
relocation  of approximately 2,000 employees and the closure  of  certain
leased facilities, at a

                                       29



cost of $39 million and $22 million, respectively.  However, the expected
benefits of this move were reduced since the plan's inception because  of
changes  to  the  cost  differential between the  Company's  current  and
alternative  locations.  For example, the Company favorably  renegotiated
the  lease  terms  of  certain facilities in its current  locations,  the
salary  growth  rate differentials between the Bay Area  and  alternative
locations  were  reduced, and changes to the California income  tax  laws
made it more attractive for companies to do business in California.   The
Company  canceled  this  action  in  the  third  quarter  of  1994,  when
management decided that the extended estimated pay-back period no  longer
justified  the  initial  cash investment and the unquantifiable  cost  of
business disruption that such a move would precipitate.

At  the  end of fiscal year 1994, approximately 1,760 employees had  been
terminated  at  a  cost  of  approximately  $95  million  in  termination
benefits,  and  approximately 80 had been  relocated.   The  Company  had
reduced  its use of office space in the Bay Area by approximately 867,000
square feet.

During  1995,  the  Company further lowered its estimates  of  the  total
remaining costs associated with its restructuring plan initiated  in  the
third quarter of 1993 and recorded an adjustment that increased income by
$23  million  ($14  million,  or $0.12 per  share,  after  taxes).   This
adjustment  primarily  reflected  favorable  cancelation  settlements  of
certain R&D project commitments and facility leases and the completion of
other actions at lower costs than originally estimated.

As  of  September  29,  1995,  the Company had  $11  million  of  accrued
restructuring  costs  for  actions that  are  currently  under  way,  the
majority   of   which   are  expected  to  be  completed   during   1996.
Approximately  $10  million  of  this  accrual  represents  cash  charges
expected  to  be  incurred primarily for estimated facilities  and  other
expenses.

The  foreign  provision  for  income taxes is  based  on  foreign  pretax
earnings of approximately $572 million, $474 million, and $416 million in
1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.  The tax benefit credited directly to
common stock as a result of compensation expense attributable to employee
stock  option  and  purchase plans recognized differently  for  financial
reporting and tax purposes was $15 million in 1995.

Under  FAS  109, deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect  the  future
income  tax  effects  of  temporary  differences  between  the  financial
statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective
tax bases.

At September 29, 1995, and September 30, 1994, the significant components
of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities were:

The  net change in the total valuation allowance was an increase of $3 million

Under  APB  Opinion  No.  11, deferred income taxes  result  from  timing
differences  between  years in the recognition  of  certain  revenue  and
expense  items for financial and tax reporting purposes.  The sources  of
timing differences and the related tax effects for 1993 are as follows:

The  Internal  Revenue Service ("IRS") has proposed  federal  income  tax
deficiencies  for the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company  has  made
certain   prepayments  thereon.   The  Company  contested  the   proposed
deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1988, and most of the  issues  in
dispute  for these years have been resolved.  On June 29, 1995,  the  IRS
issued  a notice of deficiency proposing increases to the amount  of  the
Company's  federal  income taxes for the years 1989  through  1991.   The
Company  has filed a petition with the United States Tax Court to contest
these  alleged  tax  deficiencies.   Management  believes  that  adequate
provision  has been made for any adjustments that may result  from  these
tax examinations.

Common Stock

Shareholder Rights Plan
In   May  1989,  the  Company  adopted  a  shareholder  rights  plan  and
distributed a dividend of one right to purchase one share of common stock
(a  "Right")  for each outstanding share of common stock of the  Company.
The  Rights become exercisable in certain limited circumstances involving
a  potential  business combination transaction of  the  Company  and  are
initially  exercisable at a price of $200 per share.   Following  certain
other  events  after  the  Rights  have become  exercisable,  each  Right
entitles its holder to purchase for $200 an amount of common stock of the
Company, or, in certain circumstances, securities of the acquiror, having
a then-current market value of two times the exercise price of the Right.
The  Rights  are  redeemable and may be amended at the  Company's  option
before  they become exercisable.  Until a Right is exercised, the  holder
of  a Right, as such, has no rights as a shareholder of the Company.  The
Rights expire on April 19, 1999.

Stock Option Plans
The  Company has in effect a 1990 Stock Option Plan (the "1990 Plan") and
a 1987 Executive Long Term Stock Option Plan (the "1987 Plan").  The 1981
Stock  Option  Plan terminated in October 1990.  Options  granted  before
that date remain outstanding in accordance with their terms.  Options may
be  granted  under  the  1990 Plan to employees, including  officers  and
directors who are
                                        
                                       32



employees, at not less than the fair market value on the date  of  grant.
These  options generally become exercisable over a period of three years,
based  on continued employment, and generally expire ten years after  the
grant  date.   The  1990  Plan permits the granting  of  incentive  stock
options, nonstatutory stock options, and stock appreciation rights.

The  1987  Plan permits the granting of nonstatutory options  to  certain
officers of the Company to purchase Apple common stock at prices not less
than 75% of the fair market value on the date of grant. Options under the
1987  Plan are generally not exercisable for 18 months after the date  of
grant,  and  then become exercisable at varying rates over the subsequent
seven years, based on continued service to the Company.

In  July  1995, the Board of Directors adopted an amendment to  the  1990
Plan  to  increase  the number of shares reserved  for  issuance  by  8.6
million  shares, subject to shareholder approval at the Company's  Annual
Meeting  of  Shareholders scheduled for January 1996.  Concurrently,  the
Board  of Directors also resolved to terminate the 1987 Plan and transfer
all unused shares remaining under the 1987 Plan to the 1990 Plan, subject
to shareholder approval of the aforementioned amendment to the 1990 Plan.

Restricted Stock Plan
On  April 1, 1993, the Company's Board of Directors approved a Restricted
Stock  Plan  for  officers  of  the Company  (the  "RSP"),  which  became
effective  July  1,  1993.   The  RSP was subsequently  ratified  by  the
shareholders  on  January 26, 1994.  The RSP is designed  to  provide  an
incentive for officers to continue to own shares of the Company's  common
stock  acquired upon exercise of options under any of the Company's Stock
Option  Plans,  thus more closely aligning officers' financial  interests
with  those  of  the  shareholders.  The RSP provides that  officers  who
exercise stock options and continue to hold the exercised shares  for  at
least three years will receive up to three awards of shares of restricted
stock.   Each such award is for one-third the number of shares  held  for
the  requisite  retention period.  Each restricted  stock  award  granted
pursuant  to  the plan becomes fully vested three years after  the  grant
date, provided that the officer maintains continuous employment with  the
Company and that other vesting requirements are met.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The  Company  has  an employee stock purchase plan (the "Purchase  Plan")
under which substantially all employees may purchase common stock through
payroll  deductions  at a price equal to 85% of the  lower  of  the  fair
market  values as of the beginning or end of the offering period.   Stock
purchases  under  the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of  an  employee's
compensation,  up to a maximum of $25,000 in any calendar  year.   As  of
September 29, 1995, approximately 18,000 shares were reserved for  future
issuance  under the Purchase Plan.   In June 1995, the Board of Directors
adopted  an  amendment  to the Purchase Plan to increase  the  number  of
shares  reserved for issuance by 3 million shares, subject to shareholder
approval  at  the Company's Annual Meeting of Shareholders scheduled  for
January 1996.

Stock Repurchase Programs
In November 1992, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to
10  million shares of the Company's common stock in the open market.   No
shares  were  repurchased under this authorization in 1995  or  in  1994;
approximately   3.4   million   shares  were   repurchased   under   this
authorization  in  1993.   In  September 1990,  the  Board  of  Directors
authorized  the  purchase  of up to 10 million shares  of  the  Company's
common  stock  in the open market.  During 1993, the Company  repurchased
the  remaining  shares under this authorization, which  approximated  1.6
million shares.

Employee Savings Plan

The  Company  has  an  employee savings plan (the  "Savings  Plan")  that
qualifies  as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k)  of  the
Internal  Revenue  Code.   Under  the Savings  Plan,  participating  U.S.
employees  may  defer  a  portion of their pretax  earnings,  up  to  the
Internal  Revenue Service annual contribution limit ($9,240 for  calendar
year  1995).  Effective October 1, 1995, the Company matches 50% to  100%
of each employee's contributions, depending on length of service, up to a
maximum  6%  of the employee's earnings.  Prior to October 1,  1995,  the
Company matched 30% to 70% of each employee's contributions, depending on
length  of  service, up to a maximum 6% of the employee's earnings.   The
Company's  matching contributions to the Savings Plan were  approximately
$14.6  million, $10.7 million, and $11.1 million in 1995, 1994, and 1993,
respectively.

Preferred Stock

Five  million shares of preferred stock have been authorized for issuance
in  one or more series.  The Board of Directors is authorized to fix  the
number  and  designation of any such series and to determine the  rights,
preferences,  privileges, and restrictions granted to or imposed  on  any
such series.

Commitments and Contingencies

Lease Commitments

The  Company  leases various facilities and equipment under noncancelable
operating lease arrangements.  The major facilities leases are for  terms
of 5 to 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of up to
5  additional  years.   Rent  expense  under  all  operating  leases  was
approximately $127 million, $122 million, and $170 million in 1995, 1994,
and  1993,  respectively.   Future minimum  lease  payments  under  these
noncancelable  operating leases having remaining terms in excess  of  one
year as of September 29, 1995, are as follows:

Litigation

Apple v. Microsoft Corporation and Hewlett-Packard Company
In  March 1988, the Company filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the
Northern   District   of  California  (the  "Court")  against   Microsoft
Corporation  ("Microsoft") and Hewlett-Packard  Company  ("HP")  alleging
that  their  Microsoft Windows and HP NewWave computer programs  infringe
the  Company's  audiovisual  copyrights  protecting  the  Macintosh  user
interface.  On August 24, 1993, the district court entered final judgment
for Microsoft and HP, dismissing the Company's action.

On  September 21, 1993, the Court denied defendants' motions for an award
of  full  defense costs and attorneys' fees under 17 U.S.C. Section  505,
but  allowed  defendants to renew their motions should the Supreme  Court
alter the standard for the award of attorneys' fees in copyright cases in
the case of Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., 114 S. Ct. 1023 (1994).
            ------------------------

On September 20, 1993, the Company appealed the case to the U.S. Court of
Appeals  for  the  Ninth Circuit.  On September 24, 1994,  the  Court  of
Appeals issued its decision affirming the district court judgment on  the
merits but remanding the case on the issue of attorneys' fees in light of
the  Fogerty   decision.   The Company filed a petition  for  a  writ  of
     -------                                                  -----------
certiorari  in  the Supreme Court of the United States  on  December  19,
- ----------
1994.

The Company's petition for a writ of certiorari was denied by the Supreme
                             ------------------
Court  of  the  United  States on February 21,  1995.   Accordingly,  the
decision  of the appellate court affirming the dismissal of the Company's
copyright  infringement case against Microsoft and HP is now final.   The
requests  of  Microsoft and HP for attorneys' fees have been resolved  by
settlement  agreements.   Accordingly,  the  matter  has  been   entirely
resolved.

location  of  the  customers.   Transfers between  geographic  areas  are
recorded at amounts generally above cost and in accordance with the rules
and  regulations of the respective governing tax authorities.   Operating
income  (loss)  by  geographic area consists  of  total  net  sales  less
operating  expenses,  and  does  not include  an  allocation  of  general
corporate  expenses.  The restructuring charge recorded in 1993  and  the
related  adjustments  recorded  in 1995 and  1994  are  included  in  the
calculation  of  operating  income  (loss)  for  each  geographic   area.
Identifiable  assets of geographic areas are those  assets  used  in  the
Company's  operations in each area.  Corporate assets  include  cash  and
cash equivalents, joint venture investments, and short-term investments.

The  Company began declaring quarterly cash dividends on its common stock

Market during each quarter.

adjustment  that increased income by $17 million ($11 million,  or  $0.09
per  share,  after  taxes).  Net income for the  third  quarter  of  1995
includes  a restructuring adjustment that increased income by $6  million
($4  million, or $0.03 per share, after taxes).  Net income for the third
quarter of 1994 includes a restructuring adjustment that increased income
by $127 million ($79 million, or $0.66 per share, after taxes).

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
 


Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  


Apple
Computer, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) designs, manufactures and markets personal computers and related software, services, peripherals and networking solutions. The Company also
designs, develops and markets a line of portable digital music players along with related accessories and services including the online distribution of third-party music and audio books. The Company
sells its products worldwide through its online stores, its own retail stores, its direct sales force and third-party wholesalers, resellers and value added resellers. In addition to its own hardware,
software and peripheral products, the Company sells a variety of third-party hardware and software products through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to education, consumer, creative
professional, business and government customers. 


Basis of Presentation and Preparation  


The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these
consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior year amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 


Typically,
the Company's fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of September. Fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002 were each 52-week years. However, approximately every six years, the Company
reports a 53-week fiscal year to align its fiscal quarters with calendar quarters by adding a week to its first fiscal quarter. The Company expects to add this additional week in its first
fiscal quarter of 2006. All information presented herein is based on the Company's fiscal calendar. 


Financial Instruments  


Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments  


All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. Highly liquid investments with maturities
greater than three months are classified as short-term investments. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments in debt and marketable equity securities at the
time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date. The Company's debt and marketable equity securities have been classified and accounted for as
available-for-sale. These securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of shareholders' equity. The cost of
securities sold is based upon the specific identification method. 


Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity  


On May 15, 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 150, 
 
Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of
Both Liabilities and Equity
. SFAS No. 150 requires issuers to classify as
liabilities (or assets in some circumstances) certain freestanding financial instruments that embody obligations for the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The Company
adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 150 on June 29, 2003, which resulted in a favorable cumulative-effect type adjustment of approximately $3 million. This adjustment related to a
forward purchase agreement that allowed the Company to acquire 1.5 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $16.64 per share for a total cost of $25.5 million. The
Company settled this forward purchase agreement in August 2003, which resulted in an additional gain of 


64








 


approximately
$6 million representing the increase in fair value of the agreement from June 29, 2003 through the settlement date. 


Derivative Financial Instruments  


The Company accounts for its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair
value through income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets,
liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. 


For
derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges, the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported
as a component of other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. To receive hedge
accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure
to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that are designated as fair value hedges, the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the
hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current period. The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as an economic
hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure of the net investment in a foreign operation is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For forward contracts
designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or
losses related to this component are recognized in current earnings. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in the current
period. 


In
accordance with SFAS No. 133, hedges related to probable but not firmly committed transactions of an anticipatory nature are designated and documented at hedge inception as cash flow hedges
and evaluated for hedge effectiveness quarterly. For foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges, hedge effectiveness is measured based on changes in the fair value of the
contract attributable to changes in the forward exchange rate. Changes in the expected future cash flows on the forecasted hedged transaction and changes in the fair value of the forward hedge are
both measured from the contract rate to the forward exchange rate associated with the forward contract's maturity date. For currency option contracts, hedge effectiveness is assessed by comparing the
present value of the cumulative change in expected future cash flows on the hedged transaction to changes in expected cash flow of the option hedge at maturity. The net gains or losses on derivative
instruments qualifying as cash flow hedges are reported as components of other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which
the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any hedge ineffectiveness is recognized in current earnings in other income and expense. For interest rate swap agreements qualifying as fair value hedges, the
Company assumes no ineffectiveness because these swaps meet the criteria for accounting under the short-cut method. 


The
Company may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the translation and economic exposure of a net investment position in a foreign subsidiary. For such contracts, hedge
effectiveness is measured based on changes in the fair value of the contract attributable to changes in the spot exchange rate. The effective portion of the net gain or loss on a derivative instrument
designated as a hedge of the net investment position in a foreign subsidiary is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency 


65








 




translation
adjustment. Any residual changes in fair value of the forward contract, including changes in fair value based on the differential between the spot and forward exchange rates, are
recognized in current earnings in other income and expense. 


Inventories  


Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. If the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are
made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. 


Property, Plant, and Equipment  


Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which
are 30 years for buildings, from 2 to 5 years for equipment, and the shorter of lease terms or 10 years for leasehold improvements. The Company capitalizes eligible costs to
acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 5 years. 


Asset Retirement Obligations  


On September 29, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 143, 
Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations
, which
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. The standard applies to
legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. SFAS No. 143
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of
the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. All of the Company's existing asset retirement
obligations are
associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. The Company estimated that as of September 29, 2002, gross expected
future cash flows of $9.5 million would be required to fulfill these obligations. 


As
of the date of adoption, the Company recorded a $6 million long-term asset retirement liability and a corresponding increase in leasehold improvements. This amount represents the
present value of expected future cash flows associated with returning certain of the Company's leased properties to original condition. The difference between the gross expected future cash flow of
$9.5 million and its present value of $6 million at September 29, 2002, is being accreted over the life of the related leases as an operating expense. Net of the related income
tax effect of approximately $1 million, adoption of SFAS No. 143 resulted in an unfavorable cumulative-effect type adjustment to net income during the first quarter of 2003 of
approximately $2 million. This adjustment represents cumulative depreciation and accretion that would have been recognized through the date of adoption of SFAS No. 143 had the statement
been applied to the Company's existing asset retirement obligations at the time they were initially incurred.

Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets  


The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to
generate. If property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the
assets exceeds its fair market value. For the three years ended September 25, 2004, September 27, 2003, and September 28, 2002 the Company had no material impairment of its
long-lived assets, except for the impairment of certain assets in connection with the restructuring actions described in Note 5. 


The
Company adopted SFAS No. 142, 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
, in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. SFAS No. 142 requires that
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that they may be impaired. Prior to fiscal 2002, goodwill was amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life. The Company completed its transitional
goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2001, and its annual goodwill impairment tests on August 30 of each year thereafter and found no impairment. The Company established reporting
units based on its current reporting structure. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit. 


SFAS
No. 142 also requires that intangible assets with definite lives be amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, 
 
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of
. The Company is currently
amortizing its acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods ranging from 3 to 10 years. 


Foreign Currency Translation  


The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its international non-U.S. functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at
the end of each period. Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are credited
or charged to foreign currency translation included in "accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" in shareholders' equity. The Company's foreign manufacturing subsidiaries and certain other
international subsidiaries that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and inventories,
property, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. Gains and 


67








 


losses
from these translations were insignificant and have been included in the Company's results of operations. 


Revenue Recognition  


Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of products (hardware, software, and peripherals), and extended warranty and support contracts. The Company recognizes
revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards, including Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97-2, 
Software Revenue Recognition
, as
amended, and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, 
Revenue Recognition
. 


The
Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered
delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Company's product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped.
For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company
legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed to not be, fixed or
determinable, revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable. 


Revenue
from extended warranty and support contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the warranty and support periods. These contracts typically include extended phone support, certain
repairs, web-based support resources, diagnostic tools, and extend the Company's one-year basic limited parts and labor warranty. 


The
Company sells software and peripheral products obtained from other companies. The Company establishes its own pricing and retains related inventory risk, is the primary obligor in sales
transactions with its customers, and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue for the sale of products obtained from other companies at
the gross amount billed. 


Revenue
on arrangements that include multiple elements such as hardware, software, and services is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element, which is generally
determined by vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE). Allocated revenue for each element is recognized when revenue recognition criteria have been met for each element. VSOE is determined based on
the price charged when each element is sold separately. 


The
Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end user rebates, and other sales programs
and volume-based incentives. The estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue in the period the Company has sold the product and committed to a plan. The Company also records
reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company's historical experience. 


Generally,
the Company does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales or the sale of extended warranty and support contracts. However, a
limited number of the Company's software products are available with maintenance agreements that grant customers rights to unspecified future upgrades over the maintenance term on a when and if
available basis. Revenue associated with such maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term. 


68








 




Shipping Costs  


The Company's shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales for all periods presented. 


Warranty Expense  


The Company provides currently for the estimated cost for product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. 


Research and Development  


Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning
when a product's technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers pursuant to SFAS No. 86, 
Computer
Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed
. In most instances, the Company's products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. Therefore,
costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally all software development costs have been expensed. 


During
the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company incurred substantial development costs associated with the development of Mac OS X version 10.4 (code-named "Tiger"), which enhances the
features and functionality of the previous version of Mac OS X, subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility as evidenced by public demonstration in August 2004 and subsequent release
of a developer beta version of the product, both of which were prior to the planned release of the final version of the product in the first half of calendar year 2005. Therefore, during the fourth
quarter of 2004, the Company capitalized approximately $4.5 million of costs associated with development of Tiger. Amortization of this asset will begin when Tiger begins shipping and will be
recognized straight-line over a 3 year estimated useful life. 


During
the second quarter of 2004, the Company incurred substantial development costs associated with FileMaker Pro 7 subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility as evidenced by public
demonstration and release of a developer beta version, and prior to the release of the final version of the product in March 2004. Therefore, during the second quarter of 2004, the Company
capitalized approximately $2.3 million of costs associated with the development of FileMaker Pro 7. In accordance with SFAS No. 86, amortization of this asset began in March 2004
when FileMaker Pro 7 was shipped and is being recognized on a straight-line basis over a 3 year estimated useful life. 


During
the third and fourth quarters of 2003, the Company incurred substantial development costs associated with the development of Mac OS X version 10.3 (code-named "Panther"), subsequent
to achievement of technological feasibility as evidenced by public demonstration and release of a developer beta in June 2003, and prior to release of the final version of the product in the
first quarter of 2004. Therefore, during 2003 the Company capitalized approximately $14.7 million of development costs associated with the development of Panther. Amortization of this asset
began in the first quarter of 2004 when Panther was shipped and is being recognized on a straight-line basis in accordance with SFAS No. 86 over a 3 year estimated useful
life. 


During
the third and fourth quarters of 2002, the Company incurred substantial development costs associated with the development of Mac OS X version 10.2 (code-named "Jaguar") subsequent
to achievement of technological feasibility as evidenced by public demonstration and release of a developer beta in May 2002, and prior to release of the final version of the product in the
fourth quarter of 2002. As such, the Company capitalized approximately $13.3 million of development costs associated with development of Jaguar. Amortization of this asset began in the fourth
quarter of 2002 when Jaguar was 


69








 




shipped
and is being recognized on a straight-line basis in accordance with SFAS No. 86 over a 3 year estimated useful life. In addition, during 2002, the Company also began
capitalizing certain costs related to development of its new PowerSchool enterprise student information system. Capitalization of approximately $6 million began upon achievement of
technological feasibility in the first quarter of 2002. The final version of the enterprise student information system was released in July 2002. 


Total
amortization related to capitalized software development costs was $10.7 million, $5.8 million, and $1.2 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 


Advertising Costs  


Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $206 million, $193 million, and $209 million for 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. 


Restructuring Charges  


In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, 
Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
. SFAS
No. 146 supersedes Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94-3, 
Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs
To Exit an Activity (Including Certain Costs Associated with a Restructuring)
 and requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be
recognized when the liability is incurred, as opposed to when management commits to an exit plan. SFAS No. 146 also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at
fair value. This Statement was effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The provisions of SFAS No. 146 were required to be applied prospectively after
the adoption date to newly initiated exit activities. 


Stock-Based Compensation  


The Company measures compensation expense for its employee stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB)
Opinion No. 25, 
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
 The Company applies the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123, 
 
Accounting for Stock-based
Compensation
, as amended by SFAS No. 148
, Accounting for Stock-based
CompensationTransition and Disclosure
 as if the fair value-based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense. The Company has elected to follow APB
Opinion No. 25 because, as discussed below, the alternative fair value accounting provided for under SFAS No. 123 requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use
in valuing employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares. Under APB Opinion No. 25, when the exercise price of the Company's employee stock options equals the market price of
the underlying stock on the date of the grant, no compensation expense is recognized. 


As
required under SFAS No. 123, the pro forma effects of stock-based compensation on net income and earnings per common share for employee stock options granted and employee stock purchase plan
share purchases have been estimated at the date of grant and beginning of the period, respectively, using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated
fair value of the options and shares is amortized to pro forma net income (loss) over the options' vesting period and the shares' plan period. 


The
Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of freely traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option
valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected life of options and the Company's expected stock price volatility. Because the Company's employee stock
options and employee 


70








 




stock
purchase plan shares have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair
value estimate, in management's opinion, the existing models do not provide a reliable measure of the fair value of the Company's employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares. 


For
purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options and shares is amortized to pro forma net income (loss) over the options' vesting period and the shares' plan period. The
Company's pro forma information for each of the last three fiscal years follows (in millions, except per share amounts):

Earnings Per Common Share  


Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period
increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of common stock had been issued. The dilutive effect of
outstanding options, restricted stock and restricted stock units is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in
the fair market value of the Company's common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from outstanding options, restricted stock and restricted stock units. Additionally, the exercise of
employee stock options and the vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units can result in a greater dilutive effect on earnings per share.

Potentially

shares of common stock for the years ended September 25, 2004, September 27, 2003, and September 28, 2002, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per
share for these periods because their effect would have been antidilutive. 


Comprehensive Income  


Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under
generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders' equity but are excluded from net income. The Company's other comprehensive income is comprised of foreign currency
translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as
available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges. 


Segment Information  


The Company reports segment information based on the "management" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions
and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments. Information about the Company's products, major customers, and geographic areas on a company-wide basis is
also disclosed.

The
Company's short-term investment portfolio consists of investments in U.S. Treasury and Agency securities, U.S. corporate securities, and foreign securities. The Company's U.S.
corporate securities consist primarily of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, time deposits and corporate debt securities. Foreign securities consist primarily of foreign commercial paper,
certificates of deposit and time deposits with foreign institutions, most of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company had net unrealized losses totaling $4 million on its investment
portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities less than 1 year as of September 25, 2004 and net unrealized gains of $1 million on its investment portfolio,
primarily related to investments with stated maturities greater than 1 year, as of September 27, 2003. The Company occasionally sells short-term investments prior to their
stated maturities. As a result of such sales, the Company recognized net gains before taxes of $1 million in 2004, $21 million in 2003 and $7 million in 2002. These net gains were
included in interest and other income, net. 


As
of September 25, 2004, approximately $180 million of the Company's short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remaining
short-term investments as of September 25, 2004 had maturities of 3 to 12 months. As of September 27, 2003, approximately $629 million of the Company's
short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remaining short-term investments as of September 27, 2003 had maturities of 3 to

Market
values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. The declines in value of these investments is primarily related to changes in interest rates and are considered
to be temporary in nature. Investments are reviewed periodically to identify possible impairment. When evaluating the investments, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to
which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the investee, and the Company's ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for
anticipated recovery in market value. 


Accounts Receivable  


Trade Receivables  


The Company distributes its products through third-party resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and commercial customers. The Company generally does not require
collateral from its customers. However, when possible the Company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe and Asia
and by arranging with third-party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the Company's direct customers. These credit financing arrangements are
directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.
However, considerable trade
receivables that are not covered by collateral, third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Company's distribution and retail channel partners. No customer
accounted for more than 10% of trade receivables as of September 25, 2004. Trade receivables from a single customer, Ingram Micro, Inc., accounted for approximately 10.3% of net accounts
receivable as of September 27, 2003.

Vendor Non-Trade Receivables  


The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors
who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these raw material components directly from suppliers. These non-trade
receivables, which are included in the consolidated balance sheets in other current assets, totaled $276 million and $184 million as of September 25, 2004 and September 27,
2003, respectively. The Company does not recognize any profits on these sales or reflect the sale of these components in its net sales. 


Inventory Prepayment  


In April 2002, the Company made a $100 million prepayment to an Asian supplier for the purchase of components over the following nine months. In return for this
deposit, the supplier agreed to supply the Company with a specified level of components during the three consecutive fiscal quarters ended December 28, 2002. During the first six months of
2003, the remaining $53 million of the deposit balance was fully utilized for the purchase of components. The deposit was unsecured and had no stated interest component. The Company imputed an
amount to cost of sales and interest income during each period the deposit was outstanding at a 3.25% interest rate to reflect the economics of this transaction. 


Derivative Financial Instruments  


The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. Foreign currency forward and option contracts are used to
offset the foreign exchange risk on certain existing assets and liabilities and to hedge the foreign exchange risk on expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales. From
time to time, the Company enters into interest rate derivative agreements to modify the interest rate profile of certain investments and debt. The Company's accounting policies for these instruments
are based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. 


The
following table shows the notional principal, net fair value, and credit risk amounts of the Company's foreign currency instruments as of September 25, 2004 and September 27, 2003

The
notional principal amounts for derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of year-end, and do not represent the amount of the Company's
exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amount shown in the table above represents the Company's gross exposure to 


75








 




potential
accounting loss on these transactions if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency exchange rates at each
respective date. The Company's exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a function of currency exchange rates. 


The
estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models using prevailing financial market information as of September 25, 2004 and September 27, 2003. In
certain instances where judgment is required in estimating fair value, price quotes were obtained from several of the Company's counterparty financial institutions. Although the table above reflects
the notional principal, fair value, and credit risk amounts of the Company's foreign exchange instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that
the foreign exchange instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures,
will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. 


Foreign Exchange Risk Management  


The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risk associated with existing assets
and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions and forecasted future cash flows. Generally, the Company's practice is to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction
exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, or limited availability of
appropriate hedging instruments. 


To
protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company's U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenues, and the
Company's non-U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries selling in local currencies hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries' functional currency.
Other comprehensive income associated with hedges of foreign currency revenues is recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related sales are recognized, and other comprehensive
income related to inventory purchases is recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Typically, the Company hedges portions of its forecasted
foreign currency exposure associated with revenues and inventory purchases over a time horizon of 3 to 9 months. 


Derivative
instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be dedesignated as hedges when it is probable that the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period
or within a subsequent 2 month time period. Deferred gains and losses in other comprehensive income associated with such derivative instruments are immediately reclassified into earnings in
other income and expense. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are also reflected in current earnings unless they are redesignated as hedges of other transactions.
During 2004, the Company recorded net losses of $2.8 million in other income and expense related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges due to changes in the
Company's forecast of future net sales and cost of sales and due to prevailing market conditions. No net gains, or losses, of a similar nature were recorded in 2003. During 2002, the Company recorded
net gains of $2.5 million in other income and expense related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges due to changes in the Company's forecast of future net sales and
cost of sales and due to prevailing market conditions. As of September 25, 2004, the Company had a net deferred loss associated with cash flow hedges of approximately $4.4 million, net
of taxes, substantially all of which is expected to be reclassified to earnings by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2005. 


76








 




The
Company may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the translation and economic exposure of a net investment position in a foreign subsidiary. The Company may also enter into
foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities in non-functional
currencies. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in current earnings in other income and expense as offsets to the changes in the fair value of the related assets or
liabilities. Due to market movements, changes in option time value can lead to increased volatility in other income and expense. 


Interest Rate Risk Management  


From time to time, the Company historically entered into interest rate derivative transactions with financial institutions in order to better match the Company's
floating-rate interest income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on any outstanding long-term debt,
and/or to
diversify a portion of the Company's exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. 


In
prior years, the Company had entered into interest rate debt swaps with financial institutions in order to better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on cash equivalents
and short term investments with its fixed rate interest expense on its long term debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the Company's exposure away from fluctuations in short term U.S. interest rates.
The interest rate swaps required the Company to pay a floating interest rate based on the three- or six-month U.S. dollar LIBOR and receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of
the underlying notional amounts. These swaps effectively converted the Company's fixed-rate 10-year debt to floating-rate debt. Due to prevailing market interest
rates, during 2001 and 2002 the Company entered into and then subsequently closed out interest rate debt swap positions realizing gains of $23 million which were deferred over the remaining
life of the debt. 


As
of September 25, 2004 and September 27, 2003, the Company had no interest rate derivatives outstanding. 


Debt  


In February 2004, the Company retired $300 million of debt outstanding in the form of 6.5% unsecured notes. The notes were originally issued in 1994 and were sold
at 99.9925% of par for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. As of September 27, 2003, the carrying amount of these notes, including unamortized deferred gains associated with closed debt
interest rate swaps, was $304 million, respectively, while the fair value was $302 million. The fair value of the notes was based on their listed market values as of September 27,
2003. 


Non-Current Debt and Equity Investments and Related Gains and Losses  


The Company has held significant investments in ARM Holdings plc (ARM), Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai) and EarthLink Network, Inc. (EarthLink). These
investments have been reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as long term assets within other assets and have been categorized as available-for-sale requiring that they
be carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. All realized gains on the sale of these
investments have been included in other income and expense. In fiscal 2004, the Company sold all of its remaining non-current investments in public companies. 


77








 


EarthLink  


In January 2000, the Company invested $200 million in EarthLink, an Internet service provider (ISP). The investment was in EarthLink's Series C Convertible
Preferred Stock, which was convertible by the Company after January 4, 2001, into approximately 7.1 million shares of EarthLink common stock. Concurrent with this investment, EarthLink
and the Company entered into a multi-year agreement to deliver ISP service to Macintosh users in the U.S. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company profits from each new Macintosh
customer that subscribes to EarthLink's ISP service for a specified period of time, and EarthLink is the default ISP in the Company's Internet Setup Software included with all Macintosh computers sold
in the U.S. 


During
the first quarter of 2003, the Company sold 2,580,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds of approximately $13.7 million, an amount that approximated the Company's carrying value
of the shares. During the third quarter of 2003, the Company sold all of its remaining holdings in EarthLink, consisting of 3,960,000 shares of stock for net proceeds of approximately
$23 million, and a gain before taxes of $2 million. 


During
the first quarter of 2002, the Company sold 117,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds of $2 million and a gain before taxes of $223,000. No sales of EarthLink were made in any
of the subsequent quarters of fiscal 2002. However, during the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company determined that the then current decline in the fair value of its investment in EarthLink was
other-than-temporary. As a result, the Company recognized a $44 million charge to earnings to write-down the basis of its investment in EarthLink to
$35 million. This charge was included in gains (losses) on non-current investments, net. As of September 28, 2002, the Company held 6.5 million shares of EarthLink
stock valued at $35 million. 


Akamai  


In June 1999, the Company invested $12.5 million in Akamai, a global Internet content delivery service. The investment was in the form of convertible preferred
stock that converted into 4.1 million shares of Akamai common stock (adjusted for subsequent stock splits) at the time of Akamai's initial public offering in October 1999. Beginning in
the first quarter of 2000, the Company categorized its shares in Akamai as available-for-sale. 


During
2004, the Company sold its remaining 986,000 shares of Akamai stock. The transaction generated proceeds of approximately $5 million and a gain before taxes of approximately
$4 million. 


During
the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company sold 1,875,000 shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of $9 million and a gain before taxes of $8 million. As of September 27,
2003, the Company's remaining investment in Akamai consisted of 986,000 shares of Akamai stock valued at $5 million. 


During
the first quarter of 2002, the Company sold 250,000 shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of $2 million and a gain before taxes of $710,000. No sales of Akamai were made in any of the
subsequent quarters of fiscal 2002. However, during the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company determined the decline in the fair value of its investment in Akamai was
other-than-temporary. As a result, the Company recognized a $6 million charge to earnings to write-down the basis of its investment in Akamai to
$3 million. This charge was included in gains (losses) on non-current investments, net. 


78










 
 


ARM  


ARM is a publicly held company in the U.K. involved in the design and licensing of high performance microprocessors and related technology. 


During
the third quarter of 2003, the Company sold all of its remaining holdings in ARM stock, consisting of 278,000 shares for net proceeds of approximately $295,000, and a gain before taxes of
$270,000. 


During
the first quarter of 2002, the Company sold 4.7 million shares of ARM stock for both net proceeds and a gain before taxes of $21 million. No sales of ARM were made in any of the
subsequent quarters of fiscal 2002. 


Other Strategic Investments  


The Company has made additional minority debt and equity investments in several privately held technology companies, which were reflected in the consolidated balance sheets in
other assets. These investments were inherently risky because the products and/or markets of these companies were typically not fully developed. During 2002, the Company determined the decline in fair
value of certain of these investments was other-than-temporary and, accordingly, recognized a charge to earnings of $15 million. These charges were included in gains
(losses) on non-current investments, net. As of September 25, 2004, the Company had $1.4 million of equity investments reflected in its consolidated balance sheet. As of
September 27, 2003, the Company had no private debt or equity investments reflected in its consolidated balance sheet.

Accumulated
amortization related to goodwill of $55 million arising prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 142 has been reflected in the gross carrying amount of goodwill as
of September 25, 2004 and September 27, 2003. 


During
the third quarter of 2004, the Company recorded an adjustment of approximately $5 million to goodwill related to the acquisition of PowerSchool, Inc (PowerSchool) in fiscal 2001. This
reduction of goodwill included the cancellation of 79,167 shares of Apple common stock, valued at approximately $2 million, that were previously held in escrow and were refunded upon resolution
of certain matters arising out of the acquisition of PowerSchool. This adjustment also included approximately $3 million to adjust the original estimates of the pre-acquisition
PowerSchool restructuring liability to actual costs incurred.

Acquisition of Emagic GmbH  


During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company acquired Emagic GmbH (Emagic), a provider of professional software solutions for computer based music production, for
approximately $30 million in cash; $26 million of which was paid immediately upon closing of the deal and $4 million of which was held-back for future payment
contingent on continued employment by certain employees that would be allocated to future compensation expense in the appropriate periods over the following 3 years. During fiscal 2003,
contingent consideration totaling $1.3 million was paid. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase. The portion of the purchase price allocated to purchased in-process
research and development (IPR&D) was expensed immediately, and the portion of the purchase price allocated to acquired technology and to tradename will be amortized over their estimated useful lives
of 3 years. Goodwill associated with the acquisition of Emagic is not subject to amortization pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 142. Total consideration was allocated as follows (in
millions):

The
amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition, because the technological feasibility of products under development had not been established and no alternative
future uses existed. The IPR&D relates primarily to Emagic's Logic series technology and extensions. At the date of the acquisition, the products under development were between 43%-83%
complete, and it was expected that the remaining work would be completed during the Company's fiscal 2003 at a cost of approximately $415,000. The remaining efforts, which were completed in 2003,
included finalizing user interface design and development, and testing. The fair value of the IPR&D was determined using an income approach, which reflects the projected free cash flows that will be
generated by the IPR&D projects and that are attributable to the acquired technology, and discounting the projected net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 25%. 


Acquisition of certain assets of Zayante, Inc., Prismo Graphics, and Silicon Grail  


During fiscal 2002 the Company acquired certain technology and patent rights of Zayante, Inc., Prismo Graphics, and Silicon Grail Corporation for a total of
$20 million in cash. These transactions have been accounted for as asset acquisitions. The purchase price for these asset acquisitions, except for $1 million identified as contingent
consideration which would be allocated to compensation expense over the following 3 years, has been allocated to acquired technology and would be amortized on a straight-line basis
over 3 years, except for certain assets acquired from Zayante associated with patent royalty streams that would be amortized over 10 years. 


Acquisition of Nothing Real, LLC  


During the second quarter of 2002, the Company acquired certain assets of Nothing Real, LLC (Nothing Real), a privately-held company that develops and markets high
performance tools designed for the digital image creation market. Of the $15 million purchase price, the Company has allocated $7 million to acquired technology, which will be amortized
over its estimated life of 5 years. The remaining $8 million, which has been identified as contingent consideration, rather than recorded as an additional component of 


82








 


the
cost of the acquired assets, would be allocated to future compensation expense in the appropriate periods over the following 3 years. 


Note 5Restructuring Charges  


Fiscal 2004 Restructuring Actions  


The Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $23 million during the year ended September 25, 2004, including approximately $14 million
in severance costs, $5.5 million in asset impairments, and a $3.5 million charge for lease cancellations. Of the $23 million charge, $14.3 million had been spent by the end
of 2004, with the remaining $8.7 million consisting of $5.2 million for employee severance benefits and $3.5 million for lease cancellations. 


During
the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company recognized restructuring expense of $5.5 million. In conjunction with the European workforce reduction during the second quarter of 2004, the
Company vacated a leased sales facility during the fourth quarter of 2004 resulting in a charge of $3.7 million for contract termination and asset impairment costs. The Company also recognized
employee termination costs of $1.8 million related to the elimination of non-essential positions, principally in Europe. In addition, the Company reversed $400,000 of excess
restructuring expense from prior periods related primarily to lower than expected disposal costs on Sacramento manufacturing-related fixed assets. The net cost of the restructuring plans for the
fourth quarter of 2004 was $5.1 million, of which $300,000 had been paid prior to the end of 2004. These actions will result in the termination of 54 positions, 4 of which had been terminated
prior to the end of 2004. 


During
the third quarter of 2004, the Company finalized restructuring plans related to closing Company-owned manufacturing activities in Sacramento. In addition, the Company's management approved
restructuring plans related to certain headcount reductions primarily for various sales and marketing activities principally in the U.S. Total cost of the restructuring plan for the third quarter of
2004 was $7.9 million, of which $7.2 million had been paid prior to the end of 2004. These actions will result in the termination of 83 positions, 77 of which had been terminated prior
to the end of 2004. 


The
closing of manufacturing operations in Sacramento resulted in the elimination of 67 positions for a severance cost of $1.9 million and write-off of $5.3 million in
manufacturing-related fixed assets whose use ceased during the third quarter of 2004. Termination of sales and marketing activities, principally in the U.S., resulted in severance of
$0.7 million for the elimination of 16 positions. 


During
the second quarter of 2004, the Company's management approved restructuring plans related to the termination of Company-owned manufacturing activities in Sacramento and headcount reductions
related primarily to various sales and marketing activities in the U.S. and Europe. Total cost of the actions was $9.6 million for the termination of 348 positions. As of the end of the fourth
quarter of 2004, $6.8 million had been spent and 310 positions had been eliminated related to these actions.

Fiscal 2003 Restructuring Actions  


The Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $26.8 million during the year ended September 27, 2003, including approximately
$7.4 million in severance costs, a $5.0 million charge to write-off deferred compensation, $7.1 million in asset impairments and a $7.3 million charge for lease
cancellations. Of the $26.8 million charge, all had been spent by the end of 2004, except for approximately $3.0 million related to operating lease costs on abandoned facilities. During
the third quarter of 2003, approximately $500,000 of the amount originally accrued for lease cancellations was determined to be in excess due to the sublease of a property sooner than originally
estimated and a shortfall of approximately $500,000 was identified in the severance accrual due to higher than expected severance costs related to the closure of the Company's Singapore manufacturing
operations. These adjustments had no net effect on reported operating expense. 


During
the second quarter of 2003, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions that resulted in recognition of a total restructuring charge of $2.8 million, including
$2.4 million in severance costs and $400,000 for asset write-offs and lease payments on an abandoned facility. Actions taken in the second quarter were for the most part
supplemental to actions initiated in the prior two quarters and focused on further headcount reductions in various sales and marketing functions in the Company's Americas and Europe operating segments
and further reductions associated with PowerSchool-related activities in the Americas operating segment, including an accrual for asset write-offs and lease payments on an abandoned
facility. The second quarter actions resulted in the termination of 93 employees. 


During
the first quarter of 2003, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of $24 million that resulted in the termination of manufacturing
operations at the Company-owned facility in Singapore, further reductions in headcount resulting from the shift in PowerSchool product strategy that took place at the end of fiscal 2002, and
termination of various sales and marketing activities in the U.S. and Europe. These restructuring actions resulted in the elimination of 260 positions worldwide. 


Closure
of the Company's Singapore manufacturing operations resulted in severance costs of $1.8 million and costs of $6.7 million to write-off manufacturing related fixed
assets, whose use ceased during the first quarter. PowerSchool related costs included severance of approximately $550,000 and recognition of $5 million of previously deferred stock compensation
that arose when PowerSchool was acquired by the Company in 2001 related to certain PowerSchool employee stockholders who were terminated in the first quarter of 2003. Termination of sales and
marketing activities and employees, principally in the U.S. and Europe, resulted in severance costs of $2.8 million and accrual of costs associated with operating leases on 


84








 




closed
facilities of $6.7 million. The total net restructuring charge of $23 million recognized during the first quarter of 2003 also reflects the reversal of $600,000 of unused
restructuring accrual originally made during the first quarter of 2002.

Fiscal 2002 Restructuring Actions  


During fiscal 2002, the Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $30 million related to actions intended to eliminate certain activities and better
align the Company's operating expenses with existing general economic conditions and to partially offset the cost of continuing investments in new product development and investments in the Company's
Retail operating segment. 


During
the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of approximately $6 million designed to reduce headcount costs in
corporate operations and sales and to adjust its PowerSchool product strategy. These restructuring actions resulted in the elimination of approximately 180 positions worldwide at a cost of
$1.8 million, all of which were eliminated by September 27, 2003. Eliminated positions were primarily in corporate operations, sales, and PowerSchool related research and development in
the Americas operating segment. The shift in product strategy at PowerSchool included discontinuing development and marketing of PowerSchool's PSE product. This shift resulted in the impairment of
previously capitalized development costs associated with the PSE product in the amount of $4.5 million. 


During
the first quarter of 2002, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of approximately $24 million. These restructuring actions resulted in
the elimination of approximately 425 positions worldwide at a cost of $8 million. Positions were eliminated primarily in the Company's operations, information systems, and administrative
functions. In addition, these restructuring actions also included significant changes in the Company's information systems strategy resulting in termination of equipment leases and cancellation of
existing projects and activities. The Company ceased using the assets associated with first quarter 2002 restructuring actions during that same quarter. Related lease and contract cancellation charges
totaled $12 million, and charges for asset impairments totaled $4 million. The first quarter 2002 restructuring actions were primarily related to corporate activity not allocated to
operating segments. During the first quarter of 2003, the Company reversed the remaining unused accrual of $600,000. All amounts associated with the fiscal 2002 restructuring actions had been spent by
the end of fiscal 2003.

The
foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pretax earnings of approximately $384 million, $250 million and $284 million in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. As
of September 25, 2004, approximately $3.2 billion of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based
in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. The Company's consolidated financial statements
fully provide for any related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated, aside from undistributed earnings of certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be indefinitely
reinvested in operations outside the U.S. U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $972 million of such earnings. It is not practicable to determine the income tax
liability that might be incurred if these earnings were to be distributed. 


Deferred
tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits, and the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts
of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected
to be recovered or settled.

As
of September 25, 2004, the Company had operating loss carryforwards for federal tax purposes of approximately $446 million, which expire from 2011 through 2024. A portion of these
carryforwards was acquired from NeXT and other acquisitions, the utilization of which is subject to certain limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The Company also has Federal credit
carryforwards and various state and foreign tax loss and credit carryforwards, the tax effect of which is approximately $132 million and which expire between 2005 and 2024. The remaining
benefits from tax losses and credits do not expire. As of September 25, 2004, a valuation allowance of $30 million was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax
losses that may not be realized. The valuation allowance relates primarily to the operating loss carryforwards acquired from NeXT and other acquisitions. Management believes it is more likely than not
that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to
fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets.

The
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed its field audit of the Company's federal income tax returns for all years prior to 2001 and proposed certain adjustments. Certain of these
adjustments are being contested through the IRS Appeals Office. Substantially all IRS audit issues for these years have been resolved. In addition, the Company is also subject to audits by state,
local, and foreign tax authorities. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be
predicted with certainty. Should any issues addressed in the Company's tax audits be resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its
provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs. 


Note 7Shareholders' Equity  


Restricted Stock Units  


During fiscal 2004, the Company's Board of Directors approved the grant of 2.515 million restricted stock units to selected members of the Company's senior management,
excluding its Chief Executive Officer (CEO). These restricted stock units generally vest in two equal installments on the second and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant. The Company has recorded
the $64.4 million value of these restricted stock units as a component of shareholders' equity and will amortize that amount on a straight-line basis over the 4 year
requisite service period. The value of the restricted stock units was based on the closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. Quarterly amortization will be approximately
$4.0 million, of which approximately $0.5 million will be included in cost of sales; $1.3 million will be included in research and development expense; and the remaining
$2.2 million will be included in selling, general and administrative expense. The restricted stock units have been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share utilizing the
treasury stock method. 


CEO Restricted Stock Award  


On March 19, 2003, the Company entered into an Option Cancellation and Restricted Stock Award Agreement (the Agreement) with Mr. Steven P. Jobs, its CEO. The
Agreement cancelled stock option 


88








 


awards
for the purchase of 27.5 million shares of the Company's common stock previously granted to Mr. Jobs in 2000 and 2001. Mr. Jobs retained options to purchase 60,000 shares
of the Company's common stock granted in August of 1997 in his capacity as a member of the Company's Board of Directors, prior to becoming the Company's CEO. The Agreement replaced the cancelled
options with a restricted stock award of 5 million shares of the Company's common stock. The restricted stock award generally vests three years from date of grant. Vesting of some or all of the
restricted shares will be accelerated in the event Mr. Jobs is terminated without cause, dies, or has his management role reduced following a change in control of the Company. 


The
Company has recorded the value of the restricted stock award of $74.75 million as a component of shareholders' equity and is amortizing that amount on a straight-line basis over
the 3 year service period. The value of the restricted stock award was based on the closing market price of the Company's common stock of $14.95 on the date of the award. Amortization expense
for this award, which amounts to approximately $6.2 million per quarter, has been included in selling, general, and administrative expense beginning in March 2003 and will continue to be
included through March 2006. The 5 million restricted shares have been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share utilizing the treasury stock method. 


Stock Repurchase Plan  


In July 1999, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does
not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time. 


During
the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company entered into a forward purchase agreement to acquire 1.5 million shares of its common stock in September of 2003 at an average price of $16.64 per
share for a total cost of $25.5 million. In August 2003, the Company settled this agreement prior to its maturity, at which time the Company's common stock had a fair value of $22.81.
Other than this forward purchase transaction, the Company has not engaged in any transactions to repurchase its common stock since fiscal 2000. Since inception of the stock repurchase plan, the
Company had repurchased a total of 6.55 million shares at a cost of $217 million. The Company was authorized to repurchase up to an additional $283 million of its common stock as
of September 25, 2004. 


Preferred Stock  


The Company has 5 million shares of authorized preferred stock, none of which is outstanding. Under the terms of the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation, the
Board of Directors is authorized to determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the Company's authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock. 


Comprehensive Income  


Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under
generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders' equity but are excluded from net income. The Company's other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency
translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as
available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges.

derivative gains (losses) reclassified from other comprehensive income was $(13) million, $(7) million and $8 million for fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. 


Note 8Employee Benefit Plans  


2003 Employee Stock Option Plan  


At the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on April 24, 2003, the shareholders approved an amendment to the 1998 Executive Officer Stock Plan to change the name of the
plan to the 2003 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 2003 Plan), to provide for broad-based grants to all employees in addition to executive officers and other key employees and to prohibit future
"repricings" of employee stock options, including 6-months-plus-1-day option exchange programs, without shareholder approval. Based on the terms of
individual option grants, options granted under the 2003 Plan generally expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on
continued employment, with 


90








 


either
annual or quarterly vesting. The 2003 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, and stock purchase
rights. 


1997 Employee Stock Option Plan  


In August 1997, the Company's Board of Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 1997 Plan), a non-shareholder approved plan for grants of
stock options to employees who are not officers of the Company. Based on the terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 1997 Plan generally expire 7 to 10 years after the
grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment, with either annual or quarterly vesting. As a result of shareholder approval of amendments
to the 1998 Executive Officer Stock Plan in April 2003, the Company terminated the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan and cancelled all remaining unissued shares totaling 14,295,351 following the
completion of an employee stock option exchange program in October 2003. 


Employee Stock Option Exchange Program  


On March 20, 2003, the Company announced a voluntary employee stock option exchange program (the Exchange Program) whereby eligible employees, other than executive
officers and members of the Board of Directors, had an opportunity to exchange outstanding options with exercise prices at or above $25.00 per share for a predetermined smaller number of new stock
options issued with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of one share of the Company's common stock on the day the new awards are issued, which was to be at least six months plus one day
after the exchange options are cancelled. On April 17, 2003, in accordance with the Exchange Program, the Company cancelled options to purchase 16,569,193 shares of its common stock. On
October 22, 2003, new stock options totaling 6,697,368 shares were issued to employees at an exercise price of $22.76 per share, which is equivalent to the closing price of the Company's stock
on that date. No financial or accounting impact to the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flow was associated with this transaction. 


1997 Director Stock Option Plan  


In August 1997, the Company's Board of Directors adopted a shareholder approved Director Stock Option Plan (DSOP) for non-employee directors of the Company.
Initial grants of 30,000 options under the DSOP vest in three equal installments on each of the first through third anniversaries of the date of grant, and subsequent annual grants of 10,000 options
are fully vested at grant. 


Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans  


Certain of the Company's executive officers, including Mr. Timothy D. Cook, Mr. Jonathan Rubinstein, Mr. Bertrand Serlet, and Mr. Avadis Tevanian,
Jr., have entered into trading plans pursuant to Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. A trading plan is a written document that
pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company's stock including the exercise and sale
of employee stock options and shares acquired pursuant to the Company's employee stock purchase plan and upon vesting of restricted stock units. 


Employee Stock Purchase Plan  


The Company has a shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan (the Purchase Plan), under which substantially all employees may purchase common stock through payroll
deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values as of the beginning and end of six month offering periods. Stock purchases under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of an
employee's compensation, up to a maximum 


91








 


of
$25,000 in any calendar year. Beginning with the six-month offering period that started on June 30, 2003, the number of shares authorized for issuance is limited to a total of
1 million shares per offering period. During 2004, 2003, and 2002, 2.0 million, 2.1 million, and 1.8 million, respectively were issued under the Purchase Plan. As of
September 25, 2004, approximately 2 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan. 


Employee Savings Plan  


The Company has an employee savings plan (the Savings Plan) qualifying as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the
Savings Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limit ($13,000 for calendar year 2004). The
Company matches 50% to 100% of each employee's contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employee's earnings. The Company's matching contributions to the Savings Plan
were approximately $24 million, $21 million, and $19 million in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

As
of September 27, 2003, the Company had exercisable options to purchase 38.8 million shares outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $18.75 per share. As of
September 28, 2002, the Company had exercisable options to purchase 57.9 million shares outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $30.85 per share. 


The
Company had 2.515 million restricted stock units outstanding as of September 25, 2004, which were excluded from the options outstanding balances in the preceding tables. None of
these restricted stock units were vested as of September 25, 2004. The grant of these restricted stock units has been deducted from the shares available for grant under the Company's stock
option plans. 


Note 9Stock-Based Compensation  


The
Company has provided pro forma disclosures in Note 1 of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the effect on net income and earnings per share as if the fair value method of
accounting for stock compensation had been used for its employee stock option grants and employee stock purchase plan purchases. These pro forma effects have been estimated at the date of grant and
beginning of the period, respectively, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. 


For
purposes of the pro forma disclosures provided pursuant to SFAS No. 123, the option awards issued in October 2003 and the awards cancelled as part of the Employee Stock Option
Exchange Program have been accounted for using modification accounting. In accordance with SFAS No. 123, the grant date of the awards issued is the date of acceptance of the exchange offer by
participating employees. The cancellation of certain of the Company's CEO's options and replacement with restricted shares in March 2003 is also being accounted for using modification
accounting for purposes of the pro forma disclosures provided pursuant to SFAS No. 123.

For
purposes of the pro forma disclosures provided pursuant to SFAS No. 123, the expected volatility assumptions used by the Company prior to the third quarter of 2003 had been based solely on
the historical volatility of the Company's common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Company's stock options. Beginning in the third quarter of
2003, the Company has modified this approach to consider other relevant factors including implied volatility in market traded options on the Company's common stock and the impact of unusual
fluctuations not reasonably expected to recur on the historical volatility of the Company's common stock. The Company will continue to monitor these and other relevant factors in developing the
expected volatility assumption used to value future awards. 


Beginning
in the third quarter of 2003, the Company shortened its estimate of the expected life of new options granted to its employees from 4 years to 3.5 years. The Company bases its
expected life assumption on its historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock options it grants to employees. The change in the expected life assumption made during the third
quarter of 2003 was the result of the expected impact of shortening the contractual life of new options granted to employees from 10 years to 7 years and changing the vesting provisions
of new options granted to employees from 4 year straight-line annual vesting to 4 year straight-line quarterly vesting. 


Note 10Commitments and Contingencies  


Lease Commitments  


The Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any other
off-balance-sheet financing arrangements. The major facility leases are for terms of 5 to 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of 3 to 5 additional years. Leases
for retail space are for terms of 5 to 16 years and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of September 25, 2004, the Company's total future minimum lease payments
under noncancelable operating leases were $617 million, of which $436 million related to leases for retail space. 


Rent
expense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $103 million, $97 million, and $92 million in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

Accrued Warranty and Indemnifications  


The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period for hardware products is typically one year from the date of
purchase by the end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for Apple service parts used to repair Apple hardware products. The Company provides currently for the
estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product warranties at the time related revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals for product warranty
obligations include the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected
cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company's typical experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting warranty
liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future expectations.

The
Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property
rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim
against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against itself or an
indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a material adverse
effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Therefore, the Company did not record a liability for infringement costs as of either September 25, 2004 or
September 27, 2003.

Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product  


Although most components essential to the Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, other key components (including microprocessors and
application-specific integrated circuits, or ("ASICs")) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some other key components, while currently available to the Company from
multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide availability and pricing pressures. In addition, the Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal
computer industry, and new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for and
subsequently qualifies additional suppliers. If the supply of a key single-sourced component to the Company were to be delayed or curtailed or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays shipments
of completed products to the Company, the Company's ability to ship related products in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely affected. The Company's business and financial
performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an
alternative source. Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to
meet the Company's requirements. Finally, significant portions of the Company's CPUs, logic boards, and assembled products are now manufactured by outsourcing partners, the majority of which occurs in
various parts of Asia. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company's operating
results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production obligations. 


Contingencies  


Beginning on September 27, 2001, three shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the
Company and its Chief Executive Officer. These lawsuits are substantially identical, and purport to bring suit on behalf of persons who purchased the Company's publicly traded common stock between
July 19, 2000, and September 28, 2000. The complaints allege violations of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. The Company
believes these claims are without merit and intends to defend them vigorously. The Company filed a motion to dismiss on June 4, 2002, which was heard by the Court on September 13, 2002.
On December 11, 2002, the Court granted the Company's motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action, with leave to Plaintiffs to amend their complaint within thirty days. Plaintiffs
filed their amended complaint on January 31, 2003, and on March 17, 2003, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The Court heard the Company's motion on
July 11, 2003 and dismissed Plaintiffs' claims with prejudice on August 12, 2003. Plaintiffs have appealed the ruling. 


The
Company is subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully adjudicated. In the opinion of management, the Company
does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity
or results of operations. However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these
legal matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. 


Production
and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers 


96








 




the
ability to return product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been
passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates including various European Union member countries, Japan and certain states within the U.S. Although the Company does not anticipate any
material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company's results of operations and financial position. 


Note 11Segment Information and Geographic Data  


In
accordance with SFAS No. 131, 
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information
, the Company reports segment information
based on the "management" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's
reportable segments. 


The
Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable operating segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas segment includes
both North and South America, except for the activities of the Company's Retail segment. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Japan segment
includes only Japan and excludes revenue from the Company's own retail stores in Japan, which is included in the Company's Retail segment. The Retail segment operated Apple-owned retail stores in the
U.S. and Japan during fiscal 2004. Other operating segments include Asia-Pacific, which includes Australia and Asia except for Japan, and the Company's subsidiary, FileMaker, Inc.
Each reportable geographic operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services, and the accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described
in Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," except as described below for the Retail segment. 


The
Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales. The Retail segment's performance is also evaluated based on operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are
generally based on the location of the customers. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the
segment. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses that are managed outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include
various corporate expenses, manufacturing costs not included in standard costs, income taxes, and various nonrecurring charges. Corporate expenses include research and development, corporate marketing
expenses, and other separately managed general and administrative expenses including certain corporate expenses associated with support of the Retail segment. The Company does not include intercompany
transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. Segment assets exclude corporate assets. Corporate assets include cash, short-term and long-term investments,
manufacturing facilities, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets, and retail store construction-in-progress that is not subject
to depreciation. Except for the Retail segment, capital expenditures for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment. Capital expenditures by the Retail segment were
$104 million, $92 million and $106 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 


Operating
income for all segments, except Retail, includes cost of sales at manufacturing standard cost, other cost of sales, related sales and marketing costs, and certain general and administrative
costs. This measure of operating income, which includes manufacturing profit, provides a comparable basis for comparison between the Company's various geographic segments. Certain manufacturing
expenses and 


97








 




related
adjustments not included in segment cost of sales, including variances between standard and actual manufacturing costs and the mark-up above standard cost for product supplied to
the Retail segment, are included in corporate expenses. 


Management
assesses the operating performance of the Retail segment differently than it assesses the operating performance of the Company's geographic segments. The Retail segment revenue and
operating income is intended to depict a comparable measure to that of the Company's major channel partners in the U.S. operating retail stores so the Company can evaluate the Retail segment
performance as if it were a channel partner. Therefore, the Company makes three significant adjustments to the Retail segment for management reporting purposes that are not included in the results of
the Company's other segments. 


First,
the Retail segment's operating income includes cost of sales for Apple products at an amount normally charged to major channel partners in the U.S. operating retail stores, less the cost of
sales programs and incentives provided to those channel partners and the Company's cost to support those partners. For the years ended September 25, 2004, September 27, 2003, and
September 28, 2002, this resulted in the recognition of additional cost of sales above standard cost by the Retail segment and an offsetting benefit to corporate expenses of approximately
$213 million, $106 million, and $52 million, respectively. 


Second,
the Company's extended warranty, support and service contracts are transferred to the Retail segment at the same cost as that charged to the Company's major retail channel partners in the
U.S., resulting in a comparable measure of revenue and gross margin between the Company's Retail stores and those retail channel partners. The Retail segment recognizes the full amount of revenue and
cost of sales at the time of sale of the Company's extended warranty, support and service contracts. Because the Company has not yet earned the revenue or incurred the costs associated with the sale
of these contracts, an offset to these amounts is recognized in other operating segments' net sales and cost of sales. For the year ended September 25, 2004, this resulted in the recognition of
net sales and cost of sales by the Retail segment, with corresponding offsets in other operating segments, of $54 million and $37 million, respectively. For the year ended
September 27, 2003, the net sales and cost of sales recognized by the Retail segment for sales of extended warranty, support and service contracts were $30 million and
$20 million, respectively. For the year ended September 28, 2002, this resulted in the recognition of net sales and cost of sales by the Retail segment of $8 million and
$6 million, respectively. 


Third,
the Company has opened six high profile stores in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Tokyo, Japan and Osaka, Japan as of September 25, 2004 and has an additional store under
development in London, England, which is expected to open by the end of calendar year 2004. These high profile stores are larger than the Company's typical retail stores and were designed to further
promote brand awareness and provide a venue for certain corporate sales and marketing activities, including corporate briefings. As such, the Company allocates certain operating expenses associated
with these stores to corporate marketing expense to reflect the estimated benefit realized Company-wide. The allocation of these operating costs is based on the excess amount incurred for
a high profile store to that of a more typical Company retail location. Expenses allocated to corporate marketing resulting from the operations of these stores were $16 million,
$6 million and $1 million for the years ended September 25, 2004, September 27, 2003, and September 28, 2002 respectively.

A
large portion of the Company's net sales is derived from its international operations. Also, a majority of the raw materials used in the Company's products is obtained from sources outside of the
U.S., and a majority of the products sold by the Company is assembled internationally in the Company's facility in Cork, Ireland or by third-party vendors in Taiwan, Korea, the Netherlands, the
People's Republic of China, and the Czech Republic. As a result, the Company is subject to risks associated with foreign operations, such as obtaining governmental permits and approvals, currency
exchange fluctuations, currency restrictions, political instability, labor problems, trade restrictions, and changes in tariff and freight charges. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of
net sales in 2004, 2003 or 2002.

Note 12Related Party Transactions and Certain Other Transactions  


In
March 2002, the Company entered into a Reimbursement Agreement with its CEO, Mr. Steven P. Jobs, for the reimbursement of expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs in the operation of his
private plane when used for Apple business. The Reimbursement Agreement became effective for expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs for Apple business purposes since he took delivery of the plane in
May 2001. The Company recognized a total of $483,000, $404,000, and $1,168,000 in expenses pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. All expenses
recognized pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement have been included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. 


In
connection with a relocation assistance package, the Company in May 2000 loaned Mr. Ronald B. Johnson, Senior Vice President, Retail, $1.5 million for the purchase of his
principal residence. The loan was secured by a deed of trust and was due and payable in May 2004. Under the terms of the loan, Mr. Johnson agreed that should he exercise any of his stock
options prior to the due date of the loan, he would pay the Company an amount equal to the lesser of (1) an amount equal to 50% of the total net gain realized from the exercise of the options;
or (2) $375,000 multiplied by the number of years between the exercise date and the date of the loan. Mr. Johnson repaid $750,000 of this loan in fiscal 2003 and repaid the remaining
balance of $750,000 in fiscal 2004. 


Mr. Jerome
York, a member of the Board of Directors of the Company, is a member of an investment group that purchased MicroWarehouse, Inc. (MicroWarehouse) in January 2000. Until
September 7, 2003, he also served as Microwarehouse's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. MicroWarehouse was a reseller of computer hardware, software and peripheral products,
including products made by the 


101








 




Company.
On September 8, 2003, CDW Corporation (CDW), acquired selected North American assets of MicroWarehouse. MicroWarehouse subsequently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the
U.S. MicroWarehouse accounted for approximately 0.3%, 2.4% and 3.3% of the Company's net sales for the years ended September 25, 2004, September 27, 2003, and September 28, 2002,
respectively. Trade receivables from MicroWarehouse were $4.3 million and $9.9 million as of September 25, 2004 and September 27, 2003, respectively. The Company has
provided what it believes to be an adequate allowance on the outstanding receivable based on the Company's secured interest position in selected MicroWarehouse assets and the expected payments to
unsecured creditors. Sales to MicroWarehouse and related trade receivables were generally subject to the same terms and conditions as those with the Company's other resellers. In addition, the Company
has purchased miscellaneous equipment and supplies from MicroWarehouse. Total purchases amounted to approximately $2.3 million and $2.9 million for the years ended September 27,
2003 and September 28, 2002, respectively. No purchases were made by the Company from MicroWarehouse in fiscal 2004.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM    
 


The
Board of Directors and Shareholders

Apple Computer, Inc.: 


We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Computer, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 25, 2004 and September 27, 2003, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 25, 2004. These consolidated
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. 


We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 


In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Apple Computer, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
September 25, 2004 and September 27, 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 25,
2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 


As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for asset retirement obligations and for financial instruments with characteristics
of both liabilities and equity in 2003 and changed its method of accounting for goodwill in 2002.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
Note 1
  
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 
Apple Inc.
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively Apple or the Company) designs, manufactures, and markets personal computers, mobile communication and media devices, and portable digital music players, and sells a variety of
related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications. The Company sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores, and direct sales force, and third-party cellular
network carriers, wholesalers, resellers and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Macintosh (Mac), iPhone, iPad and iPod compatible products including application software, printers, storage
devices, speakers, headphones, and various other accessories and supplies through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise, government and creative customers. 


Basis of Presentation and Preparation 
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these consolidated financial
statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior year amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current years presentation. 


The Companys fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Companys fiscal years
2010, 2009 and 2008 ended on September 25, 2010, September 26, 2009 and September 27, 2008, respectively, and included 52 weeks each. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter approximately every six years to
realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years or quarters refer to the Companys fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters of those fiscal years. 


Retrospective Adoption of New Accounting Principles 
 
In September 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended the accounting standards related to revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables and arrangements
that include software elements (new accounting principles). The new accounting principles permitted prospective or retrospective adoption, and the Company elected retrospective adoption during the first quarter of 2010. 


Under the historical accounting principles, the Company was required to account for sales of both iPhone and Apple TV using subscription
accounting because the Company indicated it might from time-to-time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features for those products free of charge. Under subscription accounting, revenue and associated product cost of sales for iPhone
and Apple TV were deferred at the time of sale and recognized on a straight-line basis over each products estimated economic life. This resulted in the deferral of significant amounts of revenue and cost of sales related to iPhone and Apple
TV. 
 
The new accounting principles affect the Companys accounting for all past and current sales of iPhone, iPad, Apple
TV and for sales of iPod touch beginning in June 2010. The new accounting principles require the Company to account for the sale of these devices as two deliverables. The first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality
of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale, and the second deliverable is the right included with the purchase of these devices to receive on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades and features relating to the
products essential software. The new accounting principles result in the recognition of a substantial portion of the revenue and all product costs from

the sale of these devices at the time of their sale. Additionally, the Company is required to estimate a standalone selling price for the unspecified software upgrade rights included with the
sale of these devices and recognizes that amount ratably over the 24-month estimated life of the related hardware device. 


Refer to the Explanatory Note and Note 2, Retrospective Adoption of New Accounting Principles in the 2009 Form
10-K for additional information on the impact of adoption of the new accounting principles, which sections are incorporated herein by reference. 
 
Revenue Recognition 
 
Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale
of hardware, software, digital content and applications, peripherals, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or
determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Companys product sales, these criteria are met at the time the
product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company legally retains a portion of
the risk of loss on these sales during transit. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products (e.g., Macs, iPhones, iPads, iPods and peripherals), software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the
hardware, and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following
types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware. 


The Company sells software and peripheral products obtained from other companies. The Company generally establishes its own pricing and
retains related inventory risk, is the primary obligor in sales transactions with its customers, and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. Accordingly, the Company generally recognizes revenue for the sale of products obtained
from other companies based on the gross amount billed. For certain sales made through the iTunes Store, including sales of third-party software applications for the Companys iOS devices, the Company is not the primary obligor to users of the
software, and third-party developers determine the selling price of their software. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing only the commission it retains from each sale and including that commission in net sales
in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The portion of the sales price paid by users that is remitted by the Company to third-party developers is not reflected in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations. 


The Company records deferred revenue when it receives payments in advance of the delivery of products or the performance of services.
This includes amounts that have been deferred related to embedded unspecified and specified software upgrades rights. The Company sells gift cards redeemable at its retail and online stores, and also sells gift cards redeemable on the iTunes Store
for the purchase of content and software. The Company records deferred revenue upon the sale of the card, which is relieved upon redemption of the card by the customer. Revenue from AppleCare service and support contracts is deferred and recognized
ratably over the service coverage periods. AppleCare service and support contracts typically include extended phone support, repair services, web-based support resources and diagnostic tools offered under the Companys standard limited
warranty. 
 
The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer
incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. The estimated cost of these programs is recognized in the period the Company has sold the product and committed to a plan. The Company
also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Companys historical experience. Revenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected
taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.

Revenue Recognition for
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables 
 
For multi-element arrangements that include tangible products that contain
software that is essential to the tangible products functionality and undelivered software elements that relate to the tangible products essential software, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative
selling prices. In such circumstances, the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE), (ii) third-party
evidence of selling price (TPE), and (iii) best estimate of the selling price (ESP). VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that
deliverable. ESPs reflect the Companys best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. 
 
As described in more detail below, for all past and current sales of iPhone, iPad, Apple TV and for sales of iPod touch beginning in June 2010, the Company has indicated it may from time-to-time provide
future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers. The Company has identified two deliverables in arrangements involving the sale of these devices. The first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the
functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale. The second deliverable is the embedded right included with the purchase of iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Apple TV to receive on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified
software upgrades and features relating to the products essential software. The Company has allocated revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method. Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for the two
deliverables, the allocation of revenue has been based on the Companys ESPs. Amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue
recognition have been met. Amounts allocated to the embedded unspecified software upgrade rights are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the 24-month estimated life of each of these devices. All product cost of sales, including
estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs for engineering and sales and marketing are expensed as incurred. 
 
The Companys process for determining its ESP for deliverables without VSOE or TPE considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each
deliverable. The Company believes its customers, particularly consumers, would be reluctant to buy unspecified software upgrade rights related to iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Apple TV. This view is primarily based on the fact that unspecified
upgrade rights do not obligate the Company to provide upgrades at a particular time or at all, and do not specify to customers which upgrades or features will be delivered. Therefore, the Company has concluded that if it were to sell upgrade rights
on a standalone basis, including those rights associated with iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Apple TV, the selling price would be relatively low. Key factors considered by the Company in developing the ESPs for these upgrade rights include prices
charged by the Company for similar offerings, the Companys historical pricing practices, the nature of the upgrade rights (e.g., unspecified and when-and-if-available), and the relative ESP of the upgrade rights as compared to the total
selling price of the product. The Company may also consider, when appropriate, the impact of other products and services, including advertising services, on selling price assumptions when developing and reviewing its ESPs for software upgrade rights
and related deliverables. The Company may also consider additional factors as appropriate, including the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist, and product-specific business objectives. 


Beginning in the third quarter of 2010 in conjunction with the announcement of iOS 4, the Companys ESPs for the embedded software
upgrade rights included with iPhone, iPad and iPod touch reflect the positive financial impact expected by the Company as a result of its introduction of a mobile advertising platform for these devices and the expectation of customers regarding
software that includes or supports an advertising component. iOS 4 supports iAd, the Companys new mobile advertising platform, which enables applications on iPhone, iPad and iPod touch to embed media-rich advertisements. 


For all periods presented, the Companys ESP for the embedded software upgrade right included with each Apple TV sold is $10. The
Companys ESP for the software upgrade right included with each iPhone sold through the 


 
 
52 






Table of Contents



Companys second quarter of 2010 was $25. Beginning in April 2010 in conjunction with the Companys announcement of iOS 4 for iPhone, the Company lowered its ESP for the software
upgrade right included with each iPhone to $10. 
 
Beginning with initial sales of iPad in April 2010, the Company has also
indicated it may from time-to-time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to iPad customers. The Companys ESP for the embedded software upgrade right included with the sale of each iPad is $10. In June 2010,
the Company announced that certain previously sold iPod touch models would receive an upgrade to iOS 4 free of charge and indicated iPod touch devices running on iOS 4 may from time-to-time receive future unspecified software upgrades and features
free of charge. The Companys ESP for the embedded software upgrade right included with each iPod touch sold beginning in June 2010 is $5. 
 
The Company accounts for multiple element arrangements that consist only of software or software-related products, including the sale of upgrades to previously sold software, in accordance with industry
specific accounting guidance for software and software-related transactions. For such transactions, revenue on arrangements that include multiple elements is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element, and fair value
is determined by VSOE. If the Company cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in such multiple-element arrangements, the Company defers revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been
performed, or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements. When the fair value of a delivered element has not been established, but fair value exists for the undelivered elements, the Company uses the
residual method to recognize revenue. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue. 


Except as described for iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Apple TV, the Company generally does not offer unspecified upgrade rights to its
customers in connection with software sales or the sale of AppleCare extended warranty and support contracts. A limited number of the Companys software products are available with maintenance agreements that grant customers rights to
unspecified future upgrades over the maintenance term on a when and if available basis. Revenue associated with such maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term. 
 
Shipping Costs 
 
For all periods presented, amounts billed to customers
related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue, and the Companys shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales. 


Warranty Expense 
 
The
Company generally provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. The Company assesses the adequacy of its pre-existing warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary
based on actual experience and changes in future estimates. 
 
Software Development Costs 


Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed
are subject to capitalization beginning when a products technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. In most instances, the Companys products are released soon
after technological feasibility has been established. Therefore, costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally most software development costs have been expensed as incurred.

 
The Company did not capitalize any software development costs during 2010. In 2009 and 2008, the Company capitalized $71
million and $11 million, respectively, of costs associated with the development of Mac OS X 


 
 
53 






Table of Contents



Version 10.6 Snow Leopard (Mac OS X Snow Leopard), which was released during the fourth quarter of 2009. The capitalized costs are being amortized to cost of sales on a straight-line
basis over a three year estimated useful life of the underlying technology.
 
Total amortization related to capitalized software
development costs was $48 million, $25 million and $27 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 
 
Advertising Costs 


Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $691 million, $501 million and $486 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively. 
 
Stock-Based Compensation 
 
The Company accounts for stock-based payment transactions in which the Company receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are
based on the fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. Stock-based compensation cost for restricted stock units (RSUs) is measured based on the closing fair
market value of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation cost for stock options is estimated at the grant date based on each options fair-value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM)
option-pricing model. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation cost as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company will recognize a benefit from stock-based compensation in equity if an incremental
tax benefit is realized by following the ordering provisions of the tax law. In addition, the Company accounts for the indirect effects of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit, the foreign tax credit and the domestic manufacturing
deduction through the income statement. Further information regarding stock-based compensation can be found in Note 7, Shareholders Equity and Stock-Based Compensation of this Form 10-K. 


Income Taxes 
 
The
provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax
bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax
assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. 


The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be
sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50%
likelihood of being realized upon settlement. See Note 6, Income Taxes of this Form 10-K for additional information. 
 
Earnings
Per Common Share 
 
Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the
weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued.

Table of Contents



Potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options, shares to be purchased under the employee stock purchase plan and unvested RSUs. The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive
securities is reflected in diluted earnings per common share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the Companys common stock can result in a greater dilutive
effect from potentially dilutive securities. 
 
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per
common share for the three years ended September 25, 2010 (in thousands, except net income in millions and per share amounts):

Potentially dilutive
securities representing 1.6 million, 12.6 million and 10.3 million shares of common stock for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share for these periods because their
effect would have been antidilutive. 
 
Financial Instruments 
 
Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities 
 
All highly liquid investments
with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. The Companys debt and marketable equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. Management determines the
appropriate classification of its investments in debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates the available-for-sale designations as of each balance sheet date. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or
long-term based on each instruments underlying contractual maturity date. Marketable securities with maturities of less than 12 months are classified as short-term and marketable securities with maturities greater than 12 months are classified
as long-term. These securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of shareholders equity. The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method.

 
Derivative Financial Instruments 
 
The Company accounts for its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value. Derivatives that are not defined as hedges must be adjusted to fair value through
earnings. 
 
For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated
as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or
periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in current earnings. To receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly
effective in offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. For
derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that are designated as fair value hedges, the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the
hedged item attributable to 


 
 
55 






Table of Contents



the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current period. The Company did not have a net gain or loss on these derivative instruments during 2010, 2009 and 2008. The net gain or loss on
the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure of the net investment in a foreign operation is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation
adjustment. For forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses
related to this component are recognized in current earnings. 
 
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 


The Company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. The Company considers historical
experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of the Companys customers, current economic conditions, and other factors that may affect customers ability to pay. 


Inventories 
 
Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out method, or market. If the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. The
Companys inventories consist primarily of components and finished goods for all periods presented. 
 
Property, Plant and Equipment

 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, up to five years for equipment, and the shorter of lease terms or ten years for leasehold improvements. The Company
capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $815 million, $606 million and $387 million during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 


Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets 
 
The Company reviews property, plant and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property,
plant and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. The Company did not record any
significant impairments during 2010, 2009 and 2008. 
 
The Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives, rather such assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. The Company performs its goodwill and intangible
asset impairment tests on or about August 31 of each year. The Company did not recognize any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in 2010, 2009 and 2008. The Company established reporting units based on its current reporting
structure. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit. 
 
The Company amortizes its intangible assets with definite lives over their estimated useful lives and reviews these assets for impairment. The Company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible
assets with definite lives over periods ranging from three to ten years.

Fair Value Measurements

 
During 2009, the Company adopted the FASBs new accounting standard on fair value measurements and disclosures for
all financial assets and liabilities. The new accounting principles define fair value, provide a framework for measuring fair value, and expand the disclosures required for fair value measurements. During the first quarter of 2010, the Company
adopted the new fair value accounting principles for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, which did not have a
material effect on the Companys financial condition or operating results. 
 
The Company applies fair value accounting for
all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from
selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value,
the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk,
transfer restrictions and credit risk. In accordance with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company has not elected the fair value option
for any eligible financial instruments. 
 
Foreign Currency Translation and Remeasurement 


The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange
rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are credited or charged to foreign
currency translation included in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity. The Companys subsidiaries that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates
in effect at the end of each period, and inventories, property, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. Gains and losses from these remeasurements were insignificant and have been included in the Companys results of
operations. 
 
Segment Information 
 
The Company reports segment information based on the management approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing
performance as the source of the Companys reportable segments. Information about the Companys products, major customers and geographic areas on a company-wide basis is also disclosed. 


Business Combinations 


In December 2007, the FASB issued a new accounting standard for business combinations, which established principles and requirements for
how an acquirer is to recognize and measure in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree in a business combination. This new accounting standard also
established principles regarding how goodwill acquired in a business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase should be recognized and measured, requiring the capitalization of in-process research and development at fair value and the expensing
of acquisition-related costs as incurred, as well as providing guidelines on the disclosure requirements. In April 2009, the FASB amended this new accounting standard to require that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination
that arise from contingencies be recognized at fair value, if the fair value can be determined during the measurement period. The Company adopted the new business combination accounting standard in the first quarter of 2010 and applied these
principles to any business combinations completed in or after the first quarter of 2010. The adoption of the new business combination accounting standard did not have a material effect on the Companys financial condition or operating results.

The Company had net unrealized gains on its investment portfolio of $180 million and $57 million as of
September 25, 2010 and September 26, 2009, respectively. The net unrealized gains as of September 25, 2010 and September 26, 2009 related primarily to long-term marketable securities. The Company may sell certain of its
marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. The Company recognized no significant net realized gains or losses during 2010, 2009 and 2008 related
to such sales. The maturities of the Companys long-term marketable securities generally range from one year to five years
.

The Company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be
temporary in nature. The unrealized losses on the Companys marketable securities were caused primarily by changes in market interest rates or widening credit spreads. The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its policy
generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Companys investment policy requires investments to be investment grade, primarily rated single-A or better, with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal
loss. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating the investments for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value
has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the Companys intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell, the investment before recovery of the
investments amortized cost basis. During the years ended September 25, 2010 and September 26, 2009, the Company did not recognize any significant impairment charges. As of September 25, 2010, the Company does not consider any of
its investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired. 
 
Derivative Financial Instruments 


The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. The Company may enter into
foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset some of the foreign exchange risk of expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales, of net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and on certain existing
assets and liabilities. To help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Companys subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar, hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency
revenue. The Companys subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar and who sell in local currencies, may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries functional currencies. The
Company typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases for three to six months. To help protect the net investment in a foreign operation from adverse changes in foreign currency
exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company may also enter into
foreign currency forward and option contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. However, the Company may
choose not to hedge certain foreign currency exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to immateriality, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no
assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange rates.

The Companys
accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. The Company records all derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The effective portions of cash
flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment.
Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments and the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges and net investment hedges are adjusted to fair value through earnings in other income and expense. 


The Company had a net deferred loss associated with cash flow hedges of approximately $252 million and a net deferred gain of $1 million,
net of taxes, recorded in other comprehensive income as of September 25, 2010 and September 26, 2009, respectively. Other comprehensive income associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue is recognized as a component of net
sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and other comprehensive income related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases is recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized.
Substantially all of the Companys hedged transactions as of September 25, 2010 are expected to occur within six months. 
 
Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within
a subsequent two month time period. Deferred gains and losses in other comprehensive income associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified immediately into earnings through other income and expense. Any subsequent changes in fair value
of such derivative instruments also are reflected in current earnings unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. The Company did not recognize any significant net gains or losses related to the loss of hedge designation on
discontinued cash flow hedges during 2010, 2009 and 2008. 
 
The Company had an unrealized net loss on net investment hedges of
$9 million and $2 million, net of taxes, included in the cumulative translation adjustment account of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) as of September 25, 2010 and September 26, 2009, respectively. The ineffective
portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness test of net investment hedges are recorded in current earnings in other income and expense. 
 
The Company recognized in earnings a net loss of $123 million and $133 million on foreign currency forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments during the year ended
September 25, 2010 and September 26, 2009, respectively. These amounts represent the net gain or loss on the derivative contracts and do not include changes in the related exposures, which generally offset a portion of the gain or loss on
the derivative contracts.

The notional
principal amounts for derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding and does not represent the amount of the Companys exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts represent the Companys
gross exposure to potential accounting loss on these transactions if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency exchange rates at each respective date. The Companys gross
exposure on these transactions may be further mitigated by

collateral received from certain counterparties. The Companys exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a function of currency exchange rates. Although the table above
reflects the notional principal and credit risk amounts of the Companys foreign exchange instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the foreign exchange instruments are intended to
hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. 


The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with
the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuate from
contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values. As of September 25, 2010, the Company has posted cash collateral related to the derivative instruments
under its collateral security arrangements of $445 million and recorded the offsetting balance as other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company did not record any significant amounts of cash collateral related to the derivative
instruments under its master netting arrangements as of September 26, 2009. The Company did not have any derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features that would require it to post additional collateral as of
September 25, 2010 or September 26, 2009. 
 
The estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used
pricing models and prevailing financial market information as of September 25, 2010. Refer to Note 3, Fair Value Measurements of this Form 10-K, for additional information on the fair value measurements for all financial assets and
liabilities, including derivative assets and derivative liabilities, that are measured at fair value in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis. The following tables show the Companys derivative instruments measured at gross

Accounts Receivable 


Trade Receivables 
 
The
Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers and directly to certain education, consumer and enterprise customers. The Company generally does not require collateral
from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in
Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Australia, or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such,
the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables not covered by collateral, third-party financing arrangements, or credit insurance are
outstanding with the Companys third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. Trade receivables from two of the Companys customers accounted for 15% and 12% of trade receivables as of
September 25, 2010 and one of the Companys customers accounted for 16% of trade receivables as of September 26, 2009. The Companys cellular network carriers accounted for 64% and 51% of trade receivables as of
September 25, 2010 and as of September 26, 2009, respectively. The additions and write-offs to the Companys allowance for doubtful accounts during 2010, 2009 and 2008 were not significant. 


Vendor Non-Trade Receivables 
 
The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final
products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. Vendor non-trade receivables from two of the Companys vendors accounted for 57% and 24%, respectively, of non-trade receivables as of September 25,
2010 and two of the Companys vendors accounted for 40% and 36%, respectively, of non-trade receivables as of September 26, 2009. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in net sales and does not recognize any profits on
these sales until the related products are sold by the Company, at which time any profit is recognized as a reduction of cost of sales.

Note 3  Fair Value
Measurements 
 
The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer
a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal
or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and credit risk.

 
The Company applies the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three
levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement: 
 
Level 1 
 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
 
Level 2 
 Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets,
or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 
 
Level 3 
 Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect managements estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

 
The Companys valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity
securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of all other financial instruments, all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings,
were valued based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. 
 
Assets/Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

The foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pretax earnings of $13.0 billion, $6.6 billion
and $4.6 billion in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Companys consolidated financial statements provide for any related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated, aside from undistributed earnings of certain of the Companys
foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the U.S. As of September 25, 2010, U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $12.3 billion of such earnings. The amount of
unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these temporary differences is estimated to be approximately $4.0 billion. 
 
As
of September 25, 2010 and September 26, 2009, $30.8 billion and $17.4 billion, respectively, of the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S.
dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. 
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits, and the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

The Companys
income taxes payable have been reduced by the tax benefits from employee stock plan awards. For stock options, the Company receives an income tax benefit calculated as the difference between the fair market value of the stock issued at the time of
the exercise and the option price, tax effected. For RSUs, the Company receives an income tax benefit upon the awards vesting equal to the tax effect of the underlying stocks fair market value. The Company had net excess tax
benefits from employee stock plan awards of $742 million, $246 million and $770 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, which were reflected as increases to common stock. 
 
Uncertain Tax Positions 
 
Tax positions are evaluated in a two-step process.
The Company first determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination. If a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold it is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to
recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company classifies gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax
benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
As of September 25, 2010, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $943 million, of which $404 million, if recognized, would affect the Companys effective tax rate. As of
September 26, 2009, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $971 million, of which $307 million, if recognized, would affect the Companys effective tax rate.

The Company includes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for
income taxes. As of September 25, 2010 and September 26, 2009, the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $247 million and $291 million, respectively, which is classified as non-current liabilities in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. In 2010 and 2009, the Company recognized an interest benefit of $43 million and interest expense of $64 million, respectively, in connection with tax matters. 
 
The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, all years prior to 2004
are closed. The Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) has completed its field audit of the Companys federal income tax returns for the years 2004 through 2006 and proposed certain adjustments. The Company has contested certain of
these adjustments through the IRS Appeals Office. The IRS is currently examining the years 2007 through 2009. During the third quarter of 2010, the Company reached a tax settlement with the IRS for the years 2002 through 2003. In connection with the
settlement, the Company reduced its gross unrecognized tax benefits by $100 million and recognized a $52 million tax benefit in the third quarter of 2010. In addition, the Company is also subject to audits by state, local and foreign tax
authorities. In major states and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 1988 and 2001, respectively, generally remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities. 


Management believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the
outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Companys tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for
income tax in the period such resolution occurs. Although timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits would materially change in the next
12 months. 
 
Note 7  Shareholders Equity and Stock-Based Compensation 


Preferred Stock 
 
The
Company has five million shares of authorized preferred stock, none of which is issued or outstanding. Under the terms of the Companys Restated Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors is authorized to determine or alter the rights,
preferences, privileges and restrictions of the Companys authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock. 
 
Comprehensive Income

 
Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income
refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under GAAP are recorded as an element of shareholders equity but are excluded from net income. The Companys other comprehensive income consists

Employee Benefit Plans 


2003 Employee Stock Plan 


The 2003 Employee Stock Plan (the 2003 Plan) is a shareholder approved plan that provides for broad-based equity grants to
employees, including executive officers. The 2003 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, stock purchase rights and performance-based awards. Options granted under the 2003
Plan generally expire seven to ten years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based on continued employment, with either annual, semi-annual or quarterly vesting. In general, RSUs granted under the 2003
Plan vest over two to four years, are subject to the employees continued employment and are paid upon vesting in shares of the Companys common stock on a one-for-one basis. At the Companys 2010 annual meeting of shareholders, the
2003 Plan was amended to (i) increase the number of shares of the Companys common stock that may be delivered pursuant to awards granted under the 2003 Plan by an additional 36,000,000 shares and (ii) extend the Companys
authority to grant awards under the 2003 Plan intended to qualify as performance-based awards within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code through the 2015 annual meeting of shareholders. As of
September 25, 2010, approximately 62.5 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2003 Plan.

1997 Employee Stock Option Plan

 
In August 1997, the Companys Board of Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 1997
Plan), a non-shareholder approved plan for grants of stock options to employees who are not officers of the Company. Options granted under the 1997 Plan generally expire seven to ten years after the grant date. All stock options granted under
the 1997 Plan are fully vested. In October 2003, the Company terminated the 1997 Plan, and no new options can be granted from this plan. 


1997 Director Stock Plan 


In August 1997, the Companys Board of Directors (the Board) adopted a Director Stock Option Plan, which was
subsequently renamed the 1997 Director Stock Plan (the Director Plan) and has been approved by shareholders. As amended, the Director Plan (i) permits the Company to grant awards of RSUs or stock options to the Companys
non-employee directors, (ii) beginning February 25, 2010, provides for automatic initial grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the Board and automatic annual grants of RSUs at each annual meeting of shareholders, and
(iii) permits the Board to prospectively change the relative mixture of stock options and RSUs for the initial and annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the Companys common stock subject to these
grants without shareholder approval. Each share issued with respect to RSUs granted under the plan reduces the number of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares. The Director Plan expires November 9, 2019. As of September 25,
2010, approximately 199,000 shares were reserved for future issuance under the Director Plan. 
 
Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans 


During the fourth quarter of 2010, executive officers Timothy D. Cook, Peter Oppenheimer, D. Bruce Sewell, Philip W. Schiller and Bertrand
Serlet had trading plans pursuant to Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). A trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for
determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Companys stock including the exercise and sale of employee stock options and shares acquired pursuant to the Companys employee stock purchase plan and upon
vesting of RSUs. 
 
Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
 
The Company has a shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan (the Purchase Plan), under which substantially all employees may purchase the Companys common stock through payroll
deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values of the stock as of the beginning and end of six-month offering periods. An employees payroll deductions under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of the employees
compensation and employees may not purchase more than $25,000 of stock for any calendar year. Additionally, no more than 1,000,000 shares may be purchased in the aggregate in any one offering period. As of September 25, 2010,
approximately 3.8 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan. 
 
Employee Savings Plan 


The Company has an employee savings plan (the Savings Plan) qualifying as a deferred salary arrangement under
Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the Savings Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the IRS annual contribution limit ($16,500 for calendar year 2010). The Company matches 50%
to 100% of each employees contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employees eligible earnings. The Companys matching contributions to the Savings Plan were $72 million, $59 million and $50 million
in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The fair value as of the vesting date of RSUs was $1 billion, $221 million and $320 million for
2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Upon vesting, the RSUs are generally net share-settled to cover the required withholding tax and the remaining amount is converted into an equivalent number of shares of common stock. The majority of RSUs that
vested in 2010, 2009 and 2008, were net-share settled such that the Company withheld shares with value equivalent to the employees minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the
appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 1.8 million, 707,000 and 857,000 for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their vesting date as determined by the
Companys closing stock price. Total payments for the employees tax obligations to the taxing authorities were $406 million, $82 million and $124 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity
within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These net-share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the Company as they reduced and retired the number of shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting
and did not represent an expense to the Company.

Aggregate intrinsic
value represents the value of the Companys closing stock price on the last trading day of the fiscal period in excess of the weighted-average exercise price multiplied by the number of options outstanding or exercisable. The aggregate
intrinsic value excludes the effect of stock options that have a zero or negative intrinsic value. Total intrinsic value of options at time of exercise was $2.0 billion, $827 million and $2.0 billion for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

 
RSUs granted are deducted from the shares available for grant under the Companys stock option plans utilizing a factor
of two times the number of RSUs granted. Similarly, RSUs cancelled are added back to the shares available for grant under the Companys stock option plans utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs cancelled. Outstanding RSU balances
are not included in the outstanding options balances in the stock option activity table.

Stock-Based Compensation

 
Stock-based compensation cost for RSUs is measured based on the closing fair market value of the Companys common
stock on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation cost for stock options and employee stock purchase plan rights (stock purchase rights) is estimated at the grant date and offering date, respectively, based on the fair-value as
calculated by the BSM option-pricing model. The BSM option-pricing model incorporates various assumptions including expected volatility, expected life and interest rates. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the
Companys common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Companys stock options and other relevant factors including implied volatility in market traded options on the Companys common
stock. The Company bases its expected life assumption on its historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards it grants to employees. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation cost as expense ratably on a straight-line
basis over the requisite service period. 
 
The weighted-average assumptions used for stock options granted do not apply to
employee stock options assumed in conjunction with business acquisitions during the year ended September 25, 2010. The weighted-average fair value of stock options assumed during the year ended September 25, 2010 was $216.82. There were no
stock options assumed during 2009 and 2008. The weighted-average assumptions used for the three years ended September 25, 2010, and the resulting estimates of weighted-average fair value per share of options granted and of stock purchase rights
during those periods are as follows:

Stock-based compensation expense capitalized as software development costs was not significant as of
September 25, 2010 or September 26, 2009. The income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation expense was $314 million, $266 million and $169 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The total unrecognized compensation cost
related to stock options and RSUs expected to vest was $1.9 billion as of September 25, 2010, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.73 years. 
 
Note 8  Commitments and Contingencies 
 
Lease Commitments 


The Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company
does not currently utilize any other off-balance sheet financing arrangements. The

Table of Contents



major facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms not exceeding five additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms
ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are for ten years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of September 25, 2010, the Companys total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were
$2.1 billion, of which $1.7 billion related to leases for retail space. 
 
Rent expense under all operating leases, including
both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $271 million, $231 million and $207 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of one year as of
September 25, 2010, are as follows (in millions):

Accrued Warranty and Indemnifications 
 
The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period for hardware products is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. The
Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the Companys hardware products. The Company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product warranties at the time
related revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical and projected warranty claim rates,
historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Companys typical experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its pre-existing warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as
necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates. 
 
The Company periodically provides updates to its
applications and system software to maintain the softwares compliance with published specifications. The estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for as warranty costs that are recognized at the time related software revenue is
recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units delivered, the number of updates expected to occur, and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary
to develop these updates. 
 
The following table reconciles changes in the Companys accrued warranty and related costs for
the three years ended September 25, 2010 (in millions):

The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against
legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by 


 
 
76 






Table of Contents



the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an
indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a
potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results. Therefore, the Company did not record a liability for infringement costs as
of either September 25, 2010 or September 26, 2009. 
 
The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with
its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to
advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited
history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. However, the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations, and payments made
under these agreements historically have not materially adversely affected the Companys financial condition or operating results. 


Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product 


Although most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components
including but not limited to microprocessors, enclosures, certain liquid crystal displays (LCDs), certain optical drives and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are currently obtained by the Company from single
or limited sources, which subjects the Company to significant supply and pricing risks. Many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources including but not limited to NAND flash memory, dynamic random access memory
(DRAM) and certain LCDs, are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. In addition, the Company has entered into certain agreements for the supply of key components including but not
limited to microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs at favorable pricing, but there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar favorable terms, or at all, upon expiration or otherwise obtain
favorable pricing in the future. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and/or price increases that can materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. 


The Company and other participants in the personal computer, and mobile communication and media device industries also compete for
various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. In addition, the Company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries, and new products introduced by the Company
often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the
Companys supply of a key single-sourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, if such components were available only at significantly higher prices, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed
products to the Company, the Companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Companys business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to
obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided
to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements. 


Substantially all of the Companys Macs, iPhones, iPads, iPods, logic boards and other assembled products are now manufactured by
outsourcing partners, primarily in various parts of Asia. A significant concentration of this outsourced manufacturing is currently performed by only a few outsourcing partners of the Company, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing
partners are the sole-sourced supplier of components and manufacturing outsourcing for many of the Companys key products including but not limited to final assembly 


 
 
77 






Table of Contents



of substantially all of the Companys Macs, iPhones, iPads and iPods. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Companys
operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The Companys purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. 


Long-Term Supply Agreements 
 
The Company has entered into prepaid long-term supply agreements to secure the supply of certain inventory components, which generally expire between 2011 and 2015. As of September 25, 2010, the
Company had a total of $956 million of inventory component prepayments outstanding, of which $157 million is classified as other current assets and $799 million is classified as other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In August 2010, the
Company entered into a long-term supply agreement under which it has committed to prepay $500 million in 2011. The Company had a total of $1.2 billion of inventory component prepayments outstanding as of September 26, 2009. These prepayments
will be applied to certain inventory component purchases made over the life of each respective agreement. 
 
Contingencies 


The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully
adjudicated, which are discussed in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading Legal Proceedings. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and
claims that would individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results. However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. If the Company failed to prevail in any of
these legal matters or if several of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. 


On March 14, 2008, 
Mirror Worlds, LLC 
filed an action against the Company alleging that certain of its products infringed on
three patents covering technology used to display files. On October 1, 2010, a jury returned a verdict against the Company, and awarded damages of $208 million per patent for each of the three patents asserted. The Company is challenging
the verdict, believes it has valid defenses and has not recorded a loss contingency at this time. 
 
Production and marketing of
products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental, product safety and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life,
and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including various countries within Europe and Asia and
certain states and provinces within North America. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws
or future laws will not materially adversely affect the Companys financial condition or operating results. 
 
Note 9
 

Segment Information and Geographic Data 
 
The Company reports segment information based on the management
approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Companys reportable segments. 


The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. Accordingly, the Company determined its operating and reporting
segments, which are generally based on the nature and location of its customers, to be the Americas, Europe, Japan, Asia-Pacific and Retail operations. The Americas, Europe, Japan and Asia-Pacific reportable segment results do not include results of
the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries, as well as the Middle East and 


 
 
78 






Table of Contents



Africa. The Asia-Pacific segment includes Australia and Asia, but does not include Japan. The Retail segment operates Apple retail stores in 11 countries, including the U.S. Each reportable
operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. 


The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic
segments are generally based on the location of customers, while Retail segment net sales are based on sales from the Companys retail stores. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and
operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain
expenses managed outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses, such as manufacturing costs and variances not included in standard costs, research and development, corporate marketing
expenses, stock-based compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges, and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting
purposes. Segment assets exclude corporate assets, such as cash, short-term and long-term investments, manufacturing and corporate facilities, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets. Except for the
Retail segment, capital asset purchases for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment. Cash payments for capital asset purchases by the Retail segment were $392 million, $369 million and $389 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively. 
 
The Company has certain retail stores that have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to
promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Companys more typical retail
stores. The Company allocates certain operating expenses associated with its high-profile stores to corporate marketing expense to reflect the estimated Company-wide benefit. The allocation of these operating costs to corporate expense is based on
the amount incurred for a high-profile store in excess of that incurred by a more typical Company retail location. The Company had opened a total of 15 high-profile stores as of September 25, 2010. Amounts allocated to corporate expense
resulting from the operations of high-profile stores were $75 million, $65 million and $53 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Report of Ernst & Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 


The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Apple Inc. 
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September 25, 2010 and September 26, 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders equity and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Apple Inc. at September 25, 2010 and September 26, 2009, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Apple Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of September 25, 2010, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control  Integrated Framework
 issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated October 27, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of
Ernst & Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Apple Inc.

 
We have audited Apple Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of September 25, 2010, based on criteria
established in 
Internal Control  Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Apple Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 


We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
A companys
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 


Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 


In our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
September 25, 2010, based on the COSO criteria. 
 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the 2010 consolidated financial statements of Apple Inc. and our report dated October 27, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


Nature of Operations 

Apple Computer (the "Company") designs, manufactures, and markets 
microprocessor-based personal computers and related personal computing 
products for sale primarily to education, home, business, and government 
customers.

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple 
Computer, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company).  Intercompany 
accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  The Company's fiscal 
year-end is the last Friday in September.

Accounting Estimates

General
The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity 
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to 
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these 
consolidated  financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results 
could differ materially from those estimates.

Significant Accounting Estimates
Reserves Against Inventories
The Company's reserves against inventories are based on the Company's 
best estimates of product sales prices and customer demand patterns, 
and/or its plans to transition its products.  However, the Company 
participates in a highly competitive industry that is characterized by 
aggressive pricing practices, downward pressures on gross margins, 
frequent introductions of new products, short product life cycles, rapid 
technological advances, continual improvement in product 
price/performance characteristics, and price sensitivity and changing 
demand patterns on the part of consumers.  As a result of the industry's 
ever-changing and dynamic nature, it is at least reasonably possible that 
the estimates used by the Company to determine its reserves against 
inventories will be materially different from the actual amounts or results.  
These differences could result in materially higher than expected inventory 
reserve costs, which could have a materially adverse effect on the 
Company's results of operations and financial condition in the near term.

Warranty and Related Accruals
The Company's warranty and related accruals are based on the Company's 
best estimates of product failure rates and unit costs to repair.  However, 
the Company is continually releasing new and ever-more complex and 
technologically advanced products.  As a result, it is at least reasonably 
possible that product could be released with certain unknown quality 
and/or design problems.  Such an occurrence could result in materially 
higher than expected warranty and related costs, which could have a 
materially adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and 
financial condition in the near term.

Deferred Tax Assets
Realization of approximately $85 million of the total deferred tax assets is 
dependent on the Company's ability to generate approximately $245 
million of future U.S. taxable income.  Management believes that it is 
more likely than not that the asset will be realized based on forecasted U.S. 
income.   However, there can be no assurance that the Company will meet 
its expectations of future U.S. income.  As a result, the amount of the 
deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in the near and 
long term if estimates of future taxable U.S. income are reduced.  Such an 
occurrence could materially adversely affect the Company's results of 
operations and financial condition.  The Company will continue to 
evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing 
the need for a valuation allowance.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Financial Instruments 
Investments
All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the 
date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents; investments with 
maturities between three and twelve months are considered to be short-
term investments.  There are no investments with maturities greater than 
twelve months.  The Company's cash equivalents consist primarily of U.S. 
Government securities, Euro-dollar deposits, and commercial paper.  
Short-term investments consist principally of Euro-dollar deposits and 
commercial paper.  The Company's cash equivalents and short-term 
investments are generally held until maturity.  The Company's marketable 
equity securities consist of securities issued by U.S. corporations and are 
included in "Other assets" on the accompanying balance sheets. 

Management determines the appropriate classification of its debt and 
marketable equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such 
designation as of each balance sheet date.  The Company's debt and 
marketable equity securities have been classified and accounted for as 
available-for-sale.  These securities are carried at fair value, with the 
unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of 
shareholders' equity.  These unrealized gains or losses include any 
unrealized losses and gains on interest rate contracts accounted for as 
hedges against the available-for-sale securities.  Equity securities that are 
not considered marketable as defined are carried at cost.  Realized gains 
and losses on the sale of securities are included in interest and other 
income (expense), net.  The cost of securities sold is based on the specific 
identification method. 

Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk
In the ordinary course of business and as part of the Company's asset and 
liability management, the Company enters into various types of 
transactions that involve contracts and financial instruments with off-
balance-sheet risk.  These instruments are entered into in order to manage 
financial market risk, primarily interest rate and foreign exchange risk.  
The Company enters into these financial instruments with major 
international financial institutions utilizing over-the-counter as opposed to 
exchange traded instruments.  The Company does not hold or transact in 
financial instruments for purposes other than risk management. 

Gains and losses on accounting hedges of existing assets or liabilities are 
recorded currently in income or shareholder's equity against the losses and 
gains on the hedged transactions.  Gains and losses related to qualifying 
accounting hedges of firmly committed or probable but not firmly 
committed transactions are deferred until the occurrence of the hedged 
transactions.  Gains and losses on interest rate and foreign exchange 
contracts that do not qualify as accounting hedges are recorded currently in 
income.

The Company monitors its interest rate and foreign exchange positions 
daily based on applicable and commonly used pricing models.  The 
correlation between the changes in the fair value of hedging instruments 
and the changes in the underlying hedged items is assessed periodically 
over the life of the hedged instrument.  In the event that it is determined 
that a hedge is ineffective, the Company recognizes in income the change 
in market value of the instrument beginning on the date it was no longer an 
effective hedge.  

Interest Rate Derivatives
The Company enters into interest rate derivative transactions, including 
interest rate swaps, collars, and floors, with financial institutions in order
to better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its cash 
equivalents and short-term investments with the fixed-rate interest expense 
of its long-term debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the Company's 
exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates.   The 
Company may also enter into interest rate contracts that are intended to 
reduce the cost of the interest rate risk management program.

In addition, the Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to 
hedge certain intercompany loan transactions.  These forward contracts 
effectively change certain foreign currency denominated debt into U.S. 
dollar denominated debt, which better matches against the Company's U.S. 
dollar denominated cash equivalents and short-term investments. 

				31




Foreign Currency Instruments
The Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts 
with financial institutions primarily to protect against currency exchange 
risks associated with certain firmly committed and certain other probable 
but not firmly committed transactions.  The Company's foreign exchange 
risk management policy requires it to hedge a majority of its existing 
material foreign exchange transaction exposures.  However, the Company 
may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures that are 
immaterial either in terms of their minimal U.S. dollar value or in terms of 
their historically high correlation with the U.S. dollar.   

Probable but not firmly committed transactions comprise sales of the 
Company's products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.  A majority of 
these non-U.S. dollar-based sales are made through the Company's 
subsidiaries in Europe, Asia (particularly Japan), Canada, and Australia.  
The Company also purchases foreign exchange option contracts to hedge 
certain other probable but not firmly committed transactions.  The 
Company also sells foreign exchange option contracts, in order to partially 
finance the purchase of foreign exchange option contracts used to hedge 
both firmly committed and certain other probable but not firmly committed 
transactions.  In addition, the Company enters into other foreign exchange 
transactions, which are intended to reduce the costs associated with its 
foreign exchange risk management programs.  The duration of foreign 
exchange hedging instruments, whether for firmly committed transactions 
or for probable but not firmly committed transactions, currently does not 
exceed one year.

For further information regarding the Company's accounting treatment of 
its financial instruments, refer to pages 33 - 36 of the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. If
the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are made 
currently for the difference between the cost and the market value.

Property, Plant, and Equipment
Property, plant, and equipment is stated at cost.  Depreciation and 
amortization is computed by use of the declining balance and straight-line 
methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets.

Long-Lived Assets
Effective September 30, 1995, the Company adopted Financial Accounting 
Standard No. 121 ("FAS 121"), "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-
Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of."  In 
accordance with FAS 121, prior period financial statements have not been 
restated to reflect this change in accounting principle and the cumulative 
effect of this change was not material. 

Stock-Based Compensation
The Company has not elected early adoption of Financial Accounting 
Standard No. 123 ("FAS 123"), "Accounting for Stock-Based 
Compensation."  FAS 123 becomes effective for the Company in 1997, 
and will have no impact on the Company's results of operations and 
financial condition as the Company has elected to continue measuring 
compensation expense for its stock-based employee compensation plans 
using the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25, 
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees."  However, the Company will 
provide pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if 
the fair value-based method prescribed by FAS 123 had been applied in 
measuring compensation expense.

Foreign Currency Translation  
The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its foreign sales 
subsidiaries at year-end exchange rates.  Gains and losses from these 
translations are credited or charged to "accumulated translation 
adjustment" included in shareholders' equity.  The foreign manufacturing 
and certain other entities use the U.S. dollar as the functional currency and 
translate monetary assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates, and 
inventories, property, and non-monetary assets and liabilities at historical  
rates.  Gains and losses from these translations are included in the results 
of operations and are immaterial.  

				32




Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue at the time products are shipped.  
Provisions are made currently for estimated product returns and price 
protection that may occur under Company programs.  Historically, actual 
amounts recorded for product returns and price protection have not varied 
significantly from estimated amounts. 

Warranty Expense
The Company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be 
incurred under product warranties when products are shipped.

Advertising Costs 
Advertising costs are charged to expense the first time the advertising 
takes place. 

Earnings (Loss) per Share
Earnings (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average number 
of common shares outstanding and (in 1995 and 1994 only) the dilutive 
effect of common stock options using the treasury stock method.  Common 
stock options, the convertible subordinated notes, and certain common 
shares issued pending shareholder approval were not included in the 
computation of loss per share in 1996 as their effect was antidilutive.
 
Reclassifications
Certain prior year amounts in the Industry Segment and Geographic 
Information footnote have been reclassified to conform to the current 
year's presentation.

The gross realized gains recorded to earnings on sales of available-for-sale 
securities, as well as the related cash proceeds from those sales, were $15 
million and $1 million in 1996 and 1995, respectively.  There were no 
gross realized losses recorded to earnings on sales of available-for-sale 
securities in 1996 or 1995.

The Company's cash and cash equivalent balance at September 27, 1996, 
includes $177 million pledged primarily as collateral to support letters of 
credit, and at September 29, 1995, includes $90 million pledged as 
collateral to support notes payable to banks.

Interest Rate Derivatives and Foreign Currency Instruments
The table on page 35 shows the notional principal, fair value, and credit 
risk amounts of the Company's interest rate derivative and foreign 
currency instruments as of September 27, 1996, and September 29, 1995.  
The notional principal amounts for off-balance-sheet instruments provide 
one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of year end, and do 
not represent the amount of the Company's exposure to credit or market 
loss.  The credit risk amount shown in the table below represents the 
Company's gross exposure to potential accounting loss on these 
transactions if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of
the contract, based on then-current currency exchange and interest rates at 
each respective date.  The Company's exposure to credit loss and market 
risk will vary over time as a function of interest rates and currency 
exchange rates. 

The estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used 
pricing models using prevailing financial market information as of 
September 27, 1996, and September 29, 1995.  In certain instances where 
judgment is required in estimating fair value, price quotes were obtained 
from several of the Company's counterparty financial institutions.  
Although the table below reflects the notional principal, fair value, and 
credit risk amounts of the Company's interest rate and foreign exchange 
instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the 
exposures and transactions that the interest rate and foreign exchange 
instruments are intended to hedge.  The amounts ultimately realized upon 
settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses 
on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions 
during the remaining life of the instruments.

The interest rate swaps generally require the Company to pay a floating 
interest rate based on the three- or six-month U.S. dollar LIBOR and 
receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of the underlying 
notional amounts.  As a result, these swaps effectively convert the 
Company's fixed-rate ten-year debt to floating-rate debt and generally 
qualify for hedge accounting treatment.  Maturity dates for these swaps 
currently range from one to seven years.  At September 27, 1996, and 
September 29, 1995, interest rate swaps classified as receive-fixed swaps 
had weighted average receive rates of  6.04% and 5.89%, respectively.  
Weighted average pay rates on these swaps were 5.82% and 5.88% at 
September 27, 1996, and September 29, 1995, respectively.  The 
unrealized gains and losses on these swaps are generally deferred and 
recognized in income in the same period as the hedged transaction.  
Deferred losses on such contracts totaled approximately $13 million and 
$9 million at September 27, 1996, and September 29, 1995, respectively.

Interest rate collars limit the Company's exposure to fluctuations in short-
term interest rates by locking in a range of interest rates. An interest rate
collar is a no-cost structure that consists of a purchased option and a sold
option. The Company receives a payment when the three-month LIBOR 
falls below predetermined levels, and makes a payment when the three-
month LIBOR rises above predetermined levels. The entire structure 
generally qualifies as an accounting hedge.  Purchased floors limit the 
Company's exposure to falling interest rates on its cash equivalents and 
short-term investments by locking in a minimum interest rate.  The 
Company receives a payment when interest rates fall below a 
predetermined level.  A purchased floor generally qualifies for hedge 
accounting treatment and is reported on the balance sheet at its premium 
cost, which is amortized over the life of the floor.  The interest rate collars
and purchased floors are generally designated and effective as hedges 
against interest rate risk on the Company's debt securities classified as 
available-for-sale and are carried at fair value as an adjustment to the basis
of the underlying security.  The related unrealized gains and losses,net of 
taxes, are reported as a component of shareholders' equity and are 
recognized in income in the same period as the hedged transaction.  
Unrealized gains and losses on such contracts were immaterial at 
September 27, 1996, and September 29, 1995.

Interest rate option contracts require the Company to make payments 
should certain interest rates either fall below or rise above predetermined 
levels.  These contracts are generally not accounted for as hedges and are 
carried at fair value with gains and losses recorded currently in income as a 
component of interest and other income (expense), net.

The foreign exchange forward contracts not accounted for as hedges are 
carried at fair value with gains and losses recorded currently in income as a 
component of interest and other income (expense), net.  The foreign 
exchange forward contracts that are designated and effective as hedges are 
also carried at fair value with gains and losses recorded currently in 
income as a component of interest and other income (expense), net, against 
the losses and gains on the hedged transactions.  All foreign exchange 
forward contracts expire within one year.

The premium costs of purchased foreign exchange option contracts that are 
designated and effective as hedges are amortized over the life of the 
option.  If the option contract is designated and effective as a hedge of a 
firmly committed transaction, or a probable but not firmly committed 
transaction, then any gain or loss is deferred until the occurrence of the 
hedged transaction.  Deferred gains and losses on such contracts were 
immaterial at September 27, 1996, and September 29, 1995.  If the option 
contract is used to hedge an asset or liability, then the hedge is carried at
fair value with gains or losses recorded currently in income as a 
component of interest and other income (expense), net, against the losses 
or gains on the hedged transaction.  As of September 27, 1996, maturity 
dates for purchased foreign exchange option contracts ranged from one to 
twelve months.

The purchased and sold foreign exchange option contracts not accounted 
for as hedges are carried at fair value with gains and losses recorded 
currently in income as a component of interest and other income 
(expense), net.  As of September 27, 1996, maturity dates for sold option 
contracts ranged from one to six months.

The Company monitors its interest rate and foreign exchange positions 
daily based on applicable and commonly used pricing models.  The 
correlation between the changes in the fair value of hedging instruments 
and the changes in the underlying hedged items is assessed periodically 
over the life of the hedged instrument.  In the event that it is determined 
that a hedge is ineffective, the Company recognizes in income the change 
in market value of the instrument beginning on the date it was no longer an 
effective hedge.  

Notes Payable to Banks

The weighted average interest rates for Japanese yen-denominated notes 
payable to banks at September 27, 1996, and September 29, 1995, were 
approximately 1.3% and 2.2%, respectively.  The Company had no U.S. 
dollar-denominated notes payable to banks at September 27, 1996.  The 
weighted average interest rate for U.S. dollar-denominated notes payable 
to banks at September 29, 1995, was approximately 6.2%.

The carrying amount of notes payable to banks approximates their fair 
value due to their short-term maturities.

Long-Term Debt
During 1996, the Company issued $661 million aggregate principal 
amount of 6% unsecured convertible subordinated notes (the "Notes") to 
certain qualified parties in a private placement.  The Notes were sold at 
100% of par.  The Notes pay interest semi-annually and mature on June 1, 
2001.  The Notes are convertible by their holders at any time after 
September 5, 1996 at a conversion price of $29.205 per share subject to 
adjustments as defined in the Note agreement.  The Notes are redeemable 
by the Company at 102.4% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest, 
for the twelve-month period beginning June 1, 1999, and at 101.2% of the 
principal amount, plus accrued interest, for the twelve-month period 
beginning June 1, 2000.  The Notes are subordinated to all present and 
future senior indebtedness of the Company as defined in the Note 
agreement.  In addition, the Company incurred approximately $15 million 
of costs associated with the issuance of the Notes.  These costs are 
accounted for as a deduction from the face amount of the Notes and are 
being amortized over the life of the Notes.  In October 1996, the Company 
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission $569 million of 
the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, including the related common 
shares issuable upon conversion of these Notes.

During 1994, the Company issued $300 million aggregate principal 
amount of 6.5% unsecured notes in a public offering registered with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission.  The notes were sold at 99.925% of 
par, for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%.  The notes pay interest 
semi-annually and mature on February 15, 2004.   

The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company's long-
term debt are as follows:

subordinated notes is based on estimates from several financial 
institutions.

Concentrations of Risk

Concentrations of Credit Risk

The Company distributes its products principally through third-party 
computer resellers and various education and consumer channels.  
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited 
because of flooring arrangements for selected customers with third-party 
financing companies and because the Company's customer base consists of 
large numbers of geographically diverse customers dispersed across 
several industries.  As such, the Company generally does not require 
collateral from its customers.  

The counterparties to the agreements relating to the Company's 
investments and foreign exchange and interest rate instruments consist of a 
number of major international financial institutions.  To date, no such 
counterparty has failed to meet its financial obligations to the Company.  
The Company does not believe that there is significant risk of 
nonperformance by these counterparties because the Company continually 
monitors its positions and the credit ratings of such counterparties, and 
limits the financial exposure and the number of agreements and contracts it 
enters into with any one party.  The Company generally does not require 
collateral from counterparties, except for margin agreements associated 
with the ten-year interest rate swaps on the Company's ten-year unsecured 
notes.  To mitigate the credit risk associated with these ten-year swap 
transactions, the Company entered into margining agreements with its 
third-party bank counterparties.  Margining under these agreements does 
not start until 1997.  Furthermore, these agreements would require the 
Company or the counterparty to post margin only if certain credit risk 
thresholds were exceeded.

Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product

Although certain components essential to the Company's business are 
generally available from multiple sources, other key components 
(including microprocessors and application-specific integrated circuits, or 
"ASICs") are currently obtained by the Company from single sources.  If 
the supply of a key single-sourced component to the Company were to be 
delayed or curtailed, the Company's ability to ship the related product 
utilizing such component in desired quantities and in a timely manner 
could be adversely affected, depending on the time required to obtain 
sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain 
sufficient quantities from an alternate source.  In addition, the Company 
uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal 
computer industry.  Continued availability of these components may be 
affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of 
common components instead of components customized to meet the 
Company's requirements.  Finally, a significant portion of the Company's 
CPUs and logic boards are now manufactured by SCI Systems, Inc. 
("SCI").  Although the Company works closely with SCI on manufacturing 
schedules and levels, the Company's operating results could be adversely 
affected if SCI were unable to meet its production obligations.

Significant Customers

No customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company's net sales in 
1996, 1995, or 1994.
 
Advertising Costs

Advertising expense was $183 million, $205 million, and $158 million for 
1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively.

Restructuring of Operations

In the second quarter of 1996, the Company announced and began to 
implement a restructuring plan aimed at reducing costs and restoring 
profitability to the Company's operations.  The restructuring plan was 
necessitated by decreased demand for Company products and the 
Company's adoption of a new strategic direction.  The Company's 
restructuring actions consist primarily of terminating approximately 1,500 
full-time employees (down from an initial planned termination of 
approximately 2,800), approximately 900 of whom have been terminated 
through September 27, 1996, excluding employees who were hired by SCI 
Systems, Inc. and MCI Systemhouse, the purchasers of the Company's 
Fountain, Colorado, manufacturing facility and the Napa, California, data 
center facility, respectively);canceling or vacating certain facility leases as
a result of these employee terminations; writing down certain land, 
buildings and equipment to be sold as a result of downsizing operations 
and outsourcing various operational functions; and canceling contracts as a 
result of terminating eWorld, Apple's on-line service.  These actions 
resulted in an initial charge of $207 million.  The charge was adjusted 
downward by $28 million in the fourth quarter of 1996, primarily as a 
result of greater than expected voluntary terminations, which led to fewer 
than planned involuntary terminations, as well as lower than expected 
costs to cancel or vacate certain facility leases, partially offset by greater
than expected costs to cancel certain contracts and to write down certain
operating assets sold or to be sold.  The restructuring actions have resulted
in cash expenditures of $55 million and noncash asset write-downs of $7 
million through September 27, 1996.  The Company expects that the 
remaining $117 million accrued balance at September 27, 1996, will result 
in cash expenditures of approximately $60 million over the next twelve 
months and approximately $10 million thereafter.  The Company expects 
that most of the contemplated restructuring actions will be completed 
within the next six months and will be financed through current working 
capital and continued short-term borrowings.  

The following table depicts the restructuring activity through September 
27, 1996:	

(In millions)

In the third quarter of 1993, the Company initiated a plan to restructure its
operations worldwide in order to address the competitive conditions in the 
personal computer industry.  In connection with this plan, the Company 
recorded a $321 million charge to operating expenses.  In 1995 and 1994, 
the Company lowered its estimate of the total costs associated with this 
restructuring and recorded an adjustment that increased income by $23 
million and $127 million, respectively.  These adjustments primarily 
reflected the modification or cancelation of certain elements of the 
Company's original restructuring plan because of changing business and 
economic conditions that made certain elements of the restructuring plan 
financially less attractive than originally anticipated.  In addition, some 
actions were completed at a lower cost than originally estimated.

Income Taxes			
			
The provision (benefit) for income taxes consists of
the following:						(In millions)



			
			
				 1996		 1995		 1994

 
 
 

Federal:			
Current				$(125)   	$  26		$  61

				   (2)		   95		   83
			
Provision (benefit) for
income taxes			$(479)     	$ 250   	$ 190


			
The foreign provision (benefit) for income taxes is based on foreign pretax 
earnings (loss) of approximately $(141) million, $572 million, and $474 
million in 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively.  A substantial portion of the 
Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments is held by 
foreign subsidiaries and is generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated 
holdings.  Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries would be subject to U.S. 
income taxation on repatriation to the United States.  The Company's 
financial statements fully provide for any related tax liability on amounts 
that may be repatriated, aside from undistributed earnings of certain of the 
Company's foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be indefinitely 
reinvested in operations outside the United States.  U.S. income taxes have 
not been provided on a cumulative total of $395 million of such earnings.  
It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that might be 
incurred if these earnings were to be distributed.  Except for such 
indefinitely reinvested earnings, the Company provides for federal and 
state income taxes currently on undistributed earnings of foreign 
subsidiaries. 


				40



Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the future income tax effects of
temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of 
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are 
measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years 
in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or 
settled.   

At September 27, 1996, and September 29, 1995, the significant 
components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities were:
							     (In millions)




				September 27, 1996	September 29, 1995

Total deferred tax liabilities		 478			  675
		
Net deferred tax asset (liability)	$  9  			$(435)


		

At September 27, 1996, the Company had operating loss carryforwards for 
tax purposes of approximately $273 million, which expire principally in 
2011.  Substantially all of the remaining benefits from tax losses and 
credits do not expire.  

The net change in the total valuation allowance was negligible in 1996 and 
an increase of $3 million in 1995.   

A reconciliation of the provision (benefit) for income taxes, with the 
amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate  (35% 
in 1996, 1995, and 1994) to income (loss) before provision (benefit) for 
income taxes, is as follows:

The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has proposed federal income tax 
deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company has made 
certain prepayments thereon.  The Company contested the proposed 
deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1988, and most of the issues in 
dispute for these years have been resolved.  On June 29, 1995, the IRS 
issued a notice of deficiency proposing increases to the amount of the 
Company's federal income taxes for the years 1989 through 1991.  The 
Company has filed a petition with the United States Tax Court to contest 
these alleged tax deficiencies.  Management believes that adequate 
provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from these 
tax examinations.

Common Stock

Shareholder Rights Plan

In May 1989, the Company adopted a shareholder rights plan and 
distributed a dividend of one right to purchase one share of common stock 
(a "Right") for each outstanding share of common stock of the Company.  
The Rights become exercisable in certain limited circumstances involving 
a potential business combination transaction of the Company and are 
initially exercisable at a price of $200 per share.  Following certain other 
events after the Rights have become exercisable, each Right entitles its 
holder to purchase for $200 an amount of common stock of the Company, 
or, in certain circumstances, securities of the acquiror, having a then-
current market value of two times the exercise price of the Right. The 
Rights are redeemable and may be amended at the Company's option 
before they become exercisable.  Until a Right is exercised, the holder of a 
Right, as such, has no rights as a shareholder of the Company.  The Rights 
expire on April 19, 1999.

Stock Option Plans

The Company has in effect a 1990 Stock Option Plan (the "1990 Plan").  
The 1981 Stock Option Plan terminated in October 1990 and the 1987 
Executive Long Term Stock Option Plan (the "1987 Plan") terminated in 
July 1995.  Options granted before those plan termination dates remain 
outstanding in accordance with their terms.  Options may be granted under 
the 1990 Plan to employees, including officers and directors who are 
employees, at not less than the fair market value on the date of grant.  
These options generally become exercisable over a period of three years, 
based on continued employment, and generally expire ten years after the 
grant date.  The 1990 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, 
nonstatutory stock options, and stock appreciation rights.

In December 1996, the Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the 
1990 Plan to increase the number of shares reserved for issuance by 1 
million, subject to shareholder approval at the Company's Annual Meeting 
of Shareholders scheduled for February 1997.  In July 1995, the Board of 
Directors adopted an amendment to the 1990 Plan to increase the number 
of shares reserved for issuance by 8.6 million.  In December 1995, the 
Board of Directors adopted a new amendment to reduce this increase to 4.2 
million shares.  This new amendment was approved by the Company's 
shareholders in January 1996.  Also in July 1995, the Board of Directors 
resolved to terminate the 1987 Plan and transfer all unused shares 
remaining under the 1987 Plan to the 1990 Plan.  This resolution was 
approved by the Company's shareholders in January 1996.

In March 1996, the Board of Directors approved the issuance of options to 
purchase 1 million shares of common stock to the Chief Executive Officer 
of the Company, subject to shareholder approval at the Company's Annual 
Meeting of Shareholders scheduled for February 1997.  These options will 
have an exercise price of $26.25 per share and will become exercisable 
over five years.  As the issuance of these options is pending shareholder 
approval, they are not included as outstanding in the table below. 

On May 14, 1996, the Board of Directors adopted a resolution allowing 
employees up to and including the level of Vice President to exchange 
1.25 options at their existing option price for 1.0 new options having an 
exercise price of $26.375 per share, the fair market value of the Company's 
common stock at May 29, 1996.  Options received under this program are 
subject to one year of additional vesting such that the new vesting date for 
each vesting portion will be the later of May 29, 1997, and the original 
vesting date plus one year.  Approximately 2.9 million options were 
exchanged under this program.

Summarized information regarding the Company's stock option plans as of 
September 27, 1996, is as follows:

				     (In thousands, except per share amounts)




					Number of Shares	Price per Share

Restricted Stock Plan

On April 1, 1993, the Company's Board of Directors approved a Restricted 
Stock Plan for officers of the Company (the "RSP"), which became 
effective July 1, 1993.  The RSP was subsequently ratified by the 
shareholders on January 26, 1994.  The RSP is designed to provide an 
incentive for officers to continue to own shares of the Company's common 
stock acquired upon exercise of options under any of the Company's stock 
option plans, thus more closely aligning officers' financial interests with 
those of the shareholders.  The RSP provides that officers who exercise 
stock options and continue to hold the exercised shares for at least three 
years will receive up to three awards of shares of restricted stock.  Each 
such award is for one-third the number of shares held for the requisite 
retention period.  Each restricted stock award granted pursuant to the plan 
becomes fully vested three years after the grant date, provided that the 
officer maintains continuous employment with the Company and that other 
vesting requirements are met.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Company has an employee stock purchase plan (the "Purchase Plan") 
under which substantially all employees may purchase common stock 
through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair 
market values as of the beginning and end of the offering period.  Stock 
purchases under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of an employee's 
compensation, up to a maximum of $25,000 in any calendar year.  As of 
September 27, 1996, approximately 400,000 shares were reserved for 
future issuance under the Purchase Plan.  In December 1996, the Board of 
Directors adopted an amendment to the Purchase Plan to increase the 
number of shares reserved for issuance by 3.5 million, subject to 
shareholder approval at the Company's Annual Meeting of Shareholders 
scheduled for February 1997.  In July 1995, the Board of Directors 
adopted an amendment to the Purchase Plan to increase the number of 
shares reserved for issuance by 3 million.  In December 1995, the Board of 
Directors adopted a new amendment to reduce this increase to 1.5 million 
shares.  This new amendment was approved by the Company's 
shareholders in January 1996.

Chief Executive Officer Performance Shares

In February of 1996, the Board of Directors approved the issuance of up to 
1 million shares of common stock (the "Performance Shares") to the Chief 
Executive Officer of the Company, subject to shareholder approval at the 
Company's Annual Meeting of Shareholders scheduled for February 1997.  
The Company may issue up to 200,000 Performance Shares for each full 
fiscal year during the five-year term of the Chief Executive Officer's 
employment agreement, which began on February 2, 1996. For each partial 
fiscal year during the term of this agreement, the number of shares that 
may be issued shall be prorated to reflect that partial year.  The issuance of
the Performance Shares is subject to the achievement of certain 
performance goals established by the Board of Directors at the beginning 
of the employment agreement and at the beginning of each subsequent 
fiscal year during the term of the employment agreement.  As these 
Performance Shares are pending shareholder approval, they are not 
included as outstanding on the accompanying balance sheet.  However, the 
related estimated compensation expense is included in the 1996 results of 
operations and is immaterial.  The Performance Shares for years after 1996 
will become part of the Senior Officers Restricted Performance Share Plan 
(refer to discussion below) upon approval of the Senior Officers Restricted 
Performance Share Plan by the Company's shareholders at the Annual 
Meeting of Shareholders scheduled for February 1997.

				43



Senior Officers Restricted Performance Share Plan

In December 1996, the Company's Board of Directors approved a Senior 
Officers Restricted Performance Share Plan (the "Performance Share 
Plan") for which officers of the Company at the level of Senior Vice 
President and above, and other key employees as recommended by 
management and designated by the Compensation Committee of the 
Board, will be eligible.  The Performance Share Plan provides for a grant 
of shares to each eligible participant, with annual vesting conditioned on 
the achievement of performance goals established in advance by the 
Compensation Committee and subject to such other terms as may be 
determined by the Committee.  The Performance Share Plan is intended to 
provide an incentive for superior performance, to promote the maintenance 
of substantial stock ownership levels by officers of the Corporation, and to 
enable the Corporation to attract and retain highly qualified executive 
officers.  The Company's Board of Directors has reserved 2 million shares 
for issuance under the provisions of the Performance Share Plan.  The 
Performance Share Plan is subject to shareholder approval at the Annual 
Meeting of Shareholders scheduled for February 1997.

Stock Repurchase Programs

In November 1992, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 
10 million shares of the Company's common stock in the open market.    
Approximately 6.6 million shares remain authorized for repurchase.  No 
shares were repurchased under this authorization in 1996, 1995, or 1994.

Employee Savings Plan

The Company has an employee savings plan (the "Savings Plan") that 
qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the 
Internal Revenue Code.  Under the Savings Plan, participating U.S. 
employees may defer a portion of their pretax earnings, up to the Internal 
Revenue Service annual contribution limit ($9,500 for calendar year 1996).  
Effective October 1, 1995, the Company matches 50% to 100% of each 
employee's contributions, depending on length of service, up to a 
maximum 6% of the employee's earnings.  Prior to October 1, 1995, the 
Company matched 30% to 70% of each employee's contributions, 
depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employee's 
earnings.  The Company's matching contributions to the Savings Plan were 
approximately $22 million, $15 million, and $11 million in 1996, 1995, 
and 1994,  respectively. 

Commitments and Contingencies

Lease Commitments

The Company leases various facilities and equipment under noncancelable 
operating lease arrangements.  The major facilities leases are for terms of 
five to ten years and generally provide renewal options for terms of up to 
five additional years.  Rent expense under all operating leases was 
approximately $129 million, $127 million, and $122 million  in 1996, 
1995, and 1994, respectively.  Future minimum lease payments under 
these noncancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of 
one year as of September 27, 1996, are as follows:

Later years			  25
Total minimum lease payments	$188  


Purchase Commitment

In connection with the sale of its Fountain, Colorado, manufacturing 
facility to SCI Systems, Inc. ("SCI"), the Company is obligated to purchase 
certain percentages of its total annual volumes of CPUs and logic boards 
from SCI over each of the next three years.   The Company has met these 
obligations through September 27, 1996, and believes it will meet them in 
the future.

Litigation

Abraham and Evelyn Kostick Trust v. Peter Crisp  et al.
In January 1996, a purported shareholder class action was filed in the 
California Superior Court for Santa Clara County naming the Company 
and its directors as defendants. The complaint sought injunctive relief and 
damages and alleged that acts of mismanagement resulted in a depressed 
price for the Company. In February 1996, the complaint was amended to 
add a former  director as a defendant and to add purported class and 
derivative claims based on theories such as breach of fiduciary duty, 
misrepresentation, and insider trading. In July 1996, the Court sustained 
defendants' demurrer and dismissed the amended complaint on a variety of 
grounds and granted plaintiffs leave to amend the complaint. In October 
1996, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint naming the 
Company's directors and certain former directors as defendants and again 
alleging purported class and derivative claims, seeking injunctive relief 
and damages (compensatory and punitive) based on theories such as 
breach of fiduciary duty, misrepresentation, and insider trading. In 
November 1996, the Company filed a demurrer seeking dismissal of the 
second amended complaint.

Derek Pritchard v. Michael Spindler et al.
In March 1996, a purported shareholder class action was filed in the 
California Superior Court for Santa Clara County naming certain current 
and former directors of the Company as defendants. The complaint sought 
damages and alleged that the defendants breached their fiduciary duty by 
allegedly rejecting an offer from a computer company (not named in the 
complaint) to acquire the Company at a price in excess of $50 per share. In
August 1996, the Court sustained defendants' demurrer and dismissed the 
complaint on a variety of grounds, and granted plaintiff leave to amend the 
complaint. In October 1996, the plaintiff filed his first amended complaint 
in which he asserted the same purported cause of action as the original 
complaint, alleged additional facts purportedly in support thereof, and 
added the Company as a defendant. The Company intends to file a 
demurrer seeking dismissal of the first amended complaint. 

LS Men's Clothing Defined Benefit Pension Fund v. Michael Spindler et al.
In May 1996, an action was filed in the California Superior Court for 
Alameda County naming as defendants the Company and certain of its 
current and former officers and directors. The complaint seeks 
compensatory and punitive damages and generally alleges that the 
defendants misrepresented or omitted material facts about the Company's 
operations and financial results, which plaintiff contends artificially 
inflated the price of the Company's stock. The case has been transferred to 
the California Superior Court for Santa Clara County. None of the 
defendants has yet responded to the complaint.  

"Repetitive Stress Injury" Litigation
The Company is named in numerous lawsuits (fewer than 100) alleging 
that the plaintiff incurred so-called "repetitive stress injury" to the upper
extremities as a result of using keyboards and/or mouse input devices sold 
by the Company. On October 4, 1996, in a trial of one of these cases 
(Dorsey v. Apple) in the United States District Court for the Eastern 
District of New York, the jury rendered a verdict in favor of the Company, 
and final judgement in favor of the Company has been entered. The other 
cases are in various stages of pretrial activity. These suits are similar to 
those filed against other major suppliers of personal computers. Ultimate 
resolution of the litigation against the Company may depend on progress in 
resolving this type of litigation in the industry overall. 
				45



Monitor-Size Litigation
In August 1995, the Company was named, along with 41 other entities, 
including computer manufacturers and computer monitor vendors, in a 
putative nationwide class action filed in the California Superior Court for 
Orange County, styled Keith Long et al. v. AAmazing Technologies Corp. 
et al.  The complaint alleges that each of the defendants engaged in false or 
misleading advertising with respect to the size of computer monitor 
screens. Also in August 1995, the Company was named as the sole 
defendant in a purported class action alleging similar claims filed in the 
New Jersey Superior Court for Camden County, entitled Mahendri Shah v. 
Apple Computer, Inc. Subsequently, in November 1995, the Company, 
along with 26 other entities, was named in a purported class action alleging 
similar claims filed in the New Jersey Superior Court for Essex County, 
entitled Maizes & Maizes v. Apple Computer, Inc. et al. Similar putative 
class actions have been filed in other California counties in which the 
Company was not named as a defendant. The complaints in all of these 
cases seek restitution in the form of refunds or product exchange, damages, 
punitive damages, and attorneys fees. In December 1995, the California 
Judicial Council ordered all of the California actions, including Long, 
coordinated for purposes of pretrial proceedings and trial before a single
judge, the Honorable William Cahill, sitting in the County of San 
Francisco. All of the California actions were subsequently coordinated 
under the name In re Computer Monitor Litigation and a master 
consolidated complaint filed superseding all of the individual complaints 
in those actions. On July 3, 1996, Judge Cahill ordered all of the California
cases dismissed without leave to amend as to plaintiffs residing in 
California on the ground that a stipulated judgment entered in September 
1995 in a prior action brought by the California Attorney General alleging
the same cause of action was res judicata as to the plaintiffs in the 
consolidated California class action suits. This order may be subject to 
appellate review at a later stage of the proceedings. Both the New Jersey
cases and the consolidated California cases are at a preliminary stage, with
no discovery having taken place.  

The Company has various claims, lawsuits, disputes with third parties, 
investigations, and pending actions involving allegations of false or 
misleading advertising, product defects, discrimination, infringement of 
intellectual property rights, and breach of contract and other matters 
against the Company and its subsidiaries incident to the operation of its
business. The liability, if any, associated with these matters is not 
determinable.

The Company believes the resolution of the foregoing actions will not 
have a material adverse effect on its financial condition. However, 
depending on the amount and timing of any unfavorable resolution of these
lawsuits, it is possible that the Company's results of operations could be 
materially affected in a particular period.

Industry Segment and Geographic Information 

The Company operates in one principal industry segment: the design, 
manufacture, and sale of personal computing products. The Company's 
products are sold primarily to the business, education, home, and 
government markets.

"Americas" comprises North and South America. "EMEA" is an 
abbreviation for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. "Asia Pacific" does 
not include Japan.  Prior year amounts have been restated to conform to 
the current year's presentation. "Net sales to unaffiliated customers" is 
based on the location of the customers. Transfers between geographic 
areas are recorded at amounts generally above cost and in accordance with 
the rules and regulations of the respective governing tax authorities. 
Operating income (loss) by geographic area consists of total net sales less 
operating expenses, and does not include an allocation of general corporate 
expenses. The restructuring charges recorded in 1996, and the adjustments 
recorded in 1995 and 1994 to the restructuring charges recorded in 1993, 
are included in the calculation of operating income (loss) for each 
geographic area. Identifiable assets of geographic areas are those assets 
used in the Company's operations in each area. Corporate assets include 
cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, equity securities, and 
joint venture investments.  


				47





A large portion of the Company's revenue is derived from its international 
operations, and a majority of the products sold internationally are 
manufactured in the Company's facilities in Cork, Ireland; and Singapore. 
As a result, the Company is subject to risks associated with foreign 
operations, such as obtaining governmental permits and approvals, 
currency exchange fluctuations, currency restrictions, political instability,
labor problems, trade restrictions, and changes in tariff and freight charges.

At September 27, 1996, there were 30,008 shareholders of record.

The Company began declaring quarterly cash dividends on its common 
stock in April 1987. The dividend policy is determined by the Board of 
Directors and is dependent on the Company's earnings, capital 
requirements financial condition and other factors. The Company 
suspended paying dividends on its common stock beginning in the second 
quarter of 1996. The Company anticipates that, for the foreseeable future, 
it will retain any earnings for use in the operation of its business.

The price range per common share represents the highest and lowest prices 
for the Company's common stock on the Nasdaq National Market during 
each quarter.

Net income for the fourth quarter of 1996 includes an adjustment to the 
1996 restructuring charge that increased income by $28 million.  Net loss 
for the second quarter of 1996 includes a $616 million charge for the 
write-down of certain inventory and related actions, as well as a $207 
million restructuring charge.  Net income for the third and first quarters of
1995 includes adjustments to the 1993 restructuring charge that increased 
income by $6 million and $17 million, respectively.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 


Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 
 


Apple Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively Apple or the Company) design,
manufacture, and market personal computers, portable digital music players, and mobile communication devices and sell a variety of related software, services, peripherals, and networking solutions. The Company sells its products worldwide through
its online stores, its retail stores, its direct sales force, and third-party wholesalers, resellers, and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Mac, iPod and iPhone compatible products including application
software, printers, storage devices, speakers, headphones, and various other accessories and supplies through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to consumer, small and mid-sized business (SMB), education, enterprise,
government, and creative customers. 
 
Basis of Presentation and Preparation 
 
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
materially from those estimates. Certain prior year amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 
 
The Companys fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Companys first quarter of fiscal years 2008 and 2007 contained 13 weeks and the first quarter of fiscal
year 2006 contained 14 weeks. The Companys fiscal years 2008 and 2007 ended on September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007, respectively, included 52 weeks, while fiscal year 2006 ended on September 30, 2006 included 53 weeks.
Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years or quarters refer to the Companys fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters of those fiscal years. 
 
Financial Instruments 
 
Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments 
 
All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. Highly liquid investments with
maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase are classified as short-term investments. The Companys debt and marketable equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. Management determines the
appropriate classification of its investments in debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates the available-for-sale designations as of each balance sheet date. These securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and
losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of shareholders equity. The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method. 
 
Derivative Financial Instruments 
 
The Company accounts for its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at
fair value. Derivatives that are not defined as hedges in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, 
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,
 as amended, must be adjusted to fair value
through earnings. 
 
For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges,
the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the
hedged transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in current earnings. To receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes
to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments that hedge
the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that are designated as fair value hedges, the net

gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in
earnings in the current period. The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure of the net investment in a foreign operation is reported in
the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For forward contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of
effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this component are recognized in current earnings. 
 
Inventories 
 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out method, or market. If the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value,
provisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. The Companys inventories consist primarily of finished goods for all periods presented. 
 
Property, Plant, and Equipment 
 
Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use of
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, up to 5 years for equipment, and the shorter of lease terms or 10 years for
leasehold improvements. The Company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 5 years. Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $363 million, $249 million, and $180 million during 2008, 2007, and 2006
respectively. 
 
Asset Retirement Obligations 
 
The
Company records obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs in accordance with SFAS No. 143, 
Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations
. The Company reviews legal
obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. If it is determined that a legal obligation exists, the fair value of the liability for an
asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying
amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. The difference between the gross expected future cash flow and its present value is accreted over the life of the related lease as an operating expense. All of the Companys existing asset
retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. The Companys asset retirement liability was $21 million and $18 million as of
September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007, respectively. 
 
Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets

 
The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment in accordance with SFAS
No. 144, 
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of.
 Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset
may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are
considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. The Company did not record any material impairments during 2008, 2007, and 2006. 
 
 


59 






Table of Contents


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 


Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 
 
 


SFAS No. 142, 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but rather be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. The Company performs its goodwill impairment tests on or
about August 31 of each year. The Company did not recognize any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in 2008, 2007, or 2006. The Company established reporting units based on its current reporting structure. For purposes of testing
goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit. 
 
SFAS No. 142 also
requires that intangible assets with definite lives be amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144. The Company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with definite
lives over periods ranging from 1 to 10 years. 
 
Foreign Currency Translation 
 
The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its international non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenue and expenses
for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are credited or charged to foreign currency translation included in accumulated other comprehensive income
in shareholders equity. The Companys foreign manufacturing subsidiaries and certain other international subsidiaries that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in
effect at the end of each period, and inventories, property, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. Gains and losses from these translations were insignificant and have been included in the Companys results of operations.

 
Revenue Recognition 
 
Net sales consist primarily of
revenue from the sale of hardware, software, music products, digital content, peripherals, and service and support contracts. For any product within these groups that either is software, or is considered software-related in accordance with the
guidance in Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 03-5, 
Applicability of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2 to Non-Software Deliverables in an Arrangement Containing More-Than-Incidental Software
 (e.g., Mac computers, iPod
portable digital music players and iPhones), the Company accounts for such products in accordance with the revenue recognition provisions of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position
(SOP) No. 97-2, 
Software Revenue Recognition
, as amended. The Company applies Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, 
Revenue Recognition,
 for products that are not software or software-related, such
as digital content sold on the iTunes Store and certain Mac, iPod and iPhone supplies and accessories. 
 
The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been
transferred. For most of the Companys product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers
revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed not
to be, fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met. 
 
Revenue from service and support contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the service coverage periods. These contracts typically include extended phone support, repair services, web-based support resources,
diagnostic tools, and extend the service coverage offered under the Companys one-year limited warranty.

Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 
 
 


The Company sells software and peripheral products obtained from other companies. The Company generally establishes
its own pricing and retains related inventory risk, is the primary obligor in sales transactions with its customers, and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. Accordingly, the Company generally recognizes revenue for the sale
of products obtained from other companies based on the gross amount billed. 
 
The Company accounts for multiple element arrangements that consist only of
software or software-related products in accordance with SOP No. 97-2. If a multiple-element arrangement includes deliverables that are neither software nor software-related, the Company applies EITF No. 00-21, 
Revenue Arrangements with
Multiple Deliverables,
 to determine if those deliverables constitute separate units of accounting from the SOP No. 97-2 deliverables. If the Company can separate the deliverables, the Company applies SOP No. 97-2 to the software and
software-related deliverables and applies other appropriate guidance (e.g., SAB No. 104) to the deliverables outside the scope of SOP No. 97-2. Revenue on arrangements that include multiple elements such as hardware, software, and services
is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element. Each elements allocated revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met. Fair value is generally determined by vendor
specific objective evidence (VSOE), which is based on the price charged when each element is sold separately. If the Company cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in a multiple-element
arrangement, the Company defers revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been performed, or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements. When the fair value of a delivered element has not
been established, the Company uses the residual method to recognize revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements is determinable. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of
the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue. 
 
The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated
commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. The estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue in
the period the Company has sold the product and committed to a plan. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Companys historical experience. Revenue is recorded net of taxes collected
from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority. 
 
Generally, the Company does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales or the sale of extended warranty and support contracts. When the Company does offer
specified upgrade rights, the Company defers revenue for the fair value of the specified upgrade right until the future obligation is fulfilled or when the right to the specified upgrade expires. Additionally, a limited number of the Companys
software products are available with maintenance agreements that grant customers rights to unspecified future upgrades over the maintenance term on a when and if available basis. Revenue associated with such maintenance is recognized ratably over
the maintenance term. 
 
In 2007, the Company began shipping Apple TV and iPhone. For Apple TV and iPhone, the Company indicated it may from time-to-time
provide future unspecified features and additional software products free of charge to customers. Accordingly, Apple TV and iPhone handsets sales are accounted for under subscription accounting in accordance with SOP No. 97-2. As such, the
Companys policy is to defer the associated revenue and cost of goods sold at the time of sale, and recognize both on a straight-line basis over the currently estimated 24-month economic life of these products, with any loss recognized at the
time of sale. Costs incurred by the Company for engineering, sales, marketing and warranty are expensed as incurred.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
 
The Company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. The Company considers historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of the
Companys customers, current economic conditions, and other factors that may affect customers ability to pay. 
 
Shipping Costs 


For all periods presented, amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue, and the Companys shipping and handling costs
are included in cost of sales.

Company generally provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. The Company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based
on actual experience and changes in future estimates. For products accounted for under subscription accounting pursuant to SOP No. 97-2, the Company recognizes warranty expense as incurred. 
 
Software Development Costs 
 
Research and development costs are
expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a products technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is
available for general release to customers pursuant to SFAS No. 86, 
Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed
. In most instances, the Companys products are released soon after technological feasibility has been
established. Therefore, costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally most software development costs have been expensed. 
 
During 2008, the Company capitalized $11 million of costs associated with the development of Mac OS X Version 10.6 Snow Leopard. In 2007, the Company determined that both
Mac OS X Version 10.5 Leopard (Mac OS X Leopard) and iPhone achieved technological feasibility. During 2007, the Company capitalized $75 million of costs associated with the development of Leopard and iPhone. In accordance with SFAS
No. 86, the capitalized costs related to Mac OS X Leopard and iPhone are amortized to cost of sales commencing when each respective product begins shipping and are recognized on a straight-line basis over a 3 year estimated useful life of the
underlying technology.
 
Total amortization related to capitalized software development costs was $27 million, $13 million, and $18 million in 2008, 2007, and
2006, respectively. 
 
Advertising Costs 
 
Advertising
costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $486 million, $467 million, and $338 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. 
 
Stock-Based Compensation 
 
The Company applies SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), 
Share-Based Payment
, for stock-based payment
transactions in which the Company receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by
the issuance of such equity instruments. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) option-pricing model to determine the fair-value of stock-based awards under SFAS No. 123R. 
 
SFAS No. 123R prohibits recognition of a deferred tax asset for an excess tax benefit that has not been realized. The Company will recognize a benefit from
stock-based compensation in equity if an incremental tax benefit is

realized by following the ordering provisions of the tax law. In addition, the Company accounts for the indirect effects of stock-based compensation on the
research tax credit, the foreign tax credit, and the domestic manufacturing deduction through the income statement. 
 
Further information regarding
stock-based compensation can be found in Note 6, Shareholders Equity, and Note 7, Stock-Based Compensation. 
 
Income Taxes

 
In accordance with SFAS No. 109, 
Accounting for Income Taxes
, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability
method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a
valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. 
 
During 2008, the Company adopted the
Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Financial Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, 
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109
. FIN 48 changes the accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes by creating a new framework for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose uncertain tax positions in their financial statements. Under FIN 48, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an
uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such
positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. FIN 48 also provides guidance on the reversal of previously recognized tax positions, balance sheet classifications,
accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. See Note 5, Income Taxes for additional information, including the effects of adoption on the Companys Consolidated Financial
Statements. 
 
Earnings Per Common Share 
 
Basic earnings
per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to
common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities
had been issued. Potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options, shares to be purchased under the employee stock purchase plan, and unvested restricted stock units (RSUs). The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive
securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the Companys common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from
potentially dilutive securities.

been antidilutive. 
 
Comprehensive Income 
 
Comprehensive
income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains, and losses that under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of
shareholders equity but are excluded from net income. The Companys other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized
gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges. 
 
Segment Information 
 
The Company reports segment information based on the management approach. The
management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Companys reportable segments. Information about the Companys products, major customers, and
geographic areas on a company-wide basis is also disclosed.

The Companys U.S. Corporate Securities consist primarily of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, time
deposits, and corporate debt securities. Foreign Securities consist primarily of foreign commercial paper issued by foreign companies, and certificates of deposit and time deposits with foreign institutions, most of which are denominated in U.S.
dollars. As of September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007, approximately $2.4 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, of the Companys short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from one to five years. The remaining
short-term investments had maturities less than 12 months. The Company had $117 million in net unrealized losses on its investment portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities ranging from one to five years, as of
September 27, 2008, and net unrealized losses of approximately $11 million on its investment portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities from one to five years, as of September 29, 2007. The Company may sell its
investments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. The Company recognized no material net gains or losses during 2008, 2007 and 2006 related to such sales.

The unrealized losses on the Companys investments in U.S. Treasury and Agency Securities, U.S. Corporate
Securities, and Foreign Securities were caused primarily by changes in interest rates, specifically, widening credit spreads. The Companys investment policy requires investments to be rated single-A or better with the objective of minimizing
the potential risk of principal loss. Therefore, the Company considers the declines to be temporary in nature. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating the investments for
other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, and the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment
for a period of time, which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value. During 2008, the Company did not record any material impairment charges on its outstanding securities. As of September 27, 2008, the Company does not
consider any of its investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired. 
 
Accounts Receivable 
 
Trade Receivables 
 
The Company distributes its products through
third-party distributors and resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and commercial customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk
on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Australia and by arranging with third-party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the
Companys direct customers. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of
these arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables not covered by collateral, third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Companys distribution and retail channel partners. Trade receivables from
two of the Companys customers accounted for 15% and 10% of trade receivables as of September 27, 2008, while one customer accounted for approximately 11% of trade receivables as of September 29, 2007.

Vendor Non-Trade Receivables 
 
The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final
products for the Company. The Company purchases these raw material components directly from suppliers. These non-trade receivables, which are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in other current assets, totaled $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion
as of September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007, respectively. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in net sales and does not recognize any profits on these sales until the related products are sold by the Company, at
which time the profit is recognized as a reduction of cost of sales. 
 
Derivative Financial Instruments 
 
The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange risk. Foreign currency forward and option contracts are used to offset the
foreign exchange risk on certain existing assets and liabilities and to hedge the foreign exchange risk on expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales. The Companys accounting policies for these instruments are
based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. 
 
The following table shows the notional principal, net fair value, and credit risk amounts of the Companys foreign currency instruments as of September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007 (in millions):

The notional principal amounts for derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding
as of year-end, and do not represent the amount of the Companys exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts shown in the table above represents the Companys gross exposure to potential accounting loss on these transactions
if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency exchange rates at each respective date. The Companys exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a function of
currency exchange rates.

Note 2Financial Instruments (Continued) 
 
 


The estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models and prevailing financial market
information as of September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007. Although the table above reflects the notional principal, fair value, and credit risk amounts of the Companys foreign exchange instruments, it does not reflect the gains or
losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the foreign exchange instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying
exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. 
 
Foreign Exchange Risk Management 
 
The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risk associated with existing
assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Generally, the Companys practice is to hedge some portion of its material foreign exchange exposures.
However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to, immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, or limited availability of appropriate
hedging instruments. 
 
To help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Companys U.S. dollar
functional subsidiaries hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and the Companys non-U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries selling in local currencies hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the
subsidiaries functional currency. Other comprehensive income associated with hedges of foreign currency revenue is recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related sales are recognized, and other comprehensive income
related to inventory purchases is recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Typically, the Company hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and
inventory purchases for three to six months. 
 
Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the
forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent 2 month time period. Deferred gains and losses in other comprehensive income associated with such derivative instruments are immediately
reclassified into earnings in other income and expense. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are also reflected in current earnings unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. The Company has not
recognized any material net gains during 2008, 2007 and 2006, related to the loss of a hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges. As of September 27, 2008, the Company had a net deferred gain associated with cash flow hedges of
approximately $19 million, net of taxes, substantially all of which is expected to be reclassified to earnings by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2009. 
 
The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument designated as a net investment hedge is included in the cumulative translation adjustment account of accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders
equity. For the years ended September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007, the Company had a net loss on net investment hedges of $12.2 million and $2.6 million, respectively, included in the cumulative translation adjustment. 
 
The Company may also enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain
assets and liabilities recorded in non-functional currencies. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in current earnings in other income and expense as offsets to the changes in the fair value of the related assets or
liabilities. Due to currency market movements, changes in option time value can lead to increased volatility in other income and expense.

In June 2008, the Company completed an acquisition of a business for total cash consideration, net of cash
acquired, of $220 million, of which $169 million has been allocated to goodwill, $51 million to deferred tax assets and $7 million to acquired intangible assets. 
 
The Companys goodwill is allocated primarily to the Americas reportable operating segment. Amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets was $46 million, $35 million, and $12 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006,
respectively. As of September 27, 2008, and September 29, 2007, the remaining weighted-average amortization period for acquired technology was 7.0 years and 7.1 years, respectively. 
 
Expected annual amortization expense related to acquired technology as of September 27, 2008, is as follows (in millions):

The foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pretax earnings of $3.5 billion, $2.2 billion, and $1.5
billion in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. As of September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007, $11.3 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively, of the Companys cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were held by foreign
subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. The Companys consolidated financial statements provide for
any related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated, aside from undistributed earnings of certain of the Companys foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the U.S. U.S. income taxes
have not been provided on a cumulative total of $3.8 billion of such earnings. It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that might be incurred if these earnings were to be distributed. 
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits, and the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled.

As of September 27, 2008, the Company has tax loss and credit carryforwards in the tax effected amount of $47
million. The Company released a valuation allowance of $5 million recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefit of state operating losses. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be
generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets.

The Companys income taxes payable have been reduced by the tax benefits from employee stock options and
employee stock purchase plan. The Company receives an income tax benefit calculated as the difference between the fair market value of the stock issued at the time of the exercise and the option price, tax effected. The net tax benefits
from employee stock option transactions were $770 million, $398 million, and $419 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, and were reflected as an increase to common stock in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity.

 
On October 3, 2008, the Tax Extenders and Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008 was signed into law. This bill, among other things, retroactively
extended the expired research and development tax credit. As a result, the Company expects to record a tax benefit of approximately $42 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 to account for the retroactive effects of the research credit
extension.

FIN 48 
 
In
the first quarter of 2008, the Company adopted FIN 48. Upon adoption of FIN 48, the Companys cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulted in an increase to retained earnings of $11 million. The Company had historically
classified interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits as current liabilities. Beginning with the adoption of FIN 48, the Company classifies gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in
payment or receipt of cash within one year as non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of the date of adoption of FIN 48 was $475 million, of which $209 million, if
recognized, would affect the Companys effective tax rate. As of September 27, 2008, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $506 million, of which $253 million, if recognized, would affect the Companys effective tax
rate. The Companys total gross unrecognized tax benefits are classified as non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
The aggregate
changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for the fiscal year ended September 27, 2008, is as follows (in millions):

The Companys policy to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the
provision for income taxes did not change as a result of adopting FIN 48. As of the date of adoption, the Company had accrued $203 million for the gross interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits. As of September 27, 2008, the
total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $219 million, which is classified as non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In 2008, the Company recognized interest expense in connection with tax matters of $16 million.

 
The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. For U.S.
federal income tax purposes, all years prior to 2002 are closed. The years 2002-2003 have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) and disputed issues have been taken to administrative appeals. The IRS is currently
examining the 2004-2006 years. In addition, the Company is also subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities. In major states and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 1988 and 2000, respectively, generally
remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities. 
 
Management believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments
that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Companys tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the
Company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs. Although timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, the Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that its
unrecognized tax benefits would materially change in the next 12 months.

Note 6Shareholders Equity 
 
 


Preferred Stock 
 
The Company has five million shares of authorized preferred stock, none of which is issued or outstanding. Under the terms of the Companys Restated Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors is authorized to determine or alter
the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the Companys authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock. 
 
CEO Restricted Stock
Award 
 
On March 19, 2003, the Companys Board of Directors granted 10 million shares of restricted stock to the Companys CEO
that vested on March 19, 2006. The amount of the restricted stock award expensed by the Company was based on the closing market price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant and was amortized ratably on a straight-line basis
over the three-year requisite service period. Upon vesting during 2006, the 10 million shares of restricted stock had a fair value of $646.6 million and had grant-date fair value of $7.48 per share. The restricted stock award was net-share
settled such that the Company withheld shares with value equivalent to the CEOs minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares
withheld of 4.6 million were based on the value of the restricted stock award on the vesting date as determined by the Companys closing stock price of $64.66. The remaining shares net of those withheld were delivered to the Companys
CEO. Total payments for the CEOs tax obligations to the taxing authorities was $296 million in 2006 and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The net-share settlement had the effect of
share repurchases by the Company as it reduced and retired the number of shares outstanding and did not represent an expense to the Company. The Companys CEO has no remaining shares of restricted stock. For the year ended September 30,
2006, compensation expense related to restricted stock was $4.6 million. 
 
Comprehensive Income 
 
Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains, and losses that
under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders equity but are excluded from net income. The Companys other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from
those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as
cash flow hedges. 
 
The following table summarizes the components of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of taxes, as of the three fiscal years ended
September 27, 2008 (in millions):

respectively.

Employee Benefit Plans 
 
2003 Employee Stock Plan

 
The 2003 Employee Stock Plan (the 2003 Plan) is a shareholder approved plan that provides for broad-based grants to employees,
including executive officers. Based on the terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 2003 Plan generally expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based on continued
employment, with either annual or quarterly vesting. The 2003 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, stock purchase rights and performance-based awards. As of
September 27, 2008, approximately 50.3 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2003 Plan. 
 
1997 Employee Stock Option
Plan 
 
In August 1997, the Companys Board of Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 1997 Plan), a
non-shareholder approved plan for grants of stock options to employees who are not officers of the Company. Based on the terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 1997 Plan generally expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and
generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based on continued employment, with either annual or quarterly vesting. In October 2003, the Company terminated the 1997 Plan and no new options can be granted from this plan. 
 
1997 Director Stock Option Plan 
 
In
August 1997, the Companys Board of Directors adopted a Director Stock Option Plan (the Director Plan) for non-employee directors of the Company, which was approved by shareholders in 1998. Pursuant to the Director Plan, the
Companys non-employee directors are granted an option to acquire 30,000 shares of common stock upon their initial election to the Board (Initial Options

). The Initial Options vest and become
exercisable in three equal annual installments on each of the first through third anniversaries of the grant date. On the fourth anniversary of a non-employee directors initial election to the Board and on each subsequent anniversary
thereafter, the director will be entitled to receive an option to acquire 10,000 shares of common stock (Annual Options). Annual Options are fully vested and immediately exercisable on their date of grant. Options granted under the
Director Plan expire 10 years after the grant date. As of September 27, 2008, approximately 290,000 shares were reserved for future issuance under the Director Plan. 
 
 
Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans 
 
The following executive officers, Timothy D. Cook, Peter Oppenheimer, Philip W.
Schiller, and Bertrand Serlet, have entered into trading plans pursuant to Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), as of November 1, 2008. A trading plan is a written document that

pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Companys
stock including the exercise and sale of employee stock options and shares acquired pursuant to the Companys employee stock purchase plan and upon vesting of RSUs. 
 
Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
 
The Company has a shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan (the
Purchase Plan), under which substantially all employees may purchase common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values as of the beginning and end of six-month offering periods. Stock
purchases under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of an employees compensation, up to a maximum of $25,000 in any calendar year. The number of shares authorized to be purchased in any calendar year is limited to a total of 3 million
shares. As of September 27, 2008, approximately 6.2 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan. 
 
Employee
Savings Plan 
 
The Company has an employee savings plan (the Savings Plan) qualifying as a deferred salary arrangement under
Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the Savings Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the IRS annual contribution limit ($15,500 for calendar year 2008). The Company matches 50%
to 100% of each employees contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employees eligible earnings. The Companys matching contributions to the Savings Plan were $50 million, $39 million, and $33 million
in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

Aggregate intrinsic value represents the value of the Companys closing stock price on the last trading day of
the fiscal period in excess of the exercise price multiplied by the number of options outstanding or exercisable. Total intrinsic value of options at time of exercise was $2.0 billion, $1.3 billion, and $1.2 billion for 2008, 2007, and 2006,
respectively. 
 
Shares of RSUs granted after April 2005 have been deducted from the shares available for grant under the Companys stock option plans
utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. Similarly shares of RSUs granted after April 2005, that are subsequently cancelled have been added back to the shares available for grant under the Companys stock option plans
utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs cancelled.

Upon vesting, the RSUs are generally net share-settled to cover the required withholding tax and the remaining
amount is converted into an equivalent number of shares of common stock. The majority of RSUs vested in 2008, 2007 and 2006, were net-share settled such that the Company withheld shares with value equivalent to the employees minimum statutory
obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 857,000, 20,000, and 986,000 for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, which was
based on the value of the RSUs on their vesting date as determined by the Companys closing stock price. Total payments for the employees tax obligations to the taxing authorities were $124 million, $3 million, and $59 million in 2008,
2007, and 2006, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These net-share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the Company as they reduced and retired the number of
shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting and did not represent an expense to the Company. 
 
The Company recognized $516
million, $242 million and $163 million of stock-based compensation expense in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense capitalized as software development costs was not significant as of September 27, 2008 or
September 29, 2007. The income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation expense was $169 million, $81 million, and $39 million for the years ended September 27, 2008, September 29, 2007, and September 30, 2006,
respectively. The total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options and RSUs expected to vest was $1.4 billion and $631 million as of September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007, respectively. The total unrecognized compensation
cost as of September 27, 2008, is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.92 years.

Note 7Stock-Based Compensation 
 
 


SFAS No. 123R requires the use of a valuation model to calculate the fair value of stock-based awards. The
Company uses the BSM option-pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock-based awards. The BSM option-pricing model incorporates various assumptions including expected volatility, expected life, and interest rates. The expected
volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Companys common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Companys stock options and other relevant factors including implied volatility
in market traded options on the Companys common stock. The Company bases its expected life assumption on its historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards it grants to employees. Stock-based compensation cost is
estimated at the grant date based on the awards fair-value as calculated by the BSM option-pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. 
 
The compensation expense incurred by the Company for RSUs is based on the closing market price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant and is amortized
ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. 
 
The weighted-average assumptions used for the three fiscal years ended
September 27, 2008, and the resulting estimates of weighted-average fair value per share of options granted and of employee stock purchase plan rights during those periods are as follows:

Note 8Commitments and Contingencies 
 
Lease Commitments 
 
The Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable
operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any other off-balance sheet financing arrangements. The major facility leases are generally for terms of 3 to 20 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of 1 to 5
additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms of 5 to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of September 27, 2008, the Companys total future minimum lease payments
under noncancelable operating leases were $1.8 billion, of which $1.4 billion related to leases for retail space.

Accrued Warranty and Indemnifications 
 
The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period for hardware products is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. The Company also
offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the Companys hardware products. The Company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product warranties at the time related
revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical and projected warranty claim rates,
historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Companys typical experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as
necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates. For products accounted for under subscription accounting pursuant to SOP No. 97-2, the Company recognizes warranty expense as incurred. 
 
The Company periodically provides updates to its applications and system software to maintain the softwares compliance with published specifications. The estimated
cost to develop such updates is accounted for as warranty costs that are recognized at the time related software revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units
delivered, the number of updates expected to occur, and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates. 
 
The following table reconciles changes in the Companys accrued warranties and related costs for the three fiscal years ended September 27, 2008 (in millions):

The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal
claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of
an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party.

However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified
third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results.
Therefore, the Company did not record a liability for infringement costs as of either September 27, 2008 or September 29, 2007. 
 
Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product 
 
Although most components essential to the Companys
business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components including, but not limited to microprocessors, enclosures, certain liquid crystal displays (LCDs), certain optical drives, and application-specific integrated
circuits (ASICs) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources, which subjects the Company to significant supply and pricing risks. Many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources
including, but not limited to NAND flash memory, dynamic random access memory (DRAM), and certain LCDs, are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. In addition, the Company has entered
into certain agreements for the supply of key components including, but not limited to microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs at favorable pricing, but there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these
agreements on similar favorable terms, or at all, upon expiration or otherwise obtain favorable pricing in the future. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and/or price increases that can have a material
adverse effect on its financial condition and operating results. 
 
The Company and other participants in the personal computer, consumer electronics and
mobile communication industries also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for 
 
their products. In
addition, the Company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer, consumer electronics and mobile communication industries, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components
available from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the
suppliers yields have matured. If the Companys supply of a key single-sourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, if such components were available only at significantly higher prices, or if a key
manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Companys business and financial performance could also be
adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices,
or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements. 
 
Significant portions of the Companys Mac computers, iPods, iPhones, logic boards, and other assembled products are now manufactured by outsourcing partners, primarily in various parts of Asia. A significant
concentration of this outsourced manufacturing is currently performed by only a few of the Companys outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced supplier of components and
manufacturing outsourcing for many of the Companys key products including, but not limited to final assembly of substantially all of the Companys portable Mac computers, iPods, iPhones and most of the Companys iMacs. Although the
Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Companys operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The Companys
purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 


Note 8Commitments and Contingencies (Continued) 
 
 


Long-Term Supply Agreements 
 
During 2006, the Company entered into long-term supply agreements with Hynix Semiconductor, Inc., Intel Corporation, Micron Technology, Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and Toshiba Corporation to secure supply of
NAND flash memory through calendar year 2010. As part of these agreements, the Company prepaid $1.25 billion for flash memory components during 2006, which will be applied to certain inventory purchases made over the life of each respective
agreement. The Company utilized $567 million of the prepayment as of September 27, 2008. 
 
Contingencies 
 
The Company is subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully adjudicated. In the
opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results.
However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. If the Company failed to prevail in any of these legal matters or if several of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the
operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. 
 
Production and marketing of products in certain states and
countries may subject the Company to environmental, product safety and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for
environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including various countries within Europe and Asia, certain Canadian provinces and
certain states within the U.S. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will
not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition or operating results. 
 
Note 9Segment Information and Geographic Data

 
In accordance with SFAS No. 131, 
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information
, the Company
reports segment information based on the management approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Companys reportable
segments.
 
 
The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. Accordingly, the Company determined its operating segments, which are
generally based on the nature and location of its customers, to be the Americas, Europe, Japan, Asia-Pacific, Retail, and FileMaker operations. The Companys reportable operating segments consist of Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail
operations. Other operating segments include Asia Pacific, which encompasses Australia and Asia except for Japan, and the Companys FileMaker, Inc. subsidiary. The Americas, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific segments exclude activities related to
the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries, as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Retail segment operates Apple-owned retail stores in the U.S. and in
international markets. Each reportable operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services to the same types of customers. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1,
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. 
 
The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales and operating
income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers, while Retail segment net sales are based on sales from the Companys retail stores. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third
parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising

expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and
expense and certain expenses managed outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses, such as manufacturing costs and variances not included in standard costs, research and development,
corporate marketing expenses, stock-based compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges, and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for
management reporting purposes. Segment assets exclude corporate assets, such as cash, short-term and long-term investments, manufacturing and corporate facilities, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible
assets. Except for the Retail segment, capital asset purchases for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment. Cash payments for capital asset purchases by the Retail segment were $389 million, $294 million, and $200 million for
2008, 2007, and 2006 respectively. 
 
The Company has certain retail stores that have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand
awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Companys more typical retail stores. The
Company allocates certain operating expenses associated with its high-profile stores to corporate marketing expense to reflect the estimated Company-wide benefit. The allocation of these operating costs to corporate expense is based on the amount
incurred for a high-profile store in excess of that incurred by a more typical Company retail location. The Company had opened a total of 11 high-profile stores as of September 27, 2008. Expenses allocated to corporate marketing resulting from
the operations of high-profile stores were $53 million, $39 million, and $33 million for the years ended September 27, 2008, September 29, 2007, and September 30, 2006 respectively.

Note 10Related Party Transactions and Certain Other Transactions 
 
The Company entered into a Reimbursement Agreement with its CEO, Steve Jobs, for the reimbursement of expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs in the operation of his private plane when used for Apple business. The Company recognized a total of
approximately $871,000, $776,000, and $202,000 in expenses pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement during 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. All expenses recognized pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement have been included in selling, general, and
administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 
In 2006, the Company entered into an agreement with Pixar to sell certain of
Pixars short films on the iTunes Store. Mr. Jobs was the CEO, Chairman, and a large shareholder of Pixar. On May 5, 2006, The Walt Disney Company (Disney) acquired Pixar, which resulted in Pixar becoming a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Disney. Upon Disneys acquisition of Pixar, Mr. Jobs shares of Pixar common stock were exchanged for Disneys common stock and he was elected to the Disney Board of Directors. Royalty expense recognized by the
Company under the arrangement with Pixar from September 25, 2005 through May 5, 2006 was less than $1 million.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
The Board of Directors and Shareholders 
 
Apple Inc.: 
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 27, 2008. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. 
 
We conducted our
audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Apple Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 27, 2008, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
As discussed in note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, effective September 30, 2007, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, 
Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxesan interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109
. 
 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Apple Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2008, based on criteria established in 
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated November 4, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
The Board of Directors and Shareholders 
 
Apple Inc.: 
 
We have audited Apple Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2008, based on criteria established in
 Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Apples management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
In
our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2008, based on criteria established in 
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework
 issued by the COSO.

 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of
Apple Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
September 27, 2008, and our report dated November 4, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


Note 1Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies


Apple Computer, Inc.
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the Company) designs, manufactures, and
markets personal computers and related software, services, peripherals, and
networking solutions. The Company also designs, develops, and markets a line of
portable digital music players along with related accessories and services
including the online sale of third-party audio and video products. The Company
sells its products worldwide through its online stores, its retail stores, its
direct sales force, and third-party wholesalers, resellers, and value-added
resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Macintosh
and iPod compatible products including application software, printers, storage
devices, speakers, headphones, and various other accessories and supplies
through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to education, consumer,
creative professional, business, and government customers.


Basis of
Presentation and Preparation


The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated. The preparation of these consolidated financial
statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior year
amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been
reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.


Typically, the Companys
fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of September. Fiscal years 2005 and 2004
 were each 52-week
years. However, approximately every six years, the Company reports a 53-week
fiscal year to align its fiscal quarters with calendar quarters by adding a
week to its first fiscal quarter. The Company added this additional week in the
first fiscal quarter of its fiscal year 2006. All information presented herein
is based on the Companys fiscal calendar.


Common Stock Split


On February 28, 2005,
the Company effected a two-for-one stock split to shareholders of record as of February 18,
2005. All share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to
reflect the stock split.


Financial
Instruments


Cash Equivalents
and Short-term Investments


All highly liquid
investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are
classified as cash equivalents. Highly liquid investments with maturities
greater than three months at the date of purchase are classified as short-term
investments. The Companys debt and marketable equity securities have been
classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. Management
determines the appropriate classification of its investments in debt and
marketable equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates the
available-for-sale designations as of each balance sheet date. These securities
are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes,
reported as a component of shareholders equity. The cost of securities sold is
based upon the specific identification method.


Derivative
Financial Instruments


The Company accounts for its derivative instruments as
either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value. Derivatives that
are not defined as hedges in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 133, 
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities,
 as amended, must be adjusted to fair value
through earnings. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the
hedge, 


77
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 1Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies
 (Continued)


changes in fair value will either be offset against
the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments
through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged
item is recognized in earnings.


For derivative instruments
that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are
designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on
the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income in shareholders equity and reclassified into earnings in
the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects
earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative
instrument is recognized in current earnings. To receive hedge accounting
treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to
expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. For derivative instruments
that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability
and that are designated as fair value hedges, the net gain or loss on the
derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item
attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current
period. The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative
instrument that is designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency
translation exposure of the net investment in a foreign operation is reported
in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For forward contracts
designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value
relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of
effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this component are
recognized in current earnings.


Inventories


Inventories are stated at
the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out method, or market. If
the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are made
currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. The Companys
inventories consist primarily of finished goods for all periods presented.


Property, Plant,
and Equipment


Property, plant, and
equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is
the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, up to
5 years for equipment, and the shorter of lease terms or 10 years for leasehold
improvements. The Company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop
internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project
stage. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which
range from 3 to 5 years. Depreciation and amortization expense on property and
equipment was $180 million, $141 million, and $126 million during 2006, 2005,
and 2004, respectively.


Asset Retirement
Obligations


The Company records obligations associated with the
retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement
costs in accordance with SFAS No. 143, 
Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations
. The Company reviews legal obligations
associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the
acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. If it
is determined that a legal obligation exists, the fair value of the liability
for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is
incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of
the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this
additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. The
difference between the gross expected future cash flow and its 


78
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 1Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)


present value is accreted over the life of the related
lease as an operating expense. All of the Companys existing asset retirement
obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to
operating leases to original condition upon lease termination.

Long-Lived
Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets


The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment and
certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment in
accordance with SFAS No. 144, 
Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of.

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability
of these assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future
undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property,
plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be
impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the
carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. For the three
fiscal years ended September 30, 2006, the Company had no material
impairment of its long-lived assets, except for the impairment of certain
assets in connection with the restructuring actions described in Note 6 of
these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.


SFAS No. 142, 
Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets
 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but rather be tested for
impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. The Company performs its
goodwill impairment tests on or about August 30 of each year. The Company
did not recognize any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in 2006,
2005, or 2004. The Company established reporting units based on its current
reporting structure. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill
has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each
reporting unit.


SFAS No. 142 also
requires that intangible assets with definite lives be amortized over their
estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144.
The Company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with
definite lives over periods ranging from 3 to 10 years.


Foreign Currency
Translation


The Company translates the assets and liabilities of
its international non-U.S. functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars
using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenue and expenses
for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in
effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are credited
or charged to foreign currency translation 


79
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 1Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)


included in accumulated
other comprehensive income in shareholders equity. The Companys foreign
manufacturing subsidiaries and certain other international subsidiaries that
use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and
liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each  period, and inventories, property, and
nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. Gains and losses from
these translations were insignificant and have been included in the Companys
results of operations.


Revenue Recognition


Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale
of hardware, software, peripherals, digital content, and service and support
contracts. The Company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting
standards, including American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97-2, 
Software
Revenue Recognition
, as amended, and Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, 
Revenue Recognition
.


The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is
fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered
delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss
have been transferred. For most of the Companys product sales, these criteria
are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals,
for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales,
the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the
Company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during
transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the
arrangement fee is not, or is presumed not to be, fixed or determinable,
revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and
payable.


Revenue from service and support contracts is deferred
and recognized ratably over the service coverage periods. These contracts
typically include extended phone support, repair services, web-based support
resources, diagnostic tools, and extend the service coverage offered under the
Companys one-year limited warranty.


The Company sells software and peripheral products
obtained from other companies. The Company establishes its own pricing and
retains related inventory risk, is the primary obligor in sales transactions
with its customers, and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its
customers. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue for the sale of products
obtained from other companies based on the gross amount billed.


Revenue on arrangements
that include multiple elements such as hardware, software, and services is
allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element.
Each elements allocated revenue is recognized when revenue recognition
criteria for that element have been met. Fair value is generally determined by
vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE), which is based on the price
charged when each element is sold separately. If the Company cannot objectively
determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in a
multiple-element arrangement, the Company defers revenue until all elements are
delivered and services have been performed, or until fair value can objectively
be determined for any remaining undelivered elements. When the fair value of a
delivered element has not been established, the Company uses the residual method
to recognize revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements is
determinable. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered
elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is
allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue.


80
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 1Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)


The Company records reductions to revenue for
estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive
programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and
volume-based incentives. The estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a
reduction to revenue in the  period the
Company has sold the product and committed to a plan. The Company also records
reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Companys
historical experience.


Generally, the Company
does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in
connection with software sales or the sale of extended warranty and support
contracts. When the Company does offer specified upgrade rights, the Company
defers revenue for the fair value of the specified upgrade right until the
future obligation is fulfilled or when the right to the specified upgrade
expires. Additionally, a limited number of the Companys software products are
available with maintenance agreements that grant customers rights to
unspecified future upgrades over the maintenance term on a when and if
available basis. Revenue associated with such maintenance is recognized ratably
over the maintenance term.


Allowance for
Doubtful Accounts


The Company records its
allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. The
Company considers historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable
balances, credit quality of the Companys customers, current economic
conditions, and other factors that may affect customers ability to pay.


Shipping Costs


For all periods presented,
amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as
revenue, and the Companys shipping and handling costs are included in cost of
sales.


Warranty Expense


The Company provides for
the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related
revenue is recognized. The Company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting
warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual
experience and changes in future estimates.


Software
Development Costs


Research and development costs are expensed as
incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or
otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a products
technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is
available for general release to customers pursuant to SFAS No. 86, 
Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed
.
In most instances, the Companys products are released soon after technological
feasibility has been established. Therefore, costs incurred subsequent to
achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and
generally all software development costs have been immediately expensed.


In 2004, the Company began
incurring substantial development costs associated with Mac OS X version 10.4
Tiger (Tiger) subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility as
evidenced by public demonstration in August 2004 and the subsequent
release of a developer beta version of the product. The Company capitalized
approximately $29.7 million and $4.5 million during 2005 and 2004,
respectively, of costs associated with the development of Tiger. In accordance
with SFAS No. 86, amortization of this asset to cost of sales began in April 2005
when the Company began shipping Tiger and is being recognized on a
straight-line basis over a three-year estimated useful life.

Note 1Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)


During 2004, the Company incurred substantial
development costs associated with FileMaker Pro 7 subsequent to achievement of
technological feasibility as evidenced by public demonstration and release of a
developer beta version, and prior to the release of the final version of the
product in March 2004. Therefore, during 2004, the Company capitalized
approximately $2.3 million of costs associated with the development of
FileMaker Pro 7. In accordance with SFAS No. 86, amortization of this
asset to cost of sales began in March 2004 when the Company began shipping
FileMaker Pro 7 and is being recognized on a straight-line basis over a
three-year estimated useful life.


Total amortization related
to capitalized software development costs was $17.8 million, $15.7 million, and
$10.7 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.


Advertising Costs


Advertising costs are
expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $338 million, $287 million, and
$206 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.


Stock-Based
Compensation


On September 25, 2005, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123
(revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), 
Share-Based Payment
,
which addresses the accounting for stock-based payment transactions in which an
enterprise receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity
instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on the
fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by the
issuance of such equity instruments. In January 2005, the SEC issued SAB No. 107,
which provides supplemental implementation guidance for SFAS No. 123R.
SFAS No. 123R eliminates the ability to account for stock-based
compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method under Accounting
Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, 
Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees
, and instead generally requires that
such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. The Company
uses the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) option-pricing model to determine the
fair-value of stock-based awards under SFAS No. 123R, consistent with that
used for pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123, 
Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation
. The Company has elected to use the
modified prospective transition method as permitted by SFAS No. 123R and
accordingly prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of SFAS No. 123R.
The modified prospective transition method requires that stock-based
compensation expense be recorded for all new and unvested stock options,
restricted stock, restricted stock units, and employee stock purchase plan
shares that are ultimately expected to vest as the requisite service is
rendered beginning on September 25, 2005, the first day of the Companys
fiscal year 2006. Stock-based compensation expense for awards granted prior to September 25,
2005 is based on the grant-date fair-value as determined under the pro forma
provisions of SFAS No. 123. The Company recognized incremental stock-based
compensation expense of $117 million during 2006 as a result of the adoption of
SFAS No. 123R. Diluted earnings per common share was reduced by $0.10 for
the year ended September 30, 2006 due to the adoption of SFAS
No. 123R. In accordance with SFAS No. 123R, beginning in 2006 the
Company has presented excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock-based
compensation awards as a financing activity in the consolidated statement of
cash flows.


No stock-based
compensation costs have been capitalized as of September 30, 2006. The
income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation expense was $39 million
for the year ended September 30, 2006. As of September 30, 2006,
$375.2 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options
and restricted stock units is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
period of 2.91 years.


82
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 1Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)


SFAS No. 123R prohibits recognition of a deferred
tax asset for an excess tax benefit that has not been realized. The Company
will recognize a benefit from stock-based compensation in equity if an
incremental tax benefit is realized by following the ordering provisions of the
tax law. In addition, the Company accounts for the indirect effects of
stock-based compensation on the research tax credit, the foreign tax credit,
and the domestic manufacturing deduction through the income statement.


Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the
Company measured compensation expense for its employee stock-based compensation
plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25.
The Company applied the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123 as amended
by SFAS No. 148, 
Accounting for Stock-Based
CompensationTransition and Disclosure,
 as if the fair-value-based
method had been applied in measuring compensation expense. Under APB Opinion No. 25,
when the exercise price of the Companys employee stock options was equal to
the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant, no
compensation expense was recognized.


The following table
illustrates the effect on net income after taxes and net income per common
share as if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of
SFAS No. 123 to stock-based compensation during 2005 and 2004 (in
millions, except per share amounts):

Earnings Per Common
Share


Basic earnings per common share is computed by
dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number
of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per
common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by
the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock
that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of common
stock had been issued. The dilutive effect of outstanding options, restricted
stock, and restricted stock units is reflected in diluted earnings per share by
application of the treasury stock method. Under the 


83
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 1Summary

treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market
value of the Companys common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect
from outstanding options, restricted stock, and restricted stock units. Additionally,
the exercise of employee stock options and the vesting of restricted stock and
restricted stock units can result in a greater dilutive effect on earnings per
share.

Comprehensive
Income


Comprehensive income
consists of two components: net income and other comprehensive income. Other
comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains, and losses that under
generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of
shareholders equity but are excluded from net income. The Companys other
comprehensive income is comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments
from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency,
unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as
available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments
accounted for as cash flow hedges.


Segment Information


The Company reports segment information based on the
management approach. The management approach designates the internal
reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as
the source of the Companys reportable segments. Information about the
Companys products, major customers, and geographic areas on a company-wide
basis is also disclosed.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 2Restatement of
Consolidated Financial Statements


The Company is restating its consolidated balance
sheet as of September 24, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years
ended September 24, 2005 and September 25, 2004, and each of the
quarters in fiscal year 2005.


Previously filed annual reports on Form 10-K
and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q affected by the restatements have
not been amended and should not be relied on.


On June 29, 2006, the Company announced that an
internal review had discovered irregularities related to the issuance of
certain stock option grants made between 1997 and 2001, including a grant to
its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Steve Jobs. The Company also announced that
a Special Committee of outside directors (Special Committee) had been formed
and had hired independent counsel to conduct a full investigation of the
Companys past stock option granting practices.


As a result of the internal review and the independent
investigation, management has concluded, and the Audit and Finance Committee of
the Board of Directors agrees, that incorrect measurement dates were used for
financial accounting purposes for certain stock option grants made in prior
periods. Therefore, the Company has recorded additional non-cash stock-based
compensation expense and related tax effects with regard to past stock option
grants, and the Company is restating previously filed financial statements in
this Form 10-K. These adjustments, after tax, amounted to $4
million, $7 million, and $10 million in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The adjustment to 2006 was recorded in the fourth quarter of
fiscal year 2006 due to its insignificance.


The independent counsel and its forensic accountants (Investigative
Team) reviewed the facts and circumstances surrounding stock option grants
made on 259 dates. Based on a review of the totality of evidence and the
applicable law, the Special Committee found no misconduct by current
management. The Special Committees investigation identified a number of grants
for which grant dates were intentionally selected in order to obtain favorable
exercise prices. The terms of these and certain other grants, as discussed
below, were finalized after the originally assigned grant dates. The Special
Committee concluded that the procedures for granting, accounting for, and
reporting stock option grants did not include sufficient safeguards to prevent
manipulation. Although the investigation found that CEO Steve Jobs was aware or
recommended the selection of some favorable grant dates, he did not receive or financially
benefit from these grants or appreciate the accounting implications. The
Special Committee also found that the investigation had raised serious concerns
regarding the actions of two former officers in connection with the accounting,
recording and reporting of stock option grants.


Based on the evidence and findings from the Companys
internal review and the Special Committees independent investigation, an
analysis was performed of the measurement dates for the 42,077 stock option
grants made on 259 dates between October 1996 and January 2003 (the relevant
period). The Company believes that the analysis was properly limited to the
relevant period. In addition to analyzing all grants made during the relevant
period, the Company sampled certain grants between 1994 and 1997 and found none
that required accounting adjustments. The first grants for which stock-based
compensation expense is required are dated December 29, 1997. The Company
also examined grants made after the relevant period and found none that
required accounting adjustments. Moreover, in the years after 2002, Apple made
significant changes in its stock option granting practices in response to
evolving legal, regulatory and accounting requirements.


Consistent with the accounting literature and recent
guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the grants during
the relevant period were organized into categories based on grant 


85
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 2Restatement
of Consolidated Financial Statements
 (Continued)


type and process by which the grant was finalized. The
Company analyzed the evidence related to each category of grants including, but
not limited to, electronic and physical documents, document metadata, and
witness interviews. Based on the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company
applied the controlling accounting standards to determine, for every grant
within each category, the proper measurement date. If the measurement date is
not the originally assigned grant date, accounting adjustments were made as
required, resulting in stock-based compensation expense and related tax
effects.


The 42,077 grants were classified as follows: (1) 17
grants to persons elected or appointed to the Board of Directors (director
grants); (2) 3,892 grants to employees under the Monday/Tuesday Plan
described below (Monday/Tuesday grants); (3) 27,096 grants made in
broad-based awards to large numbers of employees, usually on an annual basis (focal
grants); (4) 9,988 other grants ratified at meetings of the Board or
Compensation Committee (meeting grants); (5) 1,082 other grants ratified
by unanimous written consent (UWC) of the Board or Compensation Committee (other
UWC grants); and (6) two grants to the CEO (CEO grants). All references
to the number of option shares, option exercise prices, and share prices in
this Note 2 have not been adjusted for any subsequent stock splits.


With the exception of director grants, all stock
option grants were subject to ratification by the Board or Compensation
Committee at a meeting or by UWC. Following approval of the grants at a meeting
or by UWC, the Companys legal staff would prepare a Secretarys Certificate
certifying the ratification of the grants. Based on the facts and circumstances
described below, the Company has concluded that the recipients and terms of
certain grants were fixed for accounting purposes before ratification pursuant
to parameters previously approved by the Board or Compensation Committee
through the Monday/Tuesday Plan and the focal process. As further discussed
below, within these parameters, management had the authority to determine the
recipients and terms for each grant. Thus, the Company has concluded that the
measurement dates for these grants occurred when managements process for
allocating these grants was completed and the grants were ready for
ratification, which was considered perfunctory. With regard to all other
grants, the Company has concluded that the grants were finalized and the
measurement dates occurred when the grants were ratified. For many grants,
however, the dates of ratification cannot be established because the dates the UWCs
were executed by the Board or Compensation Committee members or received by the
Company are not available. For such grants, the Company has concluded that the
date of the preparation of the Secretarys Certificate is the best alternative
for determining the actual date of ratification.


As discussed below, the Companys analysis determined
that the originally assigned grant dates for 6,428 grants on 42 dates are not
the proper measurement dates. Accordingly, after accounting for forfeitures,
the Company has recognized stock-based compensation expense of $105 million on
a pre-tax basis over the respective awards vesting terms. No adjustments were
required for the remaining 35,649 grants. The adjustments were determined by
category as follows:


Director GrantsSeventeen director grants were made
during the relevant period. Two director grants were made pursuant to a 1997
plan that dated the grants on the enactment of the plan. The remaining fifteen
grants were automatically made under the Director Stock Option Plan for
non-employee directors, which was approved by shareholders in 1998, on the date
of a directors election or appointment to the Board and on subsequent
anniversaries, beginning on the fourth anniversary. Accordingly, the analysis
determined that the originally assigned grant date for each director grant is
the measurement date, and no accounting adjustments are required.


86
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 2Restatement
of Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)


Monday/Tuesday GrantsBeginning in December 1998,
3,892 new hire grants and grants for promotion and retention purposes (promotion/retention
grants) were made during the relevant period under the Monday/Tuesday Plan. Under
the Monday/Tuesday Plan, new hire grants made within pre-established guidelines
approved by the Board or Compensation Committee were dated on the Monday that
the recipient started work (or the following Monday, if the recipient started
on another day). The Companys analysis showed this process to be reliable with
very low error rates. Promotion/retention grants, also based on pre-established
guidelines, were made generally on the first Tuesday of each month. The Company
has concluded that the new hire and promotion/retention grants made pursuant to
the Monday/Tuesday Plan within pre-established guidelines do not require
adjustment, with the exception of six grants that were erroneously dated before
the employees start dates. For 120 new hire and promotion/retention grants
made outside the guidelines, however, the Company has concluded that the
measurement dates are the dates of ratification by the Board or Compensation
Committee rather than the dates used for grants within guidelines. Accordingly,
based on the methodology described above, the Company has recognized
stock-based compensation expense of $6 million from 126 grants.


Focal GrantsDuring the relevant period, 27,096 focal
grants were made to employees typically on an annual basis as part of an
extensive process that required several months to complete. Pursuant to limits,
guidelines and practices previously approved by the Board or Compensation Committee,
managers throughout the Company would make recommendations for grants to
employees in their areas of responsibility. After senior management had
determined that the grants were made in accordance with these established
limits, guidelines and practices, management treated the grants as final when
they were submitted to the Board or Compensation Committee for ratification. The
Company has concluded that for 5,595 grants on five dates, the originally
assigned grant dates are not the proper measurement dates. For these grants,
managements process for finalizing the grants was completed after the originally
assigned grant dates. As a result, the Company has recognized $29 million of
stock-based compensation expense. For two of the five grant dates comprising
3,744 grants, the evidence shows that the grants were finalized and the
measurement date occurred one day after the originally assigned grant dates. The
grants on these two dates represent more than $16 million of the total $29
million of stock-based compensation expense resulting from focal grants.


Other Meeting GrantsDuring the relevant period,
meetings of the Board or Compensation Committee were held to ratify 9,988
grants that are not Monday/Tuesday, focal or CEO grants. The grant dates and
measurement dates for these grants are the meeting dates when the grants were
ratified, with the exception of 46 grants. Forty-two of these 46 grants are
dated concurrent with a meeting that considered and approved certain grants,
but the evidence indicates that all of the grants may not have been finalized
until a later date. One of the 46 grants was approved and dated at another
meeting, but the recipient, who was becoming employed by the Company as part of
a corporate acquisition, did not start until a later date. Two other grants
were approved before the employees start dates. Another grant was mistakenly
cancelled and subsequently reinstated, requiring an accounting adjustment.
Thus, for these 46 grants the Company has concluded that the originally assigned
grant dates are not the proper measurement dates. As a result, the Company has
recognized $2 million of stock-based compensation expense.


Other UWC GrantsDuring the relevant period, 1,082
grants were approved by UWCs for a variety of purposes, including executive
recruitment, retention, promotion and new hires outside the Monday/Tuesday
process. These grants were not made pursuant to pre-established guidelines
adopted by the Board or Compensation Committee. Therefore, the Company has
concluded that these grants were 


87
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 2Restatement
of Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)


not finalized for accounting purposes until
ratification by the Board or Compensation Committee. Accordingly, for 660
grants, the Company has concluded that the originally assigned grant dates are
not the proper measurement dates. As a result, the Company has recognized $48
million of stock-based compensation expense.


CEO GrantsDuring the relevant period, the Company
made two grants to CEO Steve Jobs. The first grant, dated January 12,
2000, was for 10 million option shares. The second grant, dated October 19,
2001, was for 7.5 million option shares. Both grants were cancelled in March 2003
prior to being exercised, when Mr. Jobs received 5 million shares of
restricted stock.


With respect to the grant dated January 12, 2000,
the Board on December 2, 1999, authorized a special CEO Compensation
Committee to grant Mr. Jobs up to 15 million shares. The evidence
indicates that the CEO Compensation Committee finalized the terms of the grant
on January 12, 2000, although the Committees action was memorialized in a
UWC transmitted on January 18, 2000. Because the measurement date is the originally
assigned grant date, the Company has not recognized any stock-based
compensation expense from this grant. If the Company had determined that the
measurement date was the date when the UWC was executed or received, then
additional stock-based compensation would have been recognized.


The grant dated October 19, 2001 was originally
approved at a Board meeting on August 29, 2001, with an exercise price of
$17.83. The terms of the grant, however, were not finalized until December 18,
2001. The grant was dated October 19, 2001, with an exercise price of
$18.30. The approval for the grant was improperly recorded as occurring at a
special Board meeting on October 19, 2001. Such a special Board meeting
did not occur. There was no evidence, however, that any current member of
management was aware of this irregularity. The Company has recognized $20
million in stock-based compensation expense for this grant, reflecting the
difference between the exercise price of $18.30 and the share price on December 18,
2001 of $21.01.

investigation of past stock option grants is as follows (dollars in millions):

net unrealized losses totaling $687,000 on its investment portfolio, primarily
related to investments with stated maturities less than 1 year, as of September 30,
2006, and net unrealized losses of $5.9 million on its investment portfolio,
approximately half of which related to investments with stated maturities less
than 1 year, as of September 24, 2005. The Company may sell its

The Company recognized net losses before taxes of $434,000 and $137,000 in 2006
and 2005, respectively, and a net gain before taxes of $1 million in 2004 as a
result of such sales. These net gains were included in interest and other
income, net.


As of September 30,
2006 and September 24, 2005, approximately $921 million and $287 million,
respectively, of the Companys short-term investments had underlying maturities
ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remaining short-term investments as of September 30,

The unrealized losses on
the Companys investments during 2006 in U.S. Government securities and during
2005 in U.S. Government securities, U.S. corporate securities, and foreign
securities were caused primarily by changes in interest rates. The Company
typically invests in highly-rated securities with low probabilities of default.
The Companys investment policy requires investments to be rated single-A or
better. Therefore, the Company considers the declines to be temporary in nature.
As of September 30, 2006, the Company does not consider the investments to
be other-than-temporarily impaired.


Market values were
determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When
evaluating the investments for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company
reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has
been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, and the Companys
ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time, which may be
sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value.

Accounts Receivable


Trade Receivables


The Company distributes its products through
third-party distributors and resellers and directly to certain education,
consumer, and commercial customers. The Company generally does not require
collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral in
certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company
does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance
for certain customers in Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Australia and by
arranging with third-party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements
and other loan and lease programs to the Companys direct customers. These
credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing
company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume
any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.
However, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral,
third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the
Companys distribution and retail channel partners. No customer accounted for
more than 10% of trade receivables as of September 30, 2006 or September 24,
2005.

Vendor Non-Trade
Receivables


The Company has non-trade
receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale
of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture
sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company
purchases these raw material components directly from suppliers. These
non-trade receivables, which are included in the consolidated balance sheets in
other current assets, totaled $1.6 billion and $417 million as of September 30,
2006 and September 24, 2005, respectively. The Company does not reflect
the sale of these components in net sales and does not recognize any profits on
these sales until the products are sold through to the end customer at which
time the profit is recognized as a reduction of cost of sales.


Derivative
Financial Instruments


The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its
business exposure to foreign exchange risk. Foreign currency forward and option
contracts are used to offset the foreign exchange risk on certain existing
assets and liabilities and to hedge the foreign exchange risk on expected
future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales. From time to
time, the Company enters into interest rate derivative agreements to modify the
interest rate profile of certain investments and debt. The Companys accounting
policies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are
designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. The Company records all
derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.

The notional principal amounts for derivative
instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of
year-end, and do not represent the amount of the Companys exposure to credit
or market loss. The credit risk amounts shown in the table above represents the
Companys gross exposure to potential accounting loss on these transactions if
all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract,
based on then-current currency exchange rates at each respective date.
The Companys exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a
function of currency exchange rates.


The estimates of fair
value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models and prevailing
financial market information as of September 30, 2006 and September 24,
2005. Although the table above reflects the notional principal, fair value, and
credit risk amounts of the Companys foreign exchange instruments, it does not
reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that
the foreign exchange instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately
realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the
gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market
conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.


Foreign Exchange
Risk Management


The Company may enter into foreign currency forward
and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign
exchange risk associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly
committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in
foreign subsidiaries. Generally, the Companys practice is to hedge a majority
of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the
Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to
immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, or
limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments.


To help protect gross margins from fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates, the Companys U.S. dollar functional
subsidiaries hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and the
Companys non-U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries selling in local currencies
hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the
subsidiaries functional currency. Other comprehensive income 


94
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 3Financial
Instruments (Continued)


associated with hedges of foreign currency revenue is
recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related sales
are recognized, and other comprehensive income related to inventory purchases
is recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related
costs are recognized. Typically, the Company hedges portions of its forecasted
foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases over
a time horizon of up to 6 months.


Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges
must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable that the forecasted hedged
transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a
subsequent 2 month time period. Deferred gains and losses in other
comprehensive income associated with such derivative instruments are
immediately reclassified into earnings in other income and expense. Any
subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are also
reflected in current earnings unless they are re-designated as hedges of other
transactions. The Company recognized a net gain of approximately $421,000 in
2006 and net losses of $1.6 million and $2.8 million in 2005 and 2004,
respectively, in other income and expense related to the loss of hedge
designation on discontinued cash flow hedges due to changes in the Companys
forecast of future net sales and cost of sales and due to prevailing market
conditions. As of September 30, 2006, the Company had a net deferred gain
associated with cash flow hedges of approximately $2.8 million, net of taxes,
substantially all of which is expected to be reclassified to earnings by the
end of the second quarter of fiscal 2007.


The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a
derivative instrument designated as a net investment hedge is included in the
cumulative translation adjustment account of accumulated other comprehensive
income within shareholders equity. For the years ended September 30, 2006
and September 24, 2005, the Company had net gains of $7.4 million and
$673,000, respectively, included in the cumulative translation adjustment.


The Company may also enter
into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign
exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and
liabilities recorded in non-functional currencies. Changes in the fair value of
these derivatives are recognized in current earnings in other income and
expense as offsets to the changes in the fair value of the related assets or
liabilities. Due to currency market movements, changes in option time value can
lead to increased volatility in other income and expense.

As of September 30, 2006, and September 24,
2005, the weighted-average amortization period for acquired technology was 8.5
years and 5.5 years, respectively.


During 2006, the Company sold certain assets related
to its PowerSchool web-based student information system operations. In
connection with this sale, the Company reduced goodwill by $31 million for the
outstanding balance from the acquisition of PowerSchool, Inc. in 2001 and
recognized a $4 million pre-tax gain, which is reflected in other income and
expense in the consolidated statement of operations.


During 2005, the Company recorded an adjustment of
approximately $11 million to goodwill relating to a reduction of valuation
allowances that were recorded at the time certain net operating loss
carryforwards (NOLs) were acquired in previous business combinations. During
2005, these NOLs were deemed to be more likely than not to be realized and
accordingly the valuation allowances were reversed against the related goodwill
that was recognized at the time of the acquisitions.

Charges


During 2004, the Company
recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $23.0 million, including
approximately $14.0 million in severance costs, $5.5 million in asset
impairments, and $3.5 million for lease cancellations. The lease cancellations
relate to vacating a leased sales facility from a European workforce reduction
during 2004. Of the $23.0 million charges, $21.3 million had been utilized by
the end of 2006, with the remainder consisting of $1.7 million for lease
cancellations. These actions have resulted in the termination of 452 positions.

The foreign provision for income taxes is based on
foreign pretax earnings of approximately $1.5 billion, $922 million, and $384
million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. As of September 30, 2006, 


98
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 7Income
Taxes
 (Continued)


approximately $4.1 billion of the Companys cash, cash
equivalents, and short-term investments were held by foreign subsidiaries
and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held
by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on
repatriation to the U.S. The Companys consolidated financial statements
provide for any related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated, aside
from undistributed earnings of certain of the Companys foreign subsidiaries
that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the U.S.
U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $823 million
of such earnings. It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability
that might be incurred if these earnings were to be distributed.


On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation
Act of 2004 (AJCA) was signed into law. The AJCA included a provision for the
deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that were repatriated, as defined
in the AJCA, within a specified time frame. Among other requirements, dividends
qualifying for the 85% deduction must be reinvested in the United States in
certain qualified investments pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan approved
by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Board of Directors. During 2006, the
Company repatriated approximately $1.6 billion of foreign earnings. Of the
earnings repatriated, $755 million is eligible for the reduced tax rate
provided by the AJCA. Accordingly, the Company recorded a tax charge of $51
million related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the provisions of
the AJCA. In addition, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $71 million
resulting from the implementation of tax planning strategies to recognize
deferred tax assets that were previously not recognizable within certain
foreign subsidiaries.


Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the
effects of tax losses, credits, and the future income tax effects of temporary
differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured
using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

Note 7Income
Taxes (Continued)


As of September 30, 2006, the Company has state
and foreign tax loss and state credit carryforwards, the tax effect of which is
$55 million. Certain of those carryforwards, the tax effect of which is $12
million, expire between 2016 
a
nd 2019. A
portion of these carryforwards was acquired from the Companys previous
acquisitions, the utilization of which is subject to certain limitations
imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The remaining benefits from tax losses
and credits do not expire. As of September 30, 2006 and September 24,
2005, a valuation allowance of $5 million was recorded against the deferred tax
asset for the benefits of state operating losses that may not be realized. Management
believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income
that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together
with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to
fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets.


A

The Companys income taxes
payable has been reduced by the tax benefits from employee stock options. The
Company receives an income tax benefit calculated as the difference between the
fair market value of the stock issued at the time of the exercise and the
option price, tax effected. The net tax benefits from employee stock option
transactions were $419 million, $428 million (as restated(1)), and $83 million
(as restated(1)) in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, and were reflected as
an increase to common stock in the consolidated statements of shareholders
equity.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 7Income
Taxes (Continued)


The Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) has substantially completed its field audit of the Companys
federal income tax returns for the years 2002 through 2003 and proposed certain
adjustments. The Company intends to contest certain of these adjustments
through the IRS Appeals Office. Substantially all IRS audit issues for years
prior to 2002 have been resolved. In addition, the Company is also subject to
audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities. Management believes that
adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax
examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with
certainty. Should any issues addressed in the Companys tax audits be resolved
in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the Company could be
required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution
occurs. In 2006, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $20 million due to
the settlement of prior year tax audits in the U.S.


Note 8Shareholders
Equity


Preferred Stock


The Company has five
million shares of authorized preferred stock, none of which is outstanding.
Under the terms of the Companys Restated Articles of Incorporation, the Board
of Directors is authorized to determine or alter the rights, preferences,
privileges, and restrictions of the Companys authorized but unissued shares of
preferred stock.


Restricted Stock Units


The Companys Board of Directors has granted
restricted stock units to members of the Companys senior management team,
excluding its CEO. These restricted stock units generally vest over four years
either at the end of the four-year service period, in two equal installments on
the second and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant, or in equal
installments on each of the first through fourth anniversaries of the grant
date. Upon vesting, the restricted stock units will convert into an equivalent
number of shares of common stock. The amounts of the restricted stock units
expensed by the Company are based on the closing market price of the Companys
common stock on the date of grant and are amortized on a straight-line basis
over the four-year requisite service period. The restricted stock units have
been reflected in the calculation of diluted earnings per share utilizing the
treasury stock method.


2.47 million previously
granted restricted stock units vested during 2006. A majority of these vested
restricted stock units were net-share settled such that the Company withheld
shares with value equivalent to the employees minimum statutory obligation for
the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the
appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld of 985,833 for 2006
was based on the value of the restricted stock units on their vesting date as
determined by the Companys closing stock price. Total payments for the
employees tax obligations to the taxing authorities were approximately $59 million.
These net-share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the Company
as they reduced and retired the number of shares that would have otherwise been
issued as a result of the vesting and did not represent an expense to the
Company.


CEO Restricted Stock Award


On March 19, 2003,
the Companys Board of Directors granted 10 million shares of restricted stock
to the Companys CEO that vested on March 19, 2006. The amount of the
restricted stock award expensed by the Company was based on the closing market
price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant and was amortized on a
straight-line basis over the three-year requisite service period.


101
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 8Shareholders
Equity
 (Continued)


Upon vesting during 2006,
the restricted stock award was net-share settled such that the Company withheld
shares with value equivalent to the CEOs minimum statutory obligation for the
applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the
appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld of 4.6 million was
based on the value of the restricted stock award on the vesting date as
determined by the Companys closing stock price of $64.66. The remaining shares
net of those withheld were delivered to the Companys CEO. Total payments for
the CEOs tax obligations to the taxing authorities were approximately $296
million. The net-share settlement had the effect of share repurchases by the
Company as it reduced and retired the number of shares outstanding and did not
represent an expense to the Company.


Stock Repurchase Plan


In July 1999, the
Companys Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up
to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does not obligate the
Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any
specified period of time. The Company has repurchased a total of 13.1 million
shares at a cost of $217 million under this plan and was authorized to
repurchase up to an additional $283 million of its common stock as of September 30,
2006.


Comprehensive Income


Comprehensive income consists of two components: net
income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to
revenue, expenses, gains, and losses that under U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders equity but
are excluded from net income. The Companys other comprehensive income consists
of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using
the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on
marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains
and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges.

Employee Benefit Plans


2003 Employee Stock Plan


The 2003 Employee Stock
Plan (the 2003 Plan) is a shareholder approved plan that provides for
broad-based grants to employees, including executive officers. Based on the
terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 2003 Plan
generally expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and generally become
exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment, with
either annual or quarterly vesting. The 2003 Plan permits the granting of
incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock units,
stock appreciation rights, and stock purchase rights.


1997 Employee Stock Option Plan


In August 1997, the
Companys Board of Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 1997
Plan), a non-shareholder approved plan for grants of stock options to employees
who are not officers of the Company. Based on the terms of individual option
grants, options granted under the 1997 Plan generally expire 7 to 10 years
after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years,
based on continued employment, with either annual or quarterly vesting. In October 2003,
the Company terminated the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan and cancelled all
remaining unissued shares totaling 28,590,702. No new options can be granted
from the 1997 Plan.


Employee Stock Option Exchange Program


On March 20, 2003,
the Company announced a voluntary employee stock option exchange program (the Exchange
Program) whereby eligible employees, other than executive officers and members
of the Board of Directors, had an opportunity to exchange outstanding options
with exercise prices at or above $12.50 per share for a predetermined smaller
number of new stock options issued with exercise prices equal to the fair
market value of one share of the Companys common stock on the day the new
awards were issued, which was to be at least six months plus one day after the
exchange options were cancelled. On April 17, 2003, in accordance with the
Exchange Program, the Company cancelled options to purchase 33,138,386 shares
of its common stock. On October 22, 2003, new stock options totaling
13,394,736 shares were issued to employees at an exercise price of $11.38 per
share, which is equivalent to the closing price of the Companys stock on that
date. No financial or accounting impact to the Companys financial position,
results of operations or cash flows was associated with this transaction.

1997 Director Stock Option Plan


In August 1997, the
Companys Board of Directors adopted a Director Stock Option Plan (Director
Plan) for non-employee directors of the Company, which was approved by
shareholders in 1998. 
Pursuant to the
Director Plan, the Companys non-employee directors are granted an option to
acquire 30,000 shares of Common Stock upon their initial election to the Board
(Initial Options

). The Initial Options vest and
become exercisable in three equal annual installments on each of the first
through third anniversaries of the grant date. On the fourth anniversary of a
non-employee directors initial election to the Board and on each subsequent
anniversary thereafter, the director will be entitled to receive an option to
acquire 10,000 shares of Common Stock (Annual Options). Annual Options are
fully vested and immediately exercisable on their date of grant.


Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans


Certain of the Companys
executive officers, including Mr. Timothy D. Cook, Mr. Peter
Oppenheimer, Mr. Philip W. Schiller, and Dr. Bertrand Serlet, have
entered into trading plans pursuant to Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. A trading plan is a written
document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for
determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the
Companys stock including the exercise and sale of employee stock options and
shares acquired pursuant to the Companys employee stock purchase plan and upon
vesting of restricted stock units.


Employee Stock Purchase Plan


The Company has a
shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan (the Purchase Plan), under
which substantially all employees may purchase common stock through payroll
deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values as of
the beginning and end of six month offering periods. Stock purchases under the
Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of an employees compensation, up to a maximum
of $25,000 in any calendar year. The number of shares authorized for issuance
is limited to a total of 1 million shares per offering period. During 2006,
2005, and 2004, adjusted for the February 2005 stock split, 1.5 million,
2.3 million, and 3.9 million shares, respectively, were issued under the
Purchase Plan. As of September 30, 2006, approximately 2.3 million shares
were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan.


Employee Savings Plan


The Company has an employee savings plan (the Savings
Plan) qualifying as a deferred salary arrangement under
Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the Savings Plan,
participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up
to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limit ($15,000 for calendar
year 2006). The Company matches 50% to 100% of each employees contributions,
depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employees earnings.
The Companys matching contributions to the Savings Plan were approximately $33
million, $28 million, and $24 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004,
respectively.

In conjunction with the amendments to the 2003 Plan
that were approved at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on April 21,
2005, the number of shares available for grant under the 2003 Plan will be
reduced by two times the number of restricted shares and restricted stock units
granted. This amendment is effective for all grants made after April 21,
2005.


Aggregate intrinsic value represents the value of the
Companys closing stock price on the last trading day of the fiscal period in
excess of the exercise price multiplied by the number of options outstanding or
exercisable. Total intrinsic value of options at time of exercise was $1.2
billion, $1.1 billion, and $266.9 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004,
respectively.


As of September 30, 2006, the Company had 3.41
million restricted stock units outstanding with a total grant-date fair value
of $135.1 million that were excluded from the options outstanding balances in
the preceding table. The weighted-average grant date fair value of restricted
stock units granted during 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $70.92, $45.04, and $12.81,
respectively. Aggregate intrinsic value of unvested restricted stock units at September 30,
2006 was $262.5 million. Restricted stock units that vested during 2006 totaled
2.47 million and had a fair value of $148.5 million as of the vesting date. Granted
restricted stock units have been deducted from the shares available for grant
under the Companys stock option plans.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 8Shareholders'
Equity (Continued)


The number of shares of restricted
stock that vested during 2006 was 10 million, which had a fair value of $646.6
million. The grant-date fair value of restricted stock that fully vested during
2006 was $7.48 per share. For the years ended September 30, 2006, September 24,
2005, and September 25, 2004, compensation expense related to restricted
stock was $4.6 million, $24.9 million, and $24.9 million, respectively.


Note 9Stock-Based
Compensation


The Company has provided pro forma disclosures in Note
1 of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the effect on net
income and earnings per share for the years ended September 24, 2005 and September 25,
2004 as if the fair value method of accounting for stock compensation had been
used for its employee stock option grants and employee stock purchase plan
purchases. These pro forma effects have been estimated at the date of grant and
beginning of the period, respectively, using the BSM option pricing model.


The
weighted average assumptions used for 2006, 2005, and 2004 and the resulting estimates
of weighted-average fair value per share of options granted and for stock
purchases during those periods are as follows:

Pursuant to SFAS No. 123R,
the expected volatility assumptions used by the Company are based on the
historical volatility of the Companys common stock over the most recent period
commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Companys stock options
and other relevant factors including implied volatility in market traded
options on the Companys common stock. The Company bases its expected life
assumption on its historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the
stock options it grants to employees.


Note 10Commitments and
Contingencies


Lease Commitments


The Company leases various equipment and facilities,
including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The
Company does not currently utilize any other off-balance-sheet financing
arrangements. The major facility leases are for terms of 5 to 15 years and
generally provide

renewal options for
terms of 3 to 5 additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms of 5 to
20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year
renewal options. As of September 30, 2006, the Companys total future
minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were approximately
$1.2 billion, of which $887 million related to leases for retail space.


Rent
expense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable
leases, was $138 million, $140 million, and $103 million in 2006, 2005, and
2004, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating
leases having remaining terms in excess of one year as of September 30,
2006, are as follows (in millions):

Accrued Warranty
and Indemnifications


The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor
warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period for hardware
products is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. The
Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to
repair the Companys hardware products. The Company provides currently for the
estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product warranties
at the time related revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining
appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the
installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical and
projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and
knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Companys
typical experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting
warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual
experience and changes in future estimates.


The Company periodically provides updates to its
applications and system software to maintain the softwares compliance with
specifications. The estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for as
warranty costs that are recognized at the time related software revenue is
recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to
such updates include the number of units delivered, the number of updates
expected to occur, and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the
resources necessary to develop these updates.

Note 10Commitments
and Contingencies (Continued)


The
Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and
application software against legal claims that the software infringes
third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the
Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company
could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim
against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not
been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an
infringement claim asserted against itself or an indemnified third-party and,
in the opinion of management, does not have a potential liability related to
unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a
material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of
operations. Therefore, the Company did not record a liability for infringement
costs as of either September 30, 2006 or September 24, 2005.


Concentrations in
the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product


Although most components
essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple
sources, other key components (including microprocessors and application-specific
integrated circuits (ASICs)) are currently obtained by the Company from
single or limited sources. Some other key components, while currently available
to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide
availability and pricing pressures. In addition, the Company uses some
components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry,
and new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom
components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated
whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers. If
the supply of a key single-sourced component to the Company were to be
delayed or curtailed, or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays
shipments of completed products to the Company, the Companys ability to ship
related products in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely
affected. The Companys business and financial performance could also be
adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient
quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient
quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these
components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the
production of common components instead of components customized to meet the
Companys requirements. Finally, significant portions of the Companys CPUs,
logic boards, and assembled products are now manufactured by outsourcing
partners, primarily in various parts of Asia. Although the Company works
closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Companys
operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were
unable to meet their production obligations.


Long-Term Supply
Agreements


During 2006, the Company
entered into long-term supply agreements with Hynix Semiconductor, Inc.,
Intel Corporation, Micron Technology, Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.,
and Toshiba Corporation to secure supply of NAND flash memory through calendar
year 2010. As part of these agreements, the Company prepaid $1.25 billion for
flash memory components during 2006. These prepayments will be applied to
inventory purchases made over the life of each respective agreement.


Contingencies


The Company is subject to certain other legal
proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and
have not been fully adjudicated. In the opinion of management, the Company does
not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and
claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse
effect on its financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations. 


108
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 10Commitments
and Contingencies (Continued)


However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be
predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these
legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the
Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular
reporting period could be materially adversely affected.


Production and marketing
of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to
environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the
requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of
its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or
recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been passed
in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates including various
European Union member countries, Japan and certain states within the U.S. Although
the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future
based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no
assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material
adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, liquidity, or results of
operations.


Note 11Segment
Information and Geographic Data


In accordance with SFAS No. 131, 
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information
,
the Company reports segment information based on the management approach. The
management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for
making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Companys
reportable segments.


The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic
basis. The Companys reportable operating segments are comprised of the
Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas, Europe, and Japan reportable
segments do not include activities related to the Retail segment. The Americas
segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes
European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Retail segment
operates Apple-owned retail stores in the U.S., Canada, Japan, and the U.K. Other
operating segments include Asia-Pacific, which includes Australia and Asia
except for Japan, and the Companys subsidiary, FileMaker, Inc. Each
reportable geographic operating segment provides similar hardware and software
products and similar services, and the accounting policies of the various
segments are the same as those described in Note 1, Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies, except as described below for the Retail segment.


The Company evaluates the performance of its operating
segments based on net sales. The Retail segments performance is also evaluated
based on operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally
based on the location of the customers. Operating income for each segment
includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses
directly attributable to the segment. Operating income for each segment
excludes other income and expense and certain expenses that are managed outside
the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include
various corporate expenses such as manufacturing costs and variances not
included in standard costs, research and development, corporate marketing
expenses, stock-based compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring
charges, and other separately managed general and administrative expenses
including certain corporate expenses associated with support of the Retail
segment. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments
for management reporting purposes. Segment assets exclude corporate assets.
Corporate assets include cash, short-term and long-term investments,
manufacturing facilities, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and
other acquired intangible assets, and retail store construction-in-progress
that is not subject to depreciation. Except for the Retail segment, capital 


109
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 11Segment
Information and Geographic Data
 (Continued)


expenditures for long-lived assets are not reported to
management by segment. Capital expenditures by the Retail segment were $200
million, $132 million, and $104 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004,
respectively.Operating income for all segments, except Retail, includes cost of
sales at manufacturing standard cost, other cost of sales, related sales and
marketing costs, and certain general and administrative costs. This measure of
operating income, which includes manufacturing profit, provides a comparable
basis for comparison between the Companys various geographic segments. Certain
manufacturing expenses and related adjustments not included in segment cost of
sales, including variances between standard and actual manufacturing costs and
the mark-up above standard cost for product supplied to the Retail segment, are
included in corporate expenses.


Management assesses the operating performance of the
Retail segment differently than it assesses the operating performance of the
Companys geographic segments. The Retail segment revenue and operating income
is intended to depict a measure comparable to that of the Companys major
channel partners in the U.S. operating retail stores so the Company can
evaluate the Retail segment performance as if it were a channel partner.
Therefore, the Company makes three significant adjustments to the Retail
segment for management reporting purposes that are not included in the results
of the Companys other segments.


First, the Retail segments operating income includes
cost of sales for Apple products at an amount normally charged to major channel
partners in the U.S. operating retail stores, less the cost of sales programs
and incentives provided to those channel partners and the Companys cost to
support those partners. For the years ended September 30, 2006, September 24,
2005, and September 25, 2004, this resulted in the recognition of
additional cost of sales above standard cost by the Retail segment and an
offsetting benefit to corporate expenses of approximately $663 million, $435
million, and $213 million, respectively.


Second, the Companys service and support contracts
are transferred to the Retail segment at the same cost as that charged to the
Companys major retail channel partners in the U.S., resulting in a measure of
revenue and gross margin for those items that is comparable between the Companys
retail stores and those retail channel partners. The Retail segment recognizes
the full amount of revenue and cost of sales of the Companys service and
support contracts at the time of sale. Because the Company has not yet earned
the revenue or incurred the costs associated with the sale of these contracts,
an offset to these amounts is recognized in other operating segments net sales
and cost of sales. For the year ended September 30, 2006, this resulted in
the recognition of net sales and cost of sales by the Retail segment, with
corresponding offsets in other operating segments, of $159 million and $109
million, respectively. For the year ended September 24, 2005, this
resulted in the recognition of net sales and cost of sales by the Retail
segment of $92 million and $64 million, respectively. For the year ended September 25,
2004, this resulted in the recognition of net sales and cost of sales by the
Retail segment of $54 million and $37 million, respectively.


Third, the Company had opened a total of eight
high-profile stores as of September 30, 2006. These high-profile stores
are larger than the Companys typical retail stores and were designed to
further promote brand awareness and provide a venue for certain corporate sales
and marketing activities, including corporate briefings. As such, the Company
allocates certain operating expenses associated with these stores to corporate
marketing expense to reflect the estimated benefit realized Company-wide. The
allocation of these operating costs is based on the amount incurred for a high-profile
store in excess of that incurred by a more typical Company retail location.
Expenses allocated to corporate marketing resulting

from the operations
of these stores were $33 million, $31 million, and $16 million for the years

Note 12Related Party
Transactions and Certain Other Transactions


In March 2002, the Company entered into a
Reimbursement Agreement with its CEO, Steve Jobs, for the reimbursement of
expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs in the operation of his private plane when
used for Company business. The Reimbursement Agreement became effective for
expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs for Company business purposes since he took
delivery of the plane in May 2001. The Company recognized a total of
$202,000, $1,100,000, and $483,000 in expenses pursuant to the Reimbursement
Agreement during 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. All expenses recognized
pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement have been included in selling, general,
and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.


In 2006, the Company
entered into an agreement with Pixar to sell certain of Pixars short films on
the iTunes Store. Mr. Jobs was the CEO, Chairman, and a large shareholder
of Pixar. On May 5, 2006, The Walt Disney Company (Disney) acquired
Pixar, which resulted in Pixar becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Disney.
Upon Disneys acquisition of Pixar, Mr. Jobs shares of Pixar common stock
were exchanged for Disneys common stock and he was elected to the Disney Board
of Directors. Royalty expense recognized by the Company under the arrangement
with Pixar from September 25, 2005 through May 5, 2006 was less than
$1 million.

The impact of the stock-based compensation adjustments
was not significant to any of the interim balance sheets for fiscal year 2005.


Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed
independently for each of the quarters presented. Therefore, the sum of
quarterly basic and diluted per share information may not equal annual basic

Net income during the fourth quarter of 2005 benefited
by $81 million from the reversal of certain tax contingency reserves and
adjustments to net deferred tax assets, including reductions to valuation
allowances.

R
eport of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Apple Computer, Inc.:


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Apple Computer, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30,
2006 and September 24, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended September 30, 2006. These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.


We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.


In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of September 30, 2006 and September 24,
2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2006, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


As discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, the consolidated financial statements as of September 24, 2005
and for each of the years in the two-year period ended September 24, 2005
have been restated.


As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, effective September 25, 2005, the Company adopted the
provision of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised
2004), 
Share-Based Payment
.


We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2006, based
on criteria established in 
Internal
Control-Integrated Framework 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated December 29,
2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment of, and the
effective operation of internal control over financial reporting.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Apple Computer, Inc.:


We have audited managements assessment, included in
the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting, that Apple Computer, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2006, based
on criteria established in 
Internal Control-Integrated
Framework 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO). Apple Computer, Inc.s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Apple Computer, Inc.s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.


We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.


A companys internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.


Because of inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


In our opinion, managements assessment that Apple
Computer, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of September 30, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on criteria established in 
Internal
Control-Integrated Framework 
issued by COSO. Also, in our opinion,
Apple Computer, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2006, based
on criteria established in 
Internal
Control-Integrated Framework 
issued by COSO.


We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Apple Computer, Inc.
as of September 30, 2006 and September 24, 2005, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2006, and
our report dated December 29, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on
those consolidated financial statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


Note
1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies


Apple Computer, Inc.
and its subsidiaries (the Company) designs, manufactures, and markets personal
computers and related software, services, peripherals, and networking solutions.
The Company also designs, develops, and markets a line of portable digital
music players along with related accessories and services including the online
distribution of third-party music, audio books, music videos, short films, and
television shows. The Company sells its products worldwide through its online
stores, its own retail stores, its direct sales force, and third-party
wholesalers, resellers, and value-added resellers. In addition to its own
hardware, software, and peripheral products, the Company sells a variety of
third-party hardware and software products through its online and retail stores.
The Company sells to education, consumer, creative professional, business, and
government customers.


Basis
of Presentation and Preparation


The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company.
Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of
these consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from
those estimates. Certain prior year amounts in the consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current
year presentation.


Typically, the Companys
fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of September. Fiscal years 2005, 2004,
and 2003 were each 52-week years. However, approximately every six years,
the Company reports a 53-week fiscal year to align its fiscal quarters
with calendar quarters by adding a week to its first fiscal quarter. The
Company will add this additional week in the first fiscal quarter of its fiscal
year 2006. All information presented herein is based on the Companys fiscal
calendar.


Common Stock Split


On February 28, 2005,
the Company effected a two-for-one stock split to shareholders of record as of February 18,
2005. All share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to
reflect the stock split.


Financial
Instruments


Cash Equivalents
and Short-term Investments


All highly liquid
investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are
classified as cash equivalents. Highly liquid investments with maturities
greater than three months are classified as short-term investments. The
Companys debt and marketable equity securities have been classified and
accounted for as available-for-sale. Management determines the
appropriate classification of its investments in debt and marketable equity
securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates available-for-sale
designation as of each balance sheet date. These securities are carried at fair
value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a
component of shareholders equity. The cost of securities sold is based upon
the specific identification method.


Derivative
Financial Instruments


The Company accounts for
its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at
fair value. Derivatives that are not defined as hedges in SFAS 133, 
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,

must be adjusted to fair value through earnings. If the derivative is a hedge,
depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value will either be
offset against the change in fair value of the


64
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 1Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies
 (Continued)


hedged assets,
liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings, or recognized in other
comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.


For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to
variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow
hedges, the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity and
reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the
hedged transaction affects earnings. To receive hedge accounting treatment,
cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected
future cash flows on hedged transactions. For derivative instruments that hedge
the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that
are designated as fair value hedges, the net gain or loss on the derivative
instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item
attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current
period. The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative
instrument that is designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency
translation exposure of the net investment in a foreign operation is reported
in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For forward
contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in
fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its
definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this
component are recognized in current earnings.


The Company may enter into
foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the translation and economic
exposure of a net investment position in a foreign subsidiary. For such
contracts, hedge effectiveness is measured based on changes in the fair value
of the contract attributable to changes in the spot exchange rate. The
effective portion of the net gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated
as a hedge of the net investment position in a foreign subsidiary is reported
in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. Any residual
changes in fair value of the forward contract, including changes in fair value
based on the differential between the spot and forward exchange rates, are
recognized in current earnings in other income and expense.


Inventories


Inventories are stated at
the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out method, or market. If
the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are made
currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. The Companys
inventories consist primarily of finished goods for all periods presented.


Property,
Plant, and Equipment


Property, plant, and
equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are 30 years for
buildings, up to 5 years for equipment, and the shorter of lease terms or 10
years for leasehold improvements. The Company capitalizes eligible costs to
acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the
preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software
are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the assets, which range from 3 to 5 years. Depreciation and amortization
expense on property and equipment was $141 million, $126 million, and $108
million during 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

Asset Retirement
Obligations


The Company records obligations associated with the
retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement
costs in accordance with SFAS No. 143, 
Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations
. The Company reviews legal obligations
associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the
acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. If it
is determined that a legal obligation exists, the fair value of the liability
for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is
incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of
the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this
additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. The
difference between the gross expected future cash flow and its present value is
accreted over the life of the related lease as an operating expense. All of the
Companys existing asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments
to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease
termination.

2004 and 2005 (in millions):

Cumulative
Effects of Accounting Changes


In 2003, the Company
recognized a net favorable cumulative effect type adjustment of approximately $1 million
from the adoption of SFAS No. 150, 
Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristic of Both Liabilities and Equity

and SFAS No. 143.


Long-Lived
Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets


The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment and
certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may
not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of
its carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected
to generate. If property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable
intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized
equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair
market value. For the three fiscal years ended September 24, 2005, the
Company had no material impairment of its long-lived assets, except for the
impairment of certain assets in connection with the restructuring actions
described in Note 5 of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.


SFAS No. 142, 
Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets
 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but rather be tested for
impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. The Company performs its
goodwill impairment tests on or about August 30 of each year. The Company
did not recognize any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in 2005,
2004, or 2003. The Company established reporting units based on its current
reporting structure. For purposes of testing goodwill for 


66
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 1Summary

impairment,
goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates
to each reporting unit.SFAS No. 142 also requires that intangible assets
with definite lives be amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed
for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, 
Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be
Disposed Of
. The Company is currently amortizing its acquired
intangible assets with definite lives over periods ranging from 3 to 10 years.


Foreign Currency Translation


The Company translates the
assets and liabilities of its international non-U.S. functional currency
subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each
period. Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates
that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these
translations are credited or charged to foreign currency translation included
in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders equity. The
Companys foreign manufacturing subsidiaries and certain other international
subsidiaries that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency remeasure
monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each
period, and inventories, property, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at
historical rates. Gains and losses from these translations were insignificant
and have been included in the Companys results of operations.


Revenue Recognition


Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale
of hardware, software, peripherals, digital content, and service and support
contracts. The Company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting
standards, including Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97-2, 
Software Revenue Recognition
, as amended, and Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, 
Revenue Recognition
.


The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is
fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered
delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss
have been transferred. For most of the Companys product sales, these criteria
are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals,
for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales,
the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the
Company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during
transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the
arrangement fee is not, or is presumed to not be, fixed or determinable,
revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and
payable.


Revenue from service and support contracts is deferred
and recognized ratably over the service coverage periods. These contracts
typically include extended phone support, repair services, web-based support resources,
diagnostic tools, and extend the service coverage offered under the Companys
one-year limited warranty.


The Company sells software and peripheral products
obtained from other companies. The Company establishes its own pricing and
retains related inventory risk, is the primary obligor in sales transactions
with its customers, and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its
customers. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue for the sale of products
obtained from other companies at the gross amount billed.


67
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 1Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)


Revenue on
arrangements that include multiple elements such as hardware, software, and
services is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each
element. Each elements allocated revenue is recognized when revenue
recognition criteria for that element has been met. Fair value is generally
determined by vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE), which is based on the
price charged when each element is sold separately. 
If the Company cannot objectively determine
the fair value of any undelivered element included in a multiple-element
arrangement, the Company defers revenue until all elements are delivered and
services have been performed, or until fair value can objectively be determined
for any remaining undelivered elements. When the fair value of a delivered
element has not been established, the Company uses the residual method to
recognize revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements is
determinable. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered
elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is
allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue.


The Company records reductions to revenue for
estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive
programs, including reseller and end user rebates, and other sales programs and
volume-based incentives. The estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a
reduction to revenue in the period the Company has sold the product and
committed to a plan. The Company also records reductions to revenue for
expected future product returns based on the Companys historical experience.


Generally, the Company
does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in
connection with software sales or the sale of extended warranty and support
contracts. When the Company does offer specified upgrade rights, the Company
defers revenue for the fair value of the specified upgrade right until the
future obligation is fulfilled or when the right to the specified upgrade
expires. Additionally, a limited number of the Companys software products are
available with maintenance agreements that grant customers rights to
unspecified future upgrades over the maintenance term on a when and if
available basis. Revenue associated with such maintenance is recognized ratably
over the maintenance term.


Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts


The Company records its allowance
for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. The Company
considers historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances,
credit quality of the Companys customers, current economic conditions and
other factors that may affect customers ability to pay.


Shipping Costs


The Companys shipping and
handling costs are included in cost of sales for all periods presented.


Warranty Expense


The Company provides
currently for the estimated cost for product warranties at the time the related
revenue is recognized. The Company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting
warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual
experience and changes in future estimates.


Software Development Costs


Research and development costs are expensed as
incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or
otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a products
technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available
for general release to customers 


68
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 1Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)


pursuant to SFAS No. 86, 
Computer
Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed
. In most
instances, the Companys products are released soon after technological
feasibility has been established. Therefore, costs incurred subsequent to
achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and
generally all software development costs have been expensed.


In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company began
incurring substantial development costs associated with Mac OS X version 10.4
Tiger subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility as evidenced by
public demonstration in August 2004 and the subsequent release of a
developer beta version of the product. The Company capitalized approximately
$29.7 and $4.5 million during 2005 and 2004, respectively, of costs associated
with the development of Tiger. In accordance with SFAS No. 86, amortization
of this asset to cost of sales began in April 2005 when the Company began
shipping Tiger and is being recognized on a straight-line basis over a 3 year
estimated useful life.


During the second quarter of 2004, the Company
incurred substantial development costs associated with FileMaker Pro 7
subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility as evidenced by public
demonstration and release of a developer beta version, and prior to the release
of the final version of the product in March 2004. Therefore, during the
second quarter of 2004, the Company capitalized approximately $2.3 million of
costs associated with the development of FileMaker Pro 7. In accordance with
SFAS No. 86, amortization of this asset to cost of sales began in March 2004
when the Company began shipping FileMaker Pro 7 and is being recognized on a
straight-line basis over a 3 year estimated useful life.


During the third and fourth quarters of 2003, the
Company incurred substantial development costs associated with the development
of Mac OS X version 10.3 (code-named Panther), subsequent to achievement of
technological feasibility as evidenced by public demonstration and release of a
developer beta in June 2003, and prior to release of the final version of
the product in the first quarter of 2004. Therefore, during 2003 the Company
capitalized approximately $14.7 million of development costs associated with
the development of Panther. Amortization of this asset began in the first
quarter of 2004 when Panther was shipped and is being recognized on a
straight-line basis in accordance with SFAS No. 86 over a 3 year estimated
useful life.


Total amortization related
to capitalized software development costs was $15.7 million, $10.7 million, and
$5.8 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.


Advertising Costs


Advertising costs are
expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $287 million, $206 million, and
$193 million for 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.


Stock-Based Compensation


The Company currently measures compensation expense
for its employee stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value
method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, 
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
. The Company
applies the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123, 
Accounting
for Stock-based Compensation
, as amended by SFAS No. 148, 
Accounting for Stock-based CompensationTransition and Disclosure

as if the fair-value-based method had been applied in measuring compensation
expense. Under APB Opinion No. 25, when the exercise price of the Companys
employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the
date of the grant, no compensation expense is recognized.


69
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 1Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)


As required under
SFAS No. 123, the pro forma effects of stock-based compensation on net
income and earnings per common share for employee stock options granted and
employee stock purchase plan share purchases have been estimated at the date of
grant and beginning of the period, respectively, using a Black-Scholes
option pricing model. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair
value of the options and shares is amortized to pro forma net income over the
options vesting period and the shares plan period.

In December 2004, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), 
Share-Based Payment
, which addresses the accounting for
share-based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee
services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities
that are based on the fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that
may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. SFAS No. 123R
eliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation transactions
using the intrinsic value method under APB Opinion No. 25, and requires
instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based
method. In January 2005, the SEC issued SAB No. 107, which
provides supplemental implementation guidance for SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R
will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of its fiscal
2006. The Companys assessment of the estimated stock-based compensation
expense is affected by the Companys stock price as well as assumptions
regarding a number of complex variables and the related tax impact. These
variables include, but are not limited to, the Companys stock price,
volatility, and employee stock option exercise behaviors and the related tax
impact. The Company will recognize stock-based compensation expense on all
awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period using the
modified prospective method. Although the adoption of SFAS No. 123R is
expected to have a material effect on the Companys results of operations,
future changes to various assumptions used to determine the fair-value of
awards issued or the amount and type of equity awards granted create
uncertainty as to whether future stock-based compensation expense will be
similar to the historical SFAS No. 123 pro forma expense.

Earnings Per Common
Share


Basic earnings per common share is computed by
dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number
of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per
common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by
the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during
the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock
that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of common
stock had been issued. The dilutive effect of outstanding options, restricted stock
and restricted stock units is reflected in diluted earnings per share by
application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an
increase in the fair market value of the Companys common stock can result in a
greater dilutive effect from outstanding options, restricted stock and
restricted stock units. Additionally, the exercise of employee stock options
and the vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units can result in a
greater dilutive effect on earnings per share.

Potentially dilutive
securities representing approximately 12.4 million, 8.7 million, and 101.6 million
shares of common stock for the years ended September 24, 2005,
September 25, 2004, and September 27, 2003, respectively, were
excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for these periods
because their effect would have been antidilutive. These potentially dilutive
securities include stock options, restricted stock, and restricted stock units.


Comprehensive
Income


Comprehensive income
consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other
comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under
generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of
shareholders equity but are excluded from net income. The Companys other
comprehensive income is comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments
from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency,
unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as
available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative
instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges.

The Companys U.S. corporate securities consist
primarily of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, time deposits and
corporate debt securities. Foreign securities consist primarily of foreign
commercial paper, certificates of deposit and time deposits with foreign
institutions, most of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company had
net unrealized losses totaling $5.9 million on its investment portfolio,
approximately half of which related to investments with stated maturities less
than 1 year as of September 24, 2005 and net unrealized losses of $6.3
million on its investment portfolio, primarily related to investments with
stated maturities less than 1 year as of September 25, 2004. The Company
occasionally sells short-term investments prior to their stated maturities. The
Company recognized a net loss before taxes of $137,000 in 2005 and net gains
before taxes of $1 million and $21 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, as a
result of such sales. These net gains were included in interest and other
income, net.


As of September 24, 2005, approximately $287 million
of the Companys short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from
1 to 5 years. The remaining short-term investments as of September 24,
2005 had maturities of 3 to 12 months. As of September 25, 2004,
approximately $180 million of the Companys short-term investments had
underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remaining short-term
investments as of September 25, 2004 had maturities of 3 to 12 months.

Market values were
determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. The
decline in value of these investments is primarily related to changes in
interest rates and is considered to be temporary in nature. Investments are
reviewed periodically to identify possible impairment. When evaluating the
investments, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent
to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the
issuer, and the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment for a
period of time which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market
value.


Accounts Receivable


Trade Receivables


The Company distributes its products through third-party
resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and commercial
customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its
customers. However, when possible the Company does attempt to limit credit risk
on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin
America, Europe, and Asia and by arranging with third-party financing companies
to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the
Companys direct customers. These credit financing arrangements are directly
between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the
Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related
to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables that


73
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 2Financial
Instruments (Continued)


are not covered by collateral, third-party flooring
arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Companys
distribution and retail channel partners. No customer accounted for more than
10% of trade receivables as of September 24, 2005 or September 25,
2004.

Vendor Non-Trade Receivables


The Company has non-trade
receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale
of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture
sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company
purchases these raw material components directly from suppliers. These
non-trade receivables, which are included in the consolidated balance sheets in
other current assets, totaled $417 million and $276 million as of September 24,
2005 and September 25, 2004, respectively. The Company does not reflect
the sale of these components in net sales and does not recognize any profits on
these sales until the products are sold through to the end customer at which
time the profit is recognized as a reduction of cost of sales.


Derivative Financial Instruments


The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its
business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. Foreign currency
forward and option contracts are used to offset the foreign exchange risk on
certain existing assets and liabilities and to hedge the foreign exchange risk
on expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales.
From time to time, the Company enters into interest rate derivative agreements
to modify the interest rate profile of certain investments and debt. The
Companys accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether the
instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. The Company
records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.

The notional principal amounts for derivative
instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of
year-end, and do not represent the amount of the Companys exposure to credit
or market loss. The credit risk amount shown in the table above represents the
Companys gross exposure to potential accounting loss on these transactions if
all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract,
based on then-current currency exchange rates at each respective date.
The Companys exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a
function of currency exchange rates.


The estimates of fair
value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models and prevailing
financial market information as of September 24, 2005 and September 25,
2004. Although the table above reflects the notional principal, fair value, and
credit risk amounts of the Companys foreign exchange instruments, it does not
reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that
the foreign exchange instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately
realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the
gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market
conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.


Foreign Exchange
Risk Management


The Company may enter into foreign currency forward
and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign
exchange risk associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly
committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in
foreign subsidiaries. Generally, the Companys practice is to hedge a majority
of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the
Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to
immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, or
limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments.


To help protect gross margins from fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates, the Companys U.S. dollar functional
subsidiaries hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenues, and the
Companys non-U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries selling in local currencies
hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the
subsidiaries functional currency. Other comprehensive income associated with
hedges of foreign currency revenues is recognized as a component of net sales
in the same


75
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 2Financial
Instruments (Continued)


period as the related sales are recognized, and other
comprehensive income related to inventory purchases is recognized as a
component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are
recognized. Typically, the Company hedges portions of its forecasted foreign
currency exposure associated with revenues and inventory purchases over a time
horizon of 3 to 6 months.


Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges
must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable that the forecasted hedged
transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a
subsequent 2 month time period. Deferred gains and losses in other
comprehensive income associated with such derivative instruments are immediately
reclassified into earnings in other income and expense. Any subsequent changes
in fair value of such derivative instruments are also reflected in current
earnings unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. The
Company recognized net losses of $1.6 million and $2.8 million in 2005 and
2004, respectively, in other income and expense related to the loss of hedge
designation on discontinued cash flow hedges due to changes in the Companys
forecast of future net sales and cost of sales and due to prevailing market
conditions. No net gains, or losses, of a similar nature were recorded in 2003.
As of September 24, 2005, the Company had a net deferred gain associated
with cash flow hedges of approximately $3.6 million, net of taxes, substantially
all of which is expected to be reclassified to earnings by the end of the
second quarter of fiscal 2006.


The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a
derivative instrument designated as a net investment hedge is included in the
cumulative translation adjustment account of accumulated other comprehensive
income within shareholders equity. As of September 24, 2005 and
September 25, 2004, the Company had a net gain of $673,000 and a net loss
of $1.8 million, respectively, included in the cumulative translation
adjustment.


The Company may also enter
into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign
exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and
liabilities recorded in non-functional currencies. Changes in the fair value of
these derivatives are recognized in current earnings in other income and
expense as offsets to the changes in the fair value of the related assets or
liabilities. Due to currency market movements, changes in option time value can
lead to increased volatility in other income and expense.


Interest Rate Risk
Management


From time to time, the Company historically entered
into interest rate derivative transactions with financial institutions in order
to better match the Companys floating-rate interest income on its cash
equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on
any outstanding long-term debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the Companys
exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates.


During 2001 and 2002, the Company entered into and
then subsequently terminated various interest rate debt swap agreements
generating a realized gain of $23 million. These gains were deferred and
amortized over the remaining life of the underlying debt, which matured and was
repaid in February 2004.


As of September 24,
2005 and September 25, 2004, the Company had no interest rate derivatives
outstanding.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company
recorded an adjustment of approximately $11 million to goodwill relating to a
reduction of valuation allowances that were recorded at the time certain net
operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) were acquired in previous business
combinations. During the fourth quarter of 2005, these NOLs were deemed to be
more likely than not to be realized and accordingly the valuation allowances
were reversed against the related goodwill that was recognized at the time of
the acquisitions.


During the third quarter of 2004, the Company recorded
an adjustment of approximately $5 million to goodwill related to the
acquisition of PowerSchool, Inc. (PowerSchool) in 2001. This reduction of
goodwill included the cancellation of 158,334 shares of the Companys common stock,
valued at approximately $2 million, that were previously held in escrow
and were refunded upon resolution of certain matters arising out of the
acquisition of PowerSchool. This adjustment also included approximately $3
million to adjust the original estimates of the pre-acquisition PowerSchool
restructuring liability to actual costs incurred.

The Company recorded total restructuring charges of
approximately $23 million during the year ended September 25, 2004,
including approximately $14 million in severance costs, $5.5 million in asset
impairments, and a $3.5 million charge for lease cancellations in conjunction
with the vacating of a leased sales facility related to a European workforce
reduction during the fourth quarter of 2004. Of the $23 million charge,
$19.7 million had been utilized by the end of 2005, with the remaining $3.3
million consisting of $0.7 million for employee severance benefits and $2.6
million for lease cancellations. These actions will result in the termination
of 461 employees, 448 of which had been terminated prior to the end of 2005.

Restructuring Actions


The Company recorded total restructuring charges of

including approximately $7.4 million in severance costs, a $5.0 million charge
to write-off deferred compensation, $7.1 million in asset impairments,
and a $7.3 million charge for lease cancellations primarily related to the
closure of the Companys Singapore manufacturing operations during the first
quarter of 2003. Of the $26.8 million charge, all had been utilized by the end
of 2005, except for approximately $1.7 million related to operating lease costs
on abandoned facilities. During the third quarter of 2003, approximately
$500,000 of the amount originally accrued for lease cancellations was
determined to be in excess due to the sublease of a property sooner than originally
expected and 
a shortfall

The foreign provision for income taxes is based on
foreign pretax earnings of approximately $922 million, $384 million, and $250
million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. As of September 24, 2005,
approximately $4.3 billion of the Companys cash, cash equivalents, and short-term
investments were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S.
dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are
generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. The
Companys consolidated financial statements fully provide for any related tax
liability on amounts that may be repatriated, aside from undistributed earnings
of certain of the Companys foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be
indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the U.S. U.S. income taxes have
not been provided on a cumulative total of $1.2 billion of such earnings. It is
not practicable to determine the income tax liability that might be incurred if
these earnings were to be distributed.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 6Income
Taxes
 (Continued)


On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation
Act (AJCA) was signed into law. The AJCA includes a provision for the deduction
of 85% of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated, as defined in the
AJCA. The legislation provided the Company with the option to apply this
provision to repatriations of qualifying earnings in either 2005 or 2006. The
Company is continuing to evaluate the effects of the repatriation provision and
expects to complete the evaluation in 2006. A maximum of $755 million may be
eligible for repatriation under the reduced tax rate provided by AJCA. However,
given the uncertainties and complexities of the repatriation provision and the
Companys continuing evaluation, the Company has not yet determined the amount
that may be repatriated or the related potential income tax effects of such
repatriation.


Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the
effects of tax losses, credits, and the future income tax effects of temporary
differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured
using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.


As of September 24,
2005 and September 25, 2004, the significant components of the Companys
deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in millions):

As of September 24, 2005, the Company had
operating loss carryforwards for federal tax purposes of approximately
$62 million, which expire from 2011 through 2024. A portion of these
carryforwards was acquired from the Companys previous acquisitions, the
utilization of which is subject to certain limitations imposed by the Internal
Revenue Code. The Company also has Federal credit carryforwards and various
state and foreign tax loss and credit carryforwards, the tax effect of which is
approximately $206 million and which expire between 2010 and 2025. The
remaining benefits from tax losses and credits do not expire. As of September 24,
2005 and September 25, 2004, a valuation allowance of $5 million and $30
million, respectively, was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the
benefits of tax losses that may not be realized. The remaining valuation
allowance relates principally to the state operating losses. Management
believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income
that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together
with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to
fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets.

During 2005, the Company reversed certain tax
contingency reserves and recorded a corresponding benefit to income tax expense
primarily as a result of a change in the estimated outcome of certain tax
disputes. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company recorded
a benefit to tax expense to adjust its net deferred tax assets as a result of
the Companys year-end review of its deferred tax accounts, the impact of which
was not material to the current or prior periods results of operations. The
total benefit to income tax expense from the reversal of these tax contingency
reserves and adjustments to net deferred tax assets was $67 million. The
Company also recorded a $14 million credit to income tax expense resulting from
a reduction of the valuation allowance.


The Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) has completed its field audit of the Companys federal income tax
returns for all years prior to 2002 and proposed certain adjustments. Certain
of these adjustments are being contested through the IRS Appeals Office. Substantially
all IRS audit issues for these years have been resolved. In addition, the
Company is also subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities.
Management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments
that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits
cannot be predicted with certainty. Should any issues addressed in the Companys
tax audits be resolved in a manner not consistent with managements
expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income
tax in the period such resolution occurs.


Note 7Shareholders Equity


Preferred Stock


The Company has 5 million shares of authorized
preferred stock, none of which is outstanding. Under the terms of the Companys
Restated Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors is authorized to
determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the
Companys authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 7Shareholders
Equity (Continued)


Restricted Stock Units


During 2005 and 2004, the
Companys Board of Directors approved the grant of 230,000 and 5.03 million
restricted stock units, respectively, to members of the Companys senior
management team, excluding its CEO. These restricted stock units generally vest
over four years either in two equal installments on the second and fourth
anniversaries of the date of grant or in equal installments on each of the
first through fourth anniversaries of the grant date. Upon vesting, the
restricted stock units will convert into an equivalent number of shares of
common stock. The Company has recorded $10.3 million and $64.4 million in 2005
and 2004, respectively, in value for these restricted stock units as a component
of shareholders equity and is amortizing the amounts on a straight-line basis
over the four-year requisite service period. The value of the restricted stock
units was based on the closing market price of the Companys common stock on
the date of grant. The restricted stock units have been included in the
calculation of diluted earnings per share utilizing the treasury stock method.


CEO Restricted Stock Award


On March 19, 2003, the Company entered into an
Option Cancellation and Restricted Stock Award Agreement (the Agreement) with Mr. Steven
P. Jobs, its CEO. The Agreement cancelled stock option awards for the purchase
of 55 million shares of the Companys common stock previously granted to Mr. Jobs
in 2000 and 2001. Mr. Jobs retained options to purchase 120,000 shares of
the Companys common stock granted in August of 1997 in his capacity as a
member of the Companys Board of Directors, prior to becoming the Companys CEO.
The Agreement replaced the cancelled options with a restricted stock award of 10
million shares of the Companys common stock. The restricted stock award
generally vests three years from the date of grant. Vesting of some or all of
the restricted shares will be accelerated in the event Mr. Jobs is
terminated without cause, dies, or has his management role reduced following a
change in control of the Company.


The Company determined the
value of the restricted stock award in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25
and has recorded the value as deferred stock compensation as a component of shareholders
equity and is amortizing that amount on a straight-line basis over the 3 year
service period. The value of the restricted stock award was based on the
closing market price of the Companys common stock on the date of the award.
The 10 million restricted shares have been included in the calculation of
diluted earnings per share utilizing the treasury stock method.


Stock Repurchase Plan


In July 1999, the Companys Board of Directors
authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its
common stock. This repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any
specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time.


During the fourth quarter
of 2001, the Company entered into a forward purchase agreement to acquire
3.1 million shares of its common stock in September of 2003 at an
average price of $8.32 per share for a total cost of $25.5 million. In August 2003,
the Company settled this agreement prior to its maturity, at which time the
Companys common stock had a fair value of $11.41. Other than this forward
purchase transaction, the Company has not engaged in any transactions to
repurchase its common stock since 2000. Since inception of the stock repurchase
plan, the Company had repurchased a total of 13.1 million shares at a cost of
$217 million. The Company was authorized to repurchase up to an additional $283
million of its common stock as of September 24, 2005.

Comprehensive Income


Comprehensive income consists of two components, net
income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to
revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders equity but
are excluded from net income. The Companys other comprehensive income consists
of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using
the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on
marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains
and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges.

Note 8Employee Benefit Plans


2003 Employee Stock Plan


The 2003 Employee Stock
Plan (the 2003 Plan) is a shareholder approved plan that provides for broad-based
grants to employees, including executive officers. Based on the terms of
individual option grants, options granted under the 2003 Plan generally expire
7 to 10 years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a
period of 4 years, based on continued employment, with either annual or
quarterly vesting. The 2003 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock
options, nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock units, stock appreciation
rights, and stock purchase rights.


1997 Employee Stock Option Plan


In August 1997, the
Companys Board of Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the
1997 Plan), a non-shareholder approved plan for grants of stock options to
employees who are not officers of the Company. Based on the terms of individual
option grants, options granted under the 1997 Plan generally expire 7 to 10
years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of
4 years, based on continued employment, with either annual or quarterly
vesting. In October 2003, the Company terminated the 1997 Employee Stock
Option Plan and cancelled all remaining unissued shares totaling 28,590,702.  No new options can be granted from the 1997
Plan.


Employee Stock Option Exchange Program


On March 20, 2003,
the Company announced a voluntary employee stock option exchange program (the
Exchange Program) whereby eligible employees, other than executive officers and
members of the Board of Directors, had an opportunity to exchange outstanding
options with exercise prices at or above $12.50 per share for a
predetermined smaller number of new stock options issued with exercise prices
equal to the fair market value of one share of the Companys common stock on
the day the new awards were issued, which was to be at least six months plus
one day after the exchange options were cancelled. On April 17, 2003, in accordance
with the Exchange Program, the Company cancelled options to purchase 33,138,386
shares of its common stock. On October 22, 2003, new stock options
totaling 13,394,736 shares were issued to employees at an exercise price of
$11.38 per share, which is equivalent to the closing price of the Companys
stock on that date. No financial or accounting impact to the Companys
financial position, results of operations or cash flow was associated with this
transaction.


1997 Director Stock Option Plan


In August 1997, the
Companys Board of Directors adopted a shareholder approved Director Stock
Option Plan (DSOP) for non-employee directors of the Company. Initial grants of
30,000 options under the DSOP vest in three equal installments on each of the
first through third anniversaries of the date of grant, and subsequent annual
grants of 10,000 options are fully vested at grant.


Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans


Certain of the Companys
executive officers, including Mr. Timothy D. Cook, Mr. Peter
Oppenheimer, Mr. Jonathan Rubinstein, Mr. Philip W. Schiller, Dr. Bertrand
Serlet, and Dr. Avadis Tevanian, Jr., have entered into trading plans
pursuant to Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended. A trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the
amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and
dates) of future purchases or sales of the Companys stock including the
exercise and sale of employee stock options and shares acquired pursuant to the
Companys employee stock purchase plan and upon vesting of restricted stock
units.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan


The Company has a
shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan (the Purchase Plan), under
which substantially all employees may purchase common stock through payroll
deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values as of
the beginning and end of six month offering periods. Stock purchases under the
Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of an employees compensation, up to a maximum
of $25,000 in any calendar year. Beginning with the six-month offering period
that started on June 30, 2003, the number of shares authorized for
issuance is limited to a total of 1 million shares per offering period. During
2005, 2004, and 2003, adjusted for the February 2005 stock split 2.3
million, 3.9 million, and 4.3 million shares, respectively, were issued under
the Purchase Plan. As of September 24, 2005, approximately 3.8 million
shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan.


Employee Savings Plan


The Company has an
employee savings plan (the Savings Plan) qualifying as a deferred salary
arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under
the Savings Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their
pre-tax earnings, up to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limit
($14,000 for calendar year 2005). The Company matches 50% to 100% of each
employees contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of
the employees earnings. The Companys matching contributions to the Savings
Plan were approximately $28 million, $24 million, and $21 million in 2005,
2004, and 2003, respectively.

Company had exercisable options outstanding to purchase 77.5 million shares
with a weighted average exercise price of $9.38 per share.


The Company had 5.03
million restricted stock units outstanding as of September 24, 2005, which
were excluded from the options outstanding balances in the preceding tables.
None of these restricted stock units was vested as of September 24, 2005.
These restricted stock units have been deducted from the shares available for grant
under the Companys stock option plans.


Note 9Stock-Based
Compensation


The Company has provided pro forma disclosures in Note
1 of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the effect on net
income and earnings per share as if the fair value method of accounting for
stock compensation had been used for its employee stock option grants and
employee stock purchase plan purchases. These pro forma effects have been
estimated at the date of grant and beginning of the period, respectively, using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model.


For purposes of the pro forma disclosures provided
pursuant to SFAS No. 123, the option awards issued in October 2003
and the awards cancelled as part of the Employee Stock Option Exchange Program
have been accounted for using modification accounting. In accordance with SFAS
No. 123, the grant date of the awards issued is the date of acceptance of
the exchange offer by participating employees. The cancellation of certain of
the Companys CEOs options and replacement with restricted shares in
March 2003 is also being accounted for using modification accounting for
purposes of the pro forma disclosures provided pursuant to SFAS No. 123.

For purposes of the pro
forma disclosures provided pursuant to SFAS No. 123, the expected
volatility assumptions used by the Company are based on the historical
volatility of the Companys common stock over the most recent period
commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Companys stock options
and other relevant factors including implied volatility in market traded
options on the Companys common stock and the impact of unusual fluctuations
not reasonably expected to recur on the historical volatility of the Companys
common stock. The Company bases its expected life assumption on its historical
experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock options it grants to
employees.


Note 10Commitments and Contingencies


Lease Commitments


The Company leases various equipment and facilities,
including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The
Company does not currently utilize any other off-balance-sheet financing
arrangements. The major facility leases are for terms of 5 to 15 years and
generally provide renewal options for terms of 3 to 5 additional years. Leases
for retail space are for terms of 5 to 20 years, the majority of which are for
10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of September 24,
2005, the Companys total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable
operating leases were $865 million, of which $606 million related to leases for
retail space.

Accrued
Warranty and Indemnifications


The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor
warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period for hardware products
is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. The Company
also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair
the Companys hardware products. The Company provides currently for the
estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product warranties
at the time related revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining
appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the
installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical and
projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and
knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Companys
typical experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting
warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual
experience and changes in future estimates.

The Company generally does
not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software
against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual
property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include
indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs
and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an
indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any
significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against
itself or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does
not have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims
subject to indemnification that would have a material adverse effect on its
financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Therefore, the Company
did not record a liability for infringement costs as of either September 24,
2005 or September 25, 2004.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 10Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)


Concentrations in
the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product


Although most components
essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple
sources, other key components (including microprocessors and application-specific
integrated circuits (ASICs)) are currently obtained by the Company from
single or limited sources. Some other key components, while currently available
to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide
availability and pricing pressures. In addition, the Company uses some
components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry,
and new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom
components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated
whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers. If
the supply of a key single-sourced component to the Company were to be
delayed or curtailed, or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays
shipments of completed products to the Company, the Companys ability to ship
related products in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be
adversely affected. The Companys business and financial performance could also
be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient
quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient
quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these
components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the
production of common components instead of components customized to meet the
Companys requirements. Finally, significant portions of the Companys CPUs,
logic boards, and assembled products are now manufactured by outsourcing
partners, primarily in various parts of Asia. Although the Company works
closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Companys
operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were
unable to meet their production obligations.


Long-Term Supply Agreements


Subsequent to September 24,
2005, the Company entered into long-term supply agreements with Hynix
Semiconductor, Inc., Intel Corporation, Micron Technology, Inc.,
Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and Toshiba Corporation to secure supply of NAND
flash memory through calendar year 2010. As part of these agreements, the
Company intends to prepay a total of $1.25 billion for flash memory components
by the end of the second quarter of 2006.


Contingencies


The Company is subject to
certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary
course of business and have not been fully adjudicated. In the opinion of
management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any
current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the
aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity,
or results of operations. However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be
predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these
legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the
Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular
reporting period could be materially adversely affected.


Production and marketing
of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to
environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the
requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of
its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or
recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been passed
in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates including various
European Union member countries, Japan and certain states within the U.S. Although
the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future
based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no
assurance that 


91
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 10Commitments
and Contingencies (Continued)


such existing laws or
future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial
condition, liquidity, or results of operations.


Note 11Segment Information and Geographic Data


In accordance with SFAS No. 131, 
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information
,
the Company reports segment information based on the management approach. The
management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for
making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Companys
reportable segments.


The Company manages its business primarily on a
geographic basis. The Companys reportable operating segments are comprised of
the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas, Europe, and Japan
reportable segments do not include activities related to the Retail segment. The
Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment
includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Retail
segment operates Apple-owned retail stores in the U.S., Canada, Japan, and the
U.K. Other operating segments include Asia-Pacific, which includes Australia
and Asia except for Japan, and the Companys subsidiary, FileMaker, Inc. Each
reportable geographic operating segment provides similar hardware and software
products and similar services, and the accounting policies of the various
segments are the same as those described in Note 1, Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies, except as described below for the Retail segment.


The Company evaluates the performance of its operating
segments based on net sales. The Retail segments performance is also evaluated
based on operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally
based on the location of the customers. Operating income for each segment
includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating
expenses directly attributable to the segment. Operating income for each
segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses that are managed
outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income
include various corporate expenses, manufacturing costs and variances not
included in standard costs, income taxes, and various nonrecurring charges.
Corporate expenses include research and development, corporate marketing
expenses, manufacturing costs and variances not included in standard costs, and
other separately managed general and administrative expenses including certain
corporate expenses associated with support of the Retail segment. The Company
does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management
reporting purposes. Segment assets exclude corporate assets. Corporate assets
include cash, short-term and long-term investments, manufacturing facilities, miscellaneous
corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets, and
retail store construction-in-progress that is not subject to depreciation.
Except for the Retail segment, capital expenditures for long-lived assets are
not reported to management by segment. Capital expenditures by the Retail
segment were $132 million, $104 million, and $92 million for 2005, 2004, and
2003 respectively.


Operating income for all segments, except Retail,
includes cost of sales at manufacturing standard cost, other cost of sales,
related sales and marketing costs, and certain general and administrative
costs. This measure of operating income, which includes manufacturing profit,
provides a comparable basis for comparison between the Companys various geographic
segments. Certain manufacturing expenses and related adjustments not included
in segment cost of sales, including variances between standard and actual
manufacturing costs and the mark-up above standard cost for product supplied to
the Retail segment, are included in corporate expenses.


92
 






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Note 11Segment
Information and Geographic Data
 (Continued)


Management assesses the operating performance of the
Retail segment differently than it assesses the operating performance of the
Companys geographic segments. The Retail segment revenue and operating income
is intended to depict a measure comparable to that of the Companys major
channel partners in the U.S. operating retail stores so the Company can
evaluate the Retail segment performance as if it were a channel partner.
Therefore, the Company makes three significant adjustments to the Retail
segment for management reporting purposes that are not included in the results
of the Companys other segments.


First, the Retail segments operating income includes
cost of sales for Apple products at an amount normally charged to major channel
partners in the U.S. operating retail stores, less the cost of sales programs
and incentives provided to those channel partners and the Companys cost to
support those partners. For the years ended September 24, 2005, September 25,
2004, and September 27, 2003, this resulted in the recognition of
additional cost of sales above standard cost by the Retail segment and an
offsetting benefit to corporate expenses of approximately $435 million, $213
million, and $106 million, respectively.


Second, the Companys service and support contracts
are transferred to the Retail segment at the same cost as that charged to the
Companys major retail channel partners in the U.S., resulting in a measure of
revenue and gross margin for those items that is comparable between the Companys
Retail stores and those retail channel partners. The Retail segment recognizes
the full amount of revenue and cost of sales of the Companys service and
support contracts at the time of sale. Because the Company has not yet earned
the revenue or incurred the costs associated with the sale of these contracts,
an offset to these amounts is recognized in other operating segments net sales
and cost of sales. For the year ended September 24, 2005, this resulted in
the recognition of net sales and cost of sales by the Retail segment, with
corresponding offsets in other operating segments, of $92 million and $64
million, respectively. For the year ended September 25, 2004, the net
sales and cost of sales recognized by the Retail segment for sales of service
and support contracts were $54 million and $37 million, respectively. For the
year ended September 27, 2003, this resulted in the recognition of net
sales and cost of sales by the Retail segment of $30 million and $20 million,
respectively.


Third, the Company has opened seven high profile
stores in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Tokyo, Japan, Osaka,
Japan, and London, England as of September 24, 2005. These high profile
stores are larger than the Companys typical retail stores and were designed to
further promote brand awareness and provide a venue for certain corporate sales
and marketing activities, including corporate briefings. As such, the Company
allocates certain operating expenses associated with these stores to corporate
marketing expense to reflect the estimated benefit realized Company-wide. The
allocation of these operating costs is based on the amount incurred for a high
profile store in excess of that incurred by a more typical Company retail
location. Expenses allocated to corporate marketing resulting from the
operations of these stores were $31 million, $16 million, and $6 million for
the years ended September 24, 2005, September 25, 2004, and September 27,
2003, respectively.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


The
Board of Directors and Shareholders


Apple Computer, Inc.:


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Apple Computer, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 24,
2005 and September 25, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended September 24, 2005. These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.


We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.


In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of September 24, 2005 and September 25,
2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended September 24, 2005, in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.


We also have audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 24,
2005, based on criteria established in 
Internal
Control-Integrated Framework 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated November 29,
2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment of, and the
effective operation of internal control over financial reporting.


As discussed in Note 1 to
the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of
accounting for asset retirement obligations and for financial instruments with
characteristics of both liabilities and equity in 2003.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


The Board of Directors and Shareholders


Apple Computer, Inc.:


We have audited managements assessment, included in
the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting, that Apple Computer, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2005, based
on criteria established in 
Internal
Control-Integrated Framework 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Apple Computer, Inc.s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of Apple
Computer, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.


We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.


A companys internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.


Because of inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


In our opinion, managements assessment that Apple
Computer, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of September 24, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects,
based on criteria established in 
Internal
Control-Integrated Framework 
issued by COSO. Also, in our opinion, Apple
Computer, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of September 24, 2005, based on criteria
established in 
Internal Control-Integrated Framework 
issued
by COSO.


We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Apple Computer, Inc. as of September 24,
2005 and September 25, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended September 24, 2005, and our report dated November 29,
2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 
Apple Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively Apple or the Company) design, manufacture, and market personal computers, mobile communication devices, and portable
digital music and video players and sell a variety of related software, third-party digital content and applications, services, peripherals, and networking solutions. The Company sells its products worldwide through its online stores, its retail
stores, its direct sales force, and third-party wholesalers, resellers and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Macintosh (Mac), iPhone and iPod compatible products including application
software, printers, storage devices, speakers, headphones, and various other accessories and supplies through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to consumer, small and mid-sized business (SMB), education, enterprise,
government and creative customers. 
 
Basis of Presentation and Preparation 
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these
consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements
and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 
 
Certain prior year amounts in the
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current years presentation. During the first quarter of 2009, the Company reclassified $2.4 billion of certain fixed-income securities from
short-term marketable securities to long-term marketable securities in the September 27, 2008 Consolidated Balance Sheet. The reclassification resulted from a change in accounting presentation for certain investments based on contractual
maturity dates, which more closely reflects the Companys assessment of the timing of when such securities will be converted to cash. As a result of this change, marketable securities with maturities less than 12 months are classified as
short-term and marketable securities with maturities greater than 12 months are classified as long-term. There have been no changes in the Companys investment policies or practices associated with this change in accounting presentation. See
Note 2, Financial Instruments of this Form 10-K for additional information. 
 
The Companys fiscal year is the
52 or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Companys fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007 ended on September 26, 2009, September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007, respectively, and included 52 weeks
each. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter approximately every six years to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years or quarters refer to the Companys fiscal
years ended in September and the associated quarters of those fiscal years. 
 
In May 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) established general accounting standards and disclosure for subsequent events. The Company adopted FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 855,
 Subsequent Events 
(formerly referenced as
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 165, 
Subsequent Events
), during the third quarter of 2009. The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the date and time the financial statements were issued on
October 27, 2009. 
 
Financial Instruments 
 
Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities 
 
All highly liquid investments
with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. The Companys debt and marketable equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. Management determines the
appropriate classification of its investments in debt securities at

 
 


59 






Table of Contents



the time of purchase and reevaluates the available-for-sale designations as of each balance sheet date. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term
based on each instruments underlying contractual maturity date. Marketable securities with maturities of less than 12 months are classified as short-term and marketable securities with maturities greater than 12 months are classified as
long-term. These securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of shareholders equity. The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method.

 
Derivative Financial Instruments 
 
During the second quarter of 2009, the Company adopted FASB ASC 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging
 (formerly referenced as SFAS No. 161, 
Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities  an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133
), which requires additional disclosures about the Companys objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments, how the derivative instruments and related hedged items
are accounted for, and how the derivative instruments and related hedged item affect the financial statements. 
 
The Company
accounts for its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value. Derivatives that are not defined as hedges must be adjusted to fair value through earnings. 
 
For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges, the
effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged
transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in current earnings. To receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to
expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments that hedge
the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that are designated as fair value hedges, the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged
risk are recognized in earnings in the current period. The Company did not have a net gain or loss on these derivative instruments during 2009, 2008 and 2007. The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is
designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure of the net investment in a foreign operation is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For forward exchange contracts designated as net
investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this component are recognized in current earnings.

 
Fair Value Measurements 
 
During the first quarter of 2009, the Company adopted FASB ASC 820, 
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures 
(formerly referenced as SFAS No. 157, 
Fair Value Measurements
), which
defines fair value, establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. This new accounting standard does not require any new fair value measurements. The Company applies fair value accounting
for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received
from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair
value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent
risk, transfer restrictions and credit risk. 
 
During the first quarter of 2009, the Company adopted FASB ASC
825, 
Financial Instruments
 (formerly referenced as SFAS No. 159, 
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  Including


 
 


60 






Table of Contents




an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115
)
,
 which allows companies to choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not required
to be measured at fair value. The Company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments. 
 
Inventories 


 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out method, or market. If the cost of the
inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. The Companys inventories consist primarily of finished goods for all periods presented. 
 
Property, Plant and Equipment 
 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the
underlying building, up to five years for equipment, and the shorter of lease terms or ten years for leasehold improvements. The Company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the
preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. Depreciation and amortization expense on
property and equipment was $577 million, $363 million and $249 million during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 
 
Asset Retirement
Obligations 
 
The Company records obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the
associated asset retirement costs. The Company reviews legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. If it is determined that a
legal obligation exists, the fair value of the liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of the liability is added to the
carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. The difference between the gross expected future cash flow and its present value is accreted over the life of the related lease as
an operating expense. All of the Companys existing asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. The Companys asset retirement
liability was $25 million and $21 million as of September 26, 2009 and September 27, 2008, respectively. 
 
Long-Lived Assets
Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets 
 
The Company reviews property, plant and equipment and certain
identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets
is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property, plant and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be
recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. The Company did not record any material impairments during 2009, 2008 and 2007. 
 
The Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, rather such assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. The Company performs its goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests on or about August 31 of each year. The Company did not recognize any goodwill or
intangible asset impairment charges in 2009, 2008 and 2007. The Company established reporting units based on its current reporting structure. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to
the extent it relates to each reporting unit. 
 
 


61 






Table of Contents


The Company amortizes its intangible assets with definite lives over their estimated useful
lives and reviews these assets for impairment. The Company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods ranging from one to ten years. 
 
Foreign Currency Translation and Remeasurement 
 
The Company translates the
assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those
in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are credited or charged to foreign currency translation included in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity. The Companys subsidiaries that use
the U.S. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and inventories, property, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. Gains and losses
from these remeasurements were insignificant and have been included in the Companys results of operations. 
 
Revenue Recognition 


 
Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, peripherals, and
service and support contracts. For any product within these groups that either is software, or is considered software-related (e.g., Mac computers, iPhones and iPod portable digital music and video players), the Company accounts for such products in
accordance with the specific industry accounting guidance for software and software related transactions. The Company applies various revenue-related GAAP for products that are not software or software-related, such as digital content sold on the
iTunes Store and certain Mac, iPhone and iPod supplies and accessories, which is described below. 
 
The Company recognizes
revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of
loss have been transferred. For most of the Companys product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the
Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is not, or
is presumed not to be, fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met. 
 
Revenue from service and support contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the service coverage periods. These contracts typically include extended phone support, repair
services, web-based support resources, diagnostic tools, and extend the service coverage offered under the Companys standard limited warranty. 
 
The Company sells software and peripheral products obtained from other companies. The Company generally establishes its own pricing and retains related inventory risk, is the primary obligor in sales
transactions with its customers, and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. Accordingly, the Company generally recognizes revenue for the sale of products obtained from other companies based on the gross amount billed.

 
The Company accounts for multiple element arrangements that consist only of software or software-related products in
accordance with industry specific accounting guidance for software and software related transactions. If a multiple-element arrangement includes deliverables that are neither software nor software-related, the Company applies various revenue-related
GAAP to determine if those deliverables constitute separate units of accounting from the software or software-related deliverables. If the Company can separate the deliverables, the Company applies the industry specific accounting guidance to the
software and software-related deliverables and applies other appropriate guidance to the non-software related deliverables. Revenue on arrangements that include multiple elements such as hardware, software and services is allocated to each element
based on the

 
 


62 






Table of Contents



relative fair value of each element. Each elements allocated revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met. Fair value is generally determined
by vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE), which is based on the price charged when each element is sold separately. If the Company cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in a multiple-element
arrangement, the Company defers revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been performed, or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements. When the fair value of a delivered element has not
been established, but fair value exists for the undelivered elements, the Company uses the residual method to recognize revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements is determinable. Under the residual method, the fair value of the
undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue. 
 
For both iPhone and Apple TV, the Company has indicated it may from time-to-time provide future unspecified features and additional software products free of charge to customers. Accordingly, iPhone
handsets and Apple TV sales are accounted for under subscription accounting in accordance with GAAP. As such, the revenue and associated cost of sales are deferred at the time of sale, and are both recognized on a straight-line basis over the
currently estimated 24-month economic life of these products, with any loss recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred by the Company for engineering, sales, marketing and warranty are expensed as incurred. 
 
The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs,
including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. The estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue in the period the Company has sold the product and committed to a plan. The
Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Companys historical experience. Revenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the
collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority. 
 
Generally, the Company
does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales or the sale of extended warranty and support contracts. When the Company does offer specified upgrade rights, the Company defers revenue for
the fair value of the specified upgrade right until the future obligation is fulfilled or the right to the specified upgrade expires. A limited number of the Companys software products are available with maintenance agreements that grant
customers rights to unspecified future upgrades over the maintenance term on a when and if available basis. Revenue associated with such maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term. 
 
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
 
The Company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. The Company considers historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of the Companys customers,
current economic conditions, and other factors that may affect customers ability to pay. 
 
Shipping Costs 
 
For all periods presented, amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue, and the Companys
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales. 
 
Warranty Expense 
 
The Company generally provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. The Company assesses the adequacy of its
preexisting warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates. For products accounted for under subscription accounting, the Company recognizes warranty expense as incurred.

Software Development Costs 
 
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when
a products technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. In most instances, the Companys products are released soon after technological feasibility has been
established. Therefore, costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally most software development costs have been expensed. 
 
In 2009 and 2008, the Company capitalized $71 million and $11 million, respectively, of costs associated with the development of Mac OS X Version 10.6 Snow Leopard (Mac OS X
Snow Leopard), which was released during the fourth quarter of 2009. During 2007, the Company capitalized $75 million of costs associated with the development of Mac OS X Version 10.5 Leopard (Mac OS X Leopard) and iPhone software.
The capitalized costs are being amortized to cost of sales on a straight-line basis over a three year estimated useful life of the underlying technology.
 
Total amortization related to capitalized software development costs was $25 million, $27 million and $13 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 
 
Advertising Costs 
 
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $501 million, $486 million and $467 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 
 
Stock-Based Compensation 
 
The Company accounts for stock-based payment
transactions in which the Company receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by
the issuance of such equity instruments. Stock-based compensation cost for restricted stock units (RSUs) is measured based on the closing fair market value of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation
cost for stock options is estimated at the grant date based on each options fair-value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) option-pricing model. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation cost as expense ratably on
a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company will recognize a benefit from stock-based compensation in equity if an incremental tax benefit is realized by following the ordering provisions of the tax law. In addition, the
Company accounts for the indirect effects of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit, the foreign tax credit and the domestic manufacturing deduction through the income statement. Further information regarding stock-based compensation
can be found in Note 7, Shareholders Equity and Stock-Based Compensation. 
 
Income Taxes 
 
The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the
amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. 
 
During 2008, the Company adopted FASB Accounting Standards
Codification (ASC) 740,
 Income Taxes 
(formerly referenced as FASB Financial Interpretation No. 48, 
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an


 
 


64 






Table of Contents




interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109)
, which changed the framework for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax
position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are
then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. See Note 6, Income Taxes for additional information, including the effects of adoption on the Companys
consolidated financial statements. 
 
Earnings Per Common Share 
 
Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of
common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued. Potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options, shares to be purchased under the employee stock purchase plan and unvested RSUs.
The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted earnings per common share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the Companys common
stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities. 
 
The following table sets forth the
computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share for the three years ended September 26, 2009 (in thousands, except net income in millions and per share amounts):

Potentially dilutive securities representing 12.6 million, 10.3 million and
13.7 million shares of common stock for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share for these periods because their effect would have been antidilutive. 
 
Comprehensive Income 
 
Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under GAAP are recorded as an element of shareholders equity but
are excluded from net income. The Companys other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on
marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges. 
 
Segment Information 
 
The Company reports segment information based on the
management approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Companys reportable segments. Information about the
Companys products, major customers and geographic areas on a company-wide basis is also disclosed.

During the first quarter of 2009, the Company changed its accounting presentation for
certain fixed-income investments, which resulted in the reclassification of certain investments from short-term marketable securities to long-term marketable securities. As a result, prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the
current years presentation. The Company classifies its marketable securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instruments underlying contractual maturity date, while its prior classifications were based on the nature of
the securities and their availability for use in current operations. As a result of this change, marketable securities with maturities of less than 12 months are classified as short-term and marketable securities with maturities greater than 12
months are classified as long-term. The Companys long-term marketable securities maturities range from one year to five years. The Company believes this new presentation is preferable as it more closely reflects the Companys
assessment of the timing of when such securities will be converted to cash. Accordingly, certain fixed-income investments totaling $2.4 billion have been reclassified from short-term marketable securities to long-term marketable securities in
the September 27, 2008 Consolidated Balance Sheet to conform to the current years financial statement presentation. There have been no changes in the Companys investment policies or practices associated with this change in
accounting presentation.

Table of Contents


The Company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment
portfolio to be temporary in nature. The unrealized losses on the Companys marketable securities were caused primarily by changes in market interest rates, specifically, widening credit spreads. The Company typically invests in highly-rated
securities, and its policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Companys investment policy requires investments to be investment grade, primarily rated single-A or better, with the objective of minimizing the
potential risk of principal loss. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating the investments for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and
extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the Companys intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell, the investment before
recovery of the investments amortized cost basis. During the years ended September 26, 2009 and September 27, 2008, the Company did not recognize any material impairment charges. As of September 26, 2009, the Company does not
consider any of its investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired. 
 
Derivative Financial Instruments 
 
The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. The Company may enter into foreign
currency forward and option contracts to offset some of the foreign exchange risk of expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales, of net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and on certain existing assets and
liabilities. To help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Companys subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar, hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue. The
Companys subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar and who sell in local currencies, may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries functional currencies. The Company
typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases for three to six months. To help protect the net investment in a foreign operation from adverse changes in foreign currency
exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company may also enter into
foreign currency forward and option contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. However, the Company may
choose not to hedge certain foreign currency exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to immateriality, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no
assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 
The Companys accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. The Company records all derivatives on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets at fair value. The effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in other comprehensive
income as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments and the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges and net investment hedges are adjusted to fair value through earnings in other
income and expense. 
 
The Company had a net deferred gain associated with cash flow hedges of approximately $31 million and $19
million, net of taxes, recorded in other comprehensive income as of September 26, 2009 and September 27, 2008, respectively. Other comprehensive income associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue is recognized as a
component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and other comprehensive income related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases is recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs
are recognized. The portion of the Companys net deferred gain related to products under subscription accounting is expected to be recorded in earnings ratably over the related products estimated economic lives beginning when the hedged
transactions occur, while the portion of the net deferred gain related to other products is expected to be recorded in earnings at the time the hedged transactions occur. As of September 26, 2009, the hedged transactions are expected to occur
within six months.

Table of Contents


Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when
it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two month time period. Deferred gains and losses in other comprehensive income associated with such derivative instruments
are reclassified immediately into earnings through other income and expense. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments also are reflected in current earnings unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions.
The Company did not recognize any material net gains or losses related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges during 2009, 2008 and 2007. 
 
The Company had an unrealized net loss on net investment hedges of $2 million and $1 million, net of taxes, included in the cumulative translation adjustment account of accumulated other comprehensive
income (AOCI) as of September 26, 2009 and September 27, 2008, respectively. The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness test of net investment hedges are recorded in current earnings in other income
and expense. 
 
The Company recognized in earnings a net gain of $133 million on foreign currency forward and option contracts
not designated as hedging instruments during the year ended September 26, 2009. 
 
The following table shows the notional
principal and credit risk amounts of the Companys derivative instruments outstanding as of September 26, 2009 and September 27, 2008 (in millions):

The notional principal amounts for derivative instruments provide one measure of the
transaction volume outstanding as of September 26, 2009, and do not represent the amount of the Companys exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts represent the Companys gross exposure to potential accounting loss
on these transactions if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency exchange rates at each respective date. The Companys gross exposure on these transactions may be further
mitigated by collateral received from certain counterparties. The Companys exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a function of currency exchange rates. Although the table above reflects the notional principal and
credit risk amounts of the Companys foreign exchange instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the foreign exchange instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately
realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. 
 
The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with
the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received when the net fair value of certain financial instruments exceeds contractually
established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values. The Company did not record a material amount of cash collateral related to the derivative instruments under its master
netting arrangements as of September 26, 2009. The Company did not have any derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features that would require it to post additional collateral as of September 26, 2009. 
 
The estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models and prevailing financial market information as of
September 26, 2009. Refer to Note 3, Fair Value Measurements of this Form 10-K,

Accounts Receivable 
 
Trade Receivables 
 
The Company distributes its products through third-party
distributors, cellular network carriers, and resellers and directly to certain education, consumer and enterprise customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral in
certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Australia, or by requiring third-party
financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk
sharing related to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables not covered by collateral, third-party financing arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Companys distribution and retail channel
partners. Trade receivables from one of the Companys customers accounted for 16% of trade receivables as of September 26, 2009 and two of the Companys customers accounted for 15% and 10%, respectively, of trade receivables as of
September 27, 2008.

Vendor Non-Trade Receivables 
 
The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture
sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these raw material components directly from suppliers. These non-trade receivables, which are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in other current assets,
totaled $1.7 billion and $2.3 billion as of September 26, 2009 and September 27, 2008, respectively. Vendor non-trade receivables from two of the Companys vendors accounted for 40% and 36%, respectively, of non-trade receivables as
of September 26, 2009 and two of the Companys vendors accounted for 47% and 38%, respectively, of non-trade receivables as of September 27, 2008. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in net sales and does not
recognize any profits on these sales until the related products are sold by the Company, at which time any profit is recognized as a reduction of cost of sales. 
 
Note 3  Fair Value Measurements 
 
The Company defines fair value as
the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are
required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset
or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and credit risk. 
 
 


71 






Table of Contents


The Company applies the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to
measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement: 
 
Level 1
  Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
 
Level 2 
 Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets,
or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 
 
Level 3 
 Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect managements estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

 
The Companys valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity
securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of all other financial instruments, all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings,
were valued based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.

Table of Contents


The Companys goodwill is allocated primarily to the Americas reportable
operating segment. Amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets was $53 million, $46 million and $35 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. As of September 26, 2009 and September 27, 2008, the remaining
weighted-average amortization period for acquired technology was 7.2 years and 7.0 years, respectively. 
 
Expected annual
amortization expense related to acquired technology as of September 26, 2009, is as follows (in millions):

The foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pretax earnings of $4.4
billion, $3.5 billion and $2.2 billion in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. As of September 26, 2009 and September 27, 2008, $17.4 billion and $11.3 billion, respectively, of the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. The Companys consolidated
financial statements provide for any related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated, aside from undistributed earnings of certain of the Companys foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations
outside the U.S. U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $5.1 billion of such earnings. It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that might be incurred if these earnings were to be distributed.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits, and the
future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income
in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. 
 
As of September 26, 2009 and
September 27, 2008, the significant components of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in millions):

The Companys income taxes payable have been reduced by the tax benefits from
employee stock plan awards. For stock options, the Company receives an income tax benefit calculated as the difference between the fair market value of the stock issued at the time of the exercise and the option price, tax effected. The Company
had net tax benefits from employee stock plan awards of $246 million, $770 million and $398 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, which were reflected as increases to common stock. 
 
On October 3, 2008, the Tax Extenders and Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008 was signed into law. This bill, among other things, retroactively extended the expired
research and development tax credit. As a result, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $42 million in the first quarter of 2009 to account for the retroactive effects of the research credit extension. 
 
Uncertain Tax Positions 
 
As discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies the Company adopted new accounting principles on accounting for uncertain tax positions in 2008. Under these new principles, tax positions are evaluated in a
two-step process. The Company first determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax

Table of Contents



position will be sustained upon examination. If a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold it is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the
financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Upon adoption of these new principles, the Companys cumulative effect of a
change in accounting principle resulted in an increase to retained earnings of $11 million. The Company had historically classified interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits as current liabilities. Beginning with the adoption of these new
principles, the Company classifies gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The total
amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of the date of adoption was $475 million, of which $209 million, if recognized, would affect the Companys effective tax rate. 
 
The Companys total gross unrecognized tax benefits are classified as non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 26, 2009, the total amount
of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $971 million, of which $307 million, if recognized, would affect the Companys effective tax rate. As of September 27, 2008, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $506 million, of
which $253 million, if recognized, would affect the Companys effective tax rate. 
 
On May 27, 2009, the United
States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued its ruling in the case of 
Xilinx, Inc. v. Commissioner
, holding that stock-based compensation is required to be included in certain transfer pricing arrangements between a U.S. company
and its offshore subsidiary. As a result of the ruling in this case, the Company increased its liability for unrecognized tax benefits by approximately $86 million and decreased shareholders equity by approximately $78 million in the year
ended September 26, 2009. 
 
The aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes
interest and penalties, for the two years ended September 26, 2009, is as follows (in millions):

The Companys policy to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized
tax benefits within the provision for income taxes did not change as a result of adopting the new accounting principles on accounting for uncertain tax positions in 2008. As of the date of adoption, the Company had accrued $203 million for the gross
interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits. As of September 26, 2009 and September 27, 2008, the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $291 million and $219 million, respectively, which is classified as
non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In 2009 and 2008, the Company recognized interest expense in connection with tax matters of $64 million and $16 million, respectively. 
 
The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign
jurisdictions. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, all years prior to 2002 are closed. The years 2002-2003 have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) and disputed issues have been taken

 
 


77 






Table of Contents



to administrative appeals. The IRS is currently examining the 2004-2006 years. In addition, the Company is also subject to audits by state, local and foreign tax authorities. In major states
and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 1988 and 2000, respectively, generally remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities. 
 
Management believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues
addressed in the Companys tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs. Although timing of the
resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce its unrecognized tax benefits by between $105 million and $145 million in the next 12 months.

 
Note 7  Shareholders Equity and Stock-Based Compensation 
 
Preferred Stock 
 
The Company has five million shares of authorized
preferred stock, none of which is issued or outstanding. Under the terms of the Companys Restated Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors is authorized to determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the
Companys authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock. 
 
Comprehensive Income 
 
Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue,
expenses, gains and losses that under GAAP are recorded as an element of shareholders equity but are excluded from net income. The Companys other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those
subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash
flow hedges. 
 
The following table summarizes the components of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of taxes, as of the
three years ended September 26, 2009 (in millions):

respectively. 
 
Employee Benefit Plans 
 
2003 Employee Stock Plan 
 
The 2003 Employee Stock Plan (the 2003 Plan) is a shareholder
approved plan that provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers. The 2003 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, stock purchase rights
and performance-based awards. Based on the terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 2003 Plan generally expire seven to ten years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based on
continued employment, with either annual, semi-annual or quarterly vesting. In general, RSUs granted under the 2003 Plan vest over two to four years, are subject to the employees continued employment and do not have an expiration date. As of
September 26, 2009, approximately 37 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2003 Plan. 
 
1997 Employee
Stock Option Plan 
 
In August 1997, the Companys Board of Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Option
Plan (the 1997 Plan), a non-shareholder approved plan for grants of stock options to employees who are not officers of the Company. Based on the terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 1997 Plan generally expire
seven to ten years after the grant date. All stock options granted under the 1997 Plan are fully vested. In October 2003, the Company terminated the 1997 Plan, and no new options can be granted from this plan. 
 
1997 Director Stock Option Plan 
 
In August 1997, the Companys Board of Directors adopted a Director Stock Option Plan (the Director Plan) for non-employee directors of the Company, which was approved by
shareholders in 1998. Pursuant to the Director Plan, the Companys non-employee directors are granted an option to acquire 30,000 shares of common stock upon their initial election to the Board (Initial Options). The Initial Options
vest and become exercisable in three equal annual installments on each of the first through third anniversaries of the grant date. On the fourth anniversary of a non-employee directors initial election to the Board and on each subsequent
anniversary thereafter, the director will be entitled to receive an option to acquire 10,000 shares of common stock (Annual Options). Annual Options are fully vested and immediately exercisable on their date of grant. Options granted
under the Director Plan expire ten years after the grant date. As of September 26, 2009, approximately 240,000 shares were reserved for future issuance under the Director Plan. 
 
Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans 
 
As of October 16, 2009, executive
officers Timothy D. Cook, Ronald B. Johnson, Peter Oppenheimer, Philip W. Schiller and Bertrand Serlet have entered into trading plans pursuant to Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). A
trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Companys stock including the exercise and sale of employee
stock options and shares acquired pursuant to the Companys employee stock purchase plan and upon vesting of RSUs. 
 
Employee Stock
Purchase Plan 
 
The Company has a shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan (the Purchase Plan),
under which substantially all employees may purchase common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values as of the beginning and end of six-month offering periods. Stock purchases

 
 


79 






Table of Contents



under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of an employees compensation, up to a maximum of $25,000 in any calendar year. The number of shares authorized to be purchased in any calendar
year is limited to a total of 3 million shares. As of September 26, 2009, approximately 4.7 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan. 
 
Employee Savings Plan 
 
The Company has an employee savings plan (the
Savings Plan) qualifying as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the Savings Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the IRS annual
contribution limit ($16,500 for calendar year 2009). The Company matches 50% to 100% of each employees contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employees eligible earnings. The Companys matching
contributions to the Savings Plan were $59 million, $50 million and $39 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 
 
Restricted Stock
Units 
 
Historically, the Company used equity awards in the form of stock options as one of the means for recruiting and
retaining highly skilled talent. In conjunction with the Companys 2009 equity compensation program changes, it began issuing primarily RSUs rather than stock options for eligible employees as the primary type of long-term equity-based award. A
summary of the Companys RSU activity and related information for the three years ended September 26, 2009, is as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):

The fair value as of the vesting date of RSUs that vested was $221 million, $320
million and $6 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Upon vesting, the RSUs are generally net share-settled to cover the required withholding tax and the remaining amount is converted into an equivalent number of shares of common stock. The
majority of RSUs vested in 2009, 2008 and 2007, were net-share settled such that the Company withheld shares with value equivalent to the employees minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted
the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 707,000, 857,000 and 20,000 for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their vesting date as determined by the
Companys closing stock price. Total payments for the employees tax obligations to the taxing authorities were $82 million, $124 million and $3 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within
the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These net-share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the Company as they reduced and retired the number of shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting and did
not represent an expense to the Company.

Aggregate intrinsic value represents the value of the Companys closing stock
price on the last trading day of the fiscal period in excess of the weighted-average exercise price multiplied by the number of options outstanding or exercisable. The aggregate intrinsic value excludes the effect of stock options that have a zero
or negative intrinsic value. Total intrinsic value of options at time of exercise was $827 million, $2.0 billion and $1.3 billion for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 
 
RSUs granted are deducted from the shares available for grant under the Companys stock option plans utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. Similarly, RSUs cancelled are added
back to the shares available for grant under the Companys stock option plans utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs cancelled. Outstanding RSU balances are not included in the outstanding options balances in the stock option

Stock-based compensation cost for RSUs is measured based on the closing fair market value of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation cost for stock options is
estimated at the grant

date based on each options fair-value as calculated by the BSM option-pricing model. The BSM option-pricing model incorporates various assumptions including expected volatility, expected
life and interest rates. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Companys common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Companys stock options and other
relevant factors including implied volatility in market traded options on the Companys common stock. The Company bases its expected life assumption on its historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards it grants to
employees. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation cost as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. 
 
The weighted-average assumptions used for the three years ended September 26, 2009, and the resulting estimates of weighted-average fair value per share of options granted and of employee stock
purchase plan rights (stock purchase rights) during those periods are as follows:

(a)


 
In conjunction with the Companys 2009 equity compensation program changes, it began issuing primarily RSUs rather than stock options to
employees, although the Company continues to grant stock options to non-employee directors. Accordingly the weighted average expected life of stock options was influenced by non-employee director stock option grants, which had a ten-year expected
life. The weighted average expected life of stock options also affects the resulting interest rate and expected volatility assumptions. 
 
The following table provides a summary of the stock-based compensation expense included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three years ended September 26, 2009 (in millions):

Stock-based compensation expense capitalized as software development costs was not
significant as of September 26, 2009 or September 27, 2008. The income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation expense was $266 million, $169 million and $81 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The total unrecognized
compensation cost related to stock options and RSUs expected to vest was $1.4 billion as of September 26, 2009, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.53 years. 
 
Note 8  Commitments and Contingencies 
 
Lease Commitments 
 
The Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under
noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any other off-balance sheet financing arrangements. The

Table of Contents



major facility leases are generally for terms of one to 20 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of one to five additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms of five to
20 years, the majority of which are for ten years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of September 26, 2009, the Companys total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $1.9 billion, of which
$1.5 billion related to leases for retail space. 
 
Rent expense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and
noncancelable leases, was $231 million, $207 million and $151 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of one year as of September 26,
2009, are as follows (in millions):

Accrued Warranty and Indemnifications 
 
The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period for hardware products is typically one year from the date of purchase
by the end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the Companys hardware products. The Company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product
warranties at the time related revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical and projected
warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Companys typical experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting warranty liabilities and
adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates. For products accounted for under subscription accounting, the Company recognizes warranty expense as incurred. 
 
The Company periodically provides updates to its applications and system software to maintain the softwares compliance with published
specifications. The estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for as warranty costs that are recognized at the time related software revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates
include the number of units delivered, the number of updates expected to occur, and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates. 
 
The following table reconciles changes in the Companys accrued warranties and related costs for the three years ended September 26, 2009 (in millions):

The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and
application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to
costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party.

 
 


83 






Table of Contents



However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of
management, does not have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results. Therefore, the Company did not record a
liability for infringement costs as of either September 26, 2009 or September 27, 2008. 
 
The Company has entered
into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status
as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these
agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. However, the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such
obligations, and payments made under these agreements historically have not materially adversely affected the Companys financial condition or operating results. 
 
Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product 
 
Although most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components including but not limited to microprocessors, enclosures, certain liquid crystal displays
(LCDs), certain optical drives and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources, which subjects the Company to significant supply and pricing risks.
Many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources including but not limited to NAND flash memory, dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and certain LCDs, are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and
significant commodity pricing fluctuations. In addition, the Company has entered into certain agreements for the supply of key components including but not limited to microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs at favorable pricing, but there
is no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar favorable terms, or at all, upon expiration or otherwise obtain favorable pricing in the future. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks
of supply shortages and/or price increases that can materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. 
 
The Company and other participants in the personal computer, mobile communication and consumer electronics industries also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. In
addition, the Company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer, mobile communication and consumer electronics industries, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components
available from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the
suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the Companys supply of a key single-sourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, if such components were available only at
significantly higher prices, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Companys business
and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of
these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements. 
 
Significant portions of the Companys Mac computers, iPhones, iPods, logic boards and other assembled products are now manufactured by
outsourcing partners, primarily in various parts of Asia. A significant concentration of this outsourced manufacturing is currently performed by only a few of the Companys outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these
outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced supplier of components and manufacturing outsourcing for many of the Companys key products including but not limited to final assembly of substantially all of the Companys portable Mac computers,
iPhones, iPods and most of the Companys desktop products. Although

 
 


84 






Table of Contents



the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Companys operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to
meet their production commitments. The Companys purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. 
 
Long-Term Supply Agreements 
 
The Company has entered into prepaid long-term supply agreements to secure the
supply of certain inventory components. During the first quarter of 2009, a long-term supply agreement with Intel Corporation was terminated and the remaining prepaid balance of $167 million was repaid to the Company. During the second and fourth
quarters of 2009, the Company made a prepayment of $500 million to LG Display for the purchase of LCD panels and a prepayment of $500 million to Toshiba to purchase NAND flash memory, respectively. As of September 26, 2009, the Company had
a total of $1.2 billion of inventory component prepayments outstanding. 
 
Contingencies 
 
The Company is subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been
fully adjudicated, which are discussed in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading Legal Proceedings. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings
and claims that would individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results. However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. If the Company failed to prevail in any of
these legal matters or if several of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. 
 
Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental, product safety and other
regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and
regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including various countries within Europe and Asia and certain states and provinces within North America. Although the Company does not anticipate any material
adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not materially adversely affect the Companys financial condition or operating
results. 
 
Note 9
  
Segment Information and Geographic Data 
 
The Company reports segment information based on the management approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making
decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Companys reportable segments. 
 
The Company manages its business
primarily on a geographic basis. Accordingly, the Company determined its operating segments, which are generally based on the nature and location of its customers, to be the Americas, Europe, Japan, Asia-Pacific, Retail and FileMaker operations. The
Companys reportable operating segments consist of Americas, Europe, Japan and Retail operations. Other operating segments include Asia Pacific, which encompasses Australia and Asia except for Japan and the Companys FileMaker, Inc.
subsidiary. The Americas, Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific segments exclude activities related to the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries, as well as the Middle
East and Africa. The Retail segment operates Apple-owned retail stores in the U.S. and in international markets. Each reportable operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services to the same types of customers.
The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. 
 
The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers, while Retail
segment net sales are based on sales from the Companys retail stores. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to

 
 


85 






Table of Contents



third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures
are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses, such as manufacturing
costs and variances not included in standard costs, research and development, corporate marketing expenses, stock-based compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges, and other separately managed general and administrative costs.
The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. Segment assets exclude corporate assets, such as cash, short-term and long-term investments, manufacturing and corporate facilities,
miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets. Except for the Retail segment, capital asset purchases for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment. Cash payments for capital asset purchases
by the Retail segment were $369 million, $389 million and $294 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 
 
The Company has
certain retail stores that have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these
stores require substantially more investment than the Companys more typical retail stores. The Company allocates certain operating expenses associated with its high-profile stores to corporate marketing expense to reflect the estimated
Company-wide benefit. The allocation of these operating costs to corporate expense is based on the amount incurred for a high-profile store in excess of that incurred by a more typical Company retail location. The Company had opened a total of 11
high-profile stores as of September 26, 2009. Expenses allocated to corporate marketing resulting from the operations of high-profile stores were $65 million, $53 million and $39 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Report of Ernst & Young LLP, Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm 
 
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Apple Inc. 
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Apple Inc. as of September 26, 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders
equity, and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. 
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion. 
 
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the consolidated financial position of Apple Inc. at September 26, 2009, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
Apple Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of September 26, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
and our report dated October 27, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Ernst & Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 


 
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Apple Inc. 
 
We have audited Apple Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of September 26, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Apple Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit. 
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
In our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 26, 2009, based on the COSO criteria.

 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated financial statements of Apple Inc. as of and for the year ended September 26, 2009 and our report dated October 27, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
 


Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  


Apple Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively "Apple" or the "Company") design, manufacture, and market personal computers, portable digital music players,
and mobile communication devices and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, and networking solutions. The Company sells its products worldwide through its online stores, its
retail stores, its direct sales force, and third-party wholesalers, resellers, and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Mac, iPod and iPhone compatible
products including application software, printers, storage devices, speakers, headphones, and various other accessories and supplies through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to
education, consumer, creative professional, business, and government customers. 


Basis of Presentation and Preparation  


The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these
consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior year amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 


The
Company's fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Company's first quarter of fiscal year 2007 contained 13 weeks and the first quarter
of fiscal year 2006 contained 14 weeks. The Company's fiscal year 2007 ended on September 29, 2007 and included 52 weeks, while fiscal year 2006 included 53 weeks and fiscal year 2005 included
52 weeks. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years or quarters refer to the Company's fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters of those fiscal years. 


Financial Instruments  


Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments  


All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. Highly liquid investments with maturities
greater than three months at the date of purchase are classified as short-term investments. The Company's debt and marketable equity securities have been classified and accounted for as
available-for-sale. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments in debt and marketable equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates the
available-for-sale designations as of each balance sheet date. These securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a
component of shareholders' equity. The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method. 


Derivative Financial Instruments  


The Company accounts for its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value. Derivatives that are not defined as hedges in Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, 
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,
 as amended, must be adjusted to
fair value through earnings. 


For
derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative
instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction
affects 


59








 




earnings.
The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in current earnings. To receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective
in offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that are
designated as fair value hedges, the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings
in the current period. The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure of the net
investment in a foreign operation is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For forward contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes
in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this component are recognized in current earnings. 


Inventories  


Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out method, or market. If the cost of the inventories exceeds their
market value, provisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. The Company's inventories consist primarily of finished goods for all periods presented. 


Property, Plant, and Equipment  


Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which
for buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, up to 5 years for equipment, and the shorter of lease terms or 10 years for leasehold
improvements. The Company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related to
internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 5 years. Depreciation and
amortization expense on property and equipment was $249 million, $180 million, and $141 million during 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. 


Asset Retirement Obligations  


The Company records obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs in accordance with SFAS
No. 143, 
Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations
. The Company reviews legal obligations associated with the retirement of
long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. If it is determined that a legal obligation exists, the fair value of the
liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of the liability is added to the
carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. The difference between the gross expected future cash flow and its present value
is accreted over the life of the related lease as an operating expense. All of the Company's existing asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to
operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. The Company's asset retirement liability was $18 million and $15 million as of September 29, 2007 and
September 30, 2006, respectively. 


Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets  


The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, 
 
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived



60








 


 Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of.
 Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to
generate. If property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the
assets exceeds its fair market value. The Company did not record any material impairments during 2007, 2006, and 2005. 


SFAS
No. 142, 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be
amortized but rather be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. The Company performs its goodwill impairment
tests on or about August 31 of each year. The Company did not recognize any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in 2007, 2006, or 2005. The Company established reporting units based
on its current reporting structure. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit. 


SFAS
No. 142 also requires that intangible assets with definite lives be amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144. The
Company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods ranging from 2 to 10 years. 


Foreign Currency Translation  


The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its international non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in
effect at the end of each period. Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations
are credited or charged to foreign currency translation included in "accumulated other comprehensive income" in shareholders' equity. The Company's foreign manufacturing subsidiaries and certain other
international subsidiaries that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and inventories,
property, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. Gains and losses from these translations were insignificant and have been included in the Company's results of operations. 


Revenue Recognition  


Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, music products, digital content, peripherals, and service and support contracts. For any product
within these groups that either is software, or is considered software-related in accordance with the guidance in Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") No. 03-5, 
 
Applicability of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2 to
Non-Software Deliverables in an Arrangement Containing More-Than-Incidental
Software
 (e.g., Macintosh computers and iPod portable digital music players), the Company accounts for such products in accordance with the revenue recognition provisions of
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA") Statement of Position ("SOP") No. 97-2, 
Software Revenue Recognition
.
The Company applies Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 104, 
Revenue Recognition,
 for products that are not software or software-related, such
as digital content sold on the iTunes Store and certain Mac, iPod and iPhone supplies and accessories. 


The
Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered
delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For 


61








 




most
of the Company's product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain
other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If at the outset of an
arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed not to be, fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable. 


Revenue
from service and support contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the service coverage periods. These contracts typically include extended phone support, repair services,
web-based support resources, diagnostic tools, and extend the service coverage offered under the Company's one-year limited warranty. 


The
Company sells software and peripheral products obtained from other companies. The Company establishes its own pricing and retains related inventory risk, is the primary obligor in sales
transactions with its customers, and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue for the sale of products obtained from other companies
based on the gross amount billed. 


The
Company accounts for multiple element arrangements that consist only of software or software-related products in accordance with SOP No. 97-2. If a multiple-element arrangement
includes deliverables that are neither software nor software-related, the Company applies EITF No. 00-21, 
Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables,
 to determine if those deliverables constitute separate units of accounting from the SOP No. 97-2 deliverables. If the Company can separate the
deliverables, the Company applies SOP No. 97-2 to the software and software-related deliverables and applies other appropriate guidance (e.g., SAB No. 104) to the
deliverables outside the scope of SOP No. 97-2. Revenue on arrangements that include multiple elements such as hardware, software, and services is allocated to each element based on
the relative fair value of each element. Each element's allocated revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met. Fair value is generally determined by
vendor specific objective evidence ("VSOE"), which is based on the price charged when each element is sold separately. If the Company cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered
element included in a multiple-element arrangement, the Company defers revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been performed, or until fair value can objectively be determined for
any remaining undelivered elements. When the fair value of a delivered element has not been established, the Company uses the residual method to recognize revenue if the fair value of all undelivered
elements is determinable. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and
is recognized as revenue. 


The
Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other
sales programs and volume-based incentives. The estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue in the period the Company has sold the product and committed to a plan. The
Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company's historical experience. Revenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted
to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority. 


Generally,
the Company does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales or the sale of extended warranty and support contracts. When the
Company does offer specified upgrade rights, the Company defers revenue for the fair value of the specified upgrade 


62








 




right
until the future obligation is fulfilled or when the right to the specified upgrade expires. Additionally, a limited number of the Company's software products are available with maintenance
agreements that grant customers rights to unspecified future upgrades over the maintenance term on a when and if available basis. Revenue associated with such maintenance is recognized ratably over
the maintenance term. 


In
March 2007, the Company began shipping Apple TV and in June 2007 began shipping iPhone. For Apple TV and iPhone, the Company indicated it may provide future unspecified features and
additional software products free of charge to customers. Accordingly, Apple TV and iPhone handsets sales are accounted for under subscription accounting in accordance with SOP
No. 97-2. As such, the Company's policy is to defer the associated revenue and cost of goods sold at the time of sale, and recognize both on a straight-line basis over
the currently estimated 24-month economic life of these products, with any loss recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred by the Company for engineering, sales, marketing and warranty
are expensed as incurred. 


Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  


The Company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. The Company considers historical experience, the age of the accounts
receivable balances, credit quality of the Company's customers, current economic conditions, and other factors that may affect customers' ability to pay. 


Shipping Costs  


For all periods presented, amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue, and the Company's shipping and handling costs are included in
cost of sales. 


Warranty Expense  


The Company generally provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. The Company assesses the adequacy of
its preexisting warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates. For products accounted for under subscription accounting pursuant
to SOP No. 97-2, the Company recognizes warranty expense as incurred. 


Software Development Costs  


Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization
beginning when a product's technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers pursuant to SFAS No. 86, 
 
Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise
Marketed
. In most instances, the Company's products are released soon after technological feasibility
has been established. Therefore, costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally most software development costs have been expensed. 


In
2007, the Company determined that both Mac OS X Version 10.5 Leopard ("Mac OS X Leopard") and iPhone achieved technological feasibility. During 2007, the Company capitalized $75 million of
costs associated with the development of Leopard and iPhone. In accordance with SFAS No. 86, the capitalized costs related to Mac OS X Leopard and iPhone are amortized to cost of
sales commencing when each respective product begins shipping and are recognized on a straight-line basis over a 3 year estimated useful life of the underlying technology. 


63








 




Total
amortization related to capitalized software development costs was $13 million, $18 million, and $16 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. 


Advertising Costs  


Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $467 million, $338 million, and $287 million for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. 


Stock-Based Compensation  


On September 25, 2005, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) ("SFAS No. 123R"), 
Share-Based
Payment
, which addresses the accounting for stock-based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of
the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise's equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. In
January 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued SAB No. 107, which provides supplemental implementation guidance for SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R
eliminates the ability to account for stock-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method under Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, 
 
Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees
, and instead generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based
method. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton ("BSM") option-pricing model to determine the fair-value of stock-based awards under SFAS No. 123R, consistent with that used for
pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123, 
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
. 


SFAS
No. 123R prohibits recognition of a deferred tax asset for an excess tax benefit that has not been realized. The Company will recognize a benefit from stock-based compensation in equity if
an incremental tax benefit is realized by following the ordering provisions of the tax law. In addition, the Company accounts for the indirect effects of stock-based compensation on the research tax
credit, the foreign tax credit, and the domestic manufacturing deduction through the income statement. 


Prior
to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company measured compensation expense for its employee stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB Opinion
No. 25. The Company applied the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123 as amended by SFAS No. 148, 
Accounting for Stock-Based
CompensationTransition and Disclosure,
 as if the fair-value-based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense. Under APB Opinion
No. 25, when the exercise price of the Company's employee stock options was equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant, no compensation expense was recognized. 


64








 




The
following table illustrates the effect on net income after taxes and net income per common share as if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to

Earnings Per Common Share  


Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period
increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of common stock had been issued. The dilutive effect of
outstanding options, shares to be purchased under the employee stock purchase plan, unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units ("RSUs") is reflected in diluted earnings per share by
application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the Company's common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from outstanding
options, restricted stock, and RSUs. Additionally, the exercise of employee stock options and the vesting of restricted stock and RSUs can result in a greater dilutive effect on earnings per share.

2006, and September 24, 2005, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for these periods because their effect would have been antidilutive. These
potentially dilutive securities include stock options, unvested restricted stock, and RSUs. 


Comprehensive Income  


Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains, and losses that under
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders' equity but are excluded from net income. The Company's other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency
translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as
available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges. 


Segment Information  


The Company reports segment information based on the "management" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions
and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments. Information about the Company's products, major customers, and geographic areas on a company-wide basis is
also disclosed.

The
Company's U.S. Corporate securities consist primarily of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, time deposits, and corporate debt securities. Foreign securities consist primarily of foreign
commercial paper issued by foreign companies, and certificates of deposit and time deposits with foreign institutions, most of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company had $11 million
in net unrealized losses on its investment portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years, as of September 29, 2007, and net unrealized
losses of approximately $687,000 on its investment portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities less than 1 year, as of September 30, 2006. The Company may sell its
investments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. The Company recognized net gains before taxes of approximately
$474,000 in 2007 and net losses before taxes of approximately $434,000 and $137,000 in 2006 and 2005, respectively. 


As
of September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006, $1.9 billion and $921 million, respectively, of the Company's short-term investments had underlying maturities
ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remaining short-term investments as of September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006 had maturities less than 12 months.

The
unrealized losses on the Company's investments during 2007 in U.S. Corporate securities and foreign securities and during 2006 in U.S. Corporate securities were caused primarily by changes in
interest rates. The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities with strong liquidity and with low probabilities of default. The Company's investment policy requires investments to be rated
single-A or better. Therefore, the Company considers the declines to be temporary in nature. During 2007, the Company did not record any material impairment on outstanding securities. As
of September 29, 2007, the Company does not consider the investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired. 


Market
values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating the investments for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews
factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, and the Company's ability and intent to hold the investment for a
period of time, which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value. 


Accounts Receivable  


Trade Receivables  


The Company distributes its products through third-party distributors and resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and commercial customers. The Company generally
does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company requires collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit
risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Australia by arranging with third-party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements
and other loan and lease programs to the Company's direct customers. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the
Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables not 


68








 


covered
by collateral, third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Company's distribution and retail channel partners. One customer accounted for approximately 11%
of trade receivables as of September 29, 2007, while no customers accounted for more than 10% of trade receivables as of September 30, 2006.

Vendor Non-Trade Receivables  


The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors
who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these raw material components directly from suppliers. These non-trade
receivables, which are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in other current assets, totaled $2.4 billion and $1.6 billion as of September 29, 2007 and September 30,
2006, respectively. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in net sales and does not recognize any profits on these sales until the products are sold through to the end customer at
which time the profit is recognized as a reduction of cost of sales. 


Derivative Financial Instruments  


The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange risk. Foreign currency forward and option contracts are used to offset the foreign
exchange risk on certain existing assets and liabilities and to hedge the foreign exchange risk on expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales. The Company's accounting
policies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair
value.

The
notional principal amounts for derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of year-end, and do not represent the amount of the Company's
exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts shown in the table above represents the Company's gross exposure to potential accounting loss on these transactions if all counterparties
failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency exchange rates at each respective date. The Company's exposure to credit loss and market risk will
vary over time as a function of currency exchange rates. 


The
estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models and prevailing financial market information as of September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006. Although
the table above reflects the notional principal, fair value, and credit risk amounts of the Company's foreign exchange instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the
exposures and transactions that the foreign exchange instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and
losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. 


Foreign Exchange Risk Management  


The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risk associated with existing assets
and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Generally, the Company's practice is to hedge a majority of its
material foreign exchange exposures. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, or
limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments. 


To
help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company's U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and the
Company's non-U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries selling in local currencies hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries' functional currency.
Other comprehensive income associated with hedges of foreign currency revenue is recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related sales are recognized, and other comprehensive
income related to inventory purchases is recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. 


70








 




Typically,
the Company hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases over a time horizon of up to 6 months. 


Derivative
instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time
period or within a subsequent 2 month time period. Deferred gains and losses in other comprehensive income associated with such derivative instruments are immediately reclassified into earnings
in other income and expense. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are also reflected in current earnings unless they are re-designated as hedges of other
transactions. The Company recognized net gains of approximately $672,000 and $421,000 in 2007 and 2006, respectively, and a net loss of $1.6 million in 2005 in other income and expense related
to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges due to changes in the Company's forecast of future net sales and cost of sales and due to prevailing market conditions. As of
September 29, 2007, the Company had a net deferred gain associated with cash flow hedges of approximately $468,000, net of taxes, substantially all of which is expected to be reclassified to
earnings by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2008. 


The
net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument designated as a net investment hedge is included in the cumulative translation adjustment account of accumulated other
comprehensive income within shareholders' equity. For the years ended September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006, the Company had a net loss of $2.6 million and a net gain of
$7.4 million, respectively, included in the cumulative translation adjustment. 


The
Company may also enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and
liabilities recorded in non-functional currencies. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in current earnings in other income and expense as offsets to the changes
in the fair value of the related assets or liabilities. Due to currency market movements, changes in option time value can lead to increased volatility in other income and expense.

During
2006, the Company sold certain assets related to its PowerSchool web-based student information system operations. In connection with this sale, the Company reduced goodwill by
$31 million for the outstanding balance from the acquisition of PowerSchool, Inc. in 2001 and recognized a $4 million pre-tax gain, which is reflected in other income
and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

The
foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pretax earnings of $2.2 billion, $1.5 billion, and $922 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. As of
September 29, 2007, $6.5 billion of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S.
dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. The Company's consolidated financial statements provide for
any related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated, aside from undistributed earnings of certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in
operations outside the U.S. U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $2.4 billion of such earnings. It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that
might be incurred if these earnings were to be distributed. 


Deferred
tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits, and the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts
of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected
to be recovered or settled.

As
of September 29, 2007, the Company has tax loss and credit carryforwards in the tax effected amount of $8 million. As of September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006, a
valuation allowance of $5 million was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of state operating losses that may not be realized. Management believes it is more likely than not
that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to
fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets.

The
Company's income taxes payable have been reduced by the tax benefits from employee stock options. The Company receives an income tax benefit calculated as the difference between the fair market
value of the stock issued at the time of the exercise and the option price, tax effected. The net tax benefits from employee stock option transactions were $398 million, $419 million,
and $428 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, and were reflected as an increase to common stock in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity.

The
Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has completed its field audit of the Company's federal income tax returns for the years 2002 through 2003 and proposed certain adjustments. The Company intends to
contest certain of these adjustments through the IRS Appeals Office. All IRS audit issues for years prior to 2002 have been resolved. In addition, the Company is also subject to audits by state,
local, and foreign tax authorities. Management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be
predicted with certainty. Should any issues addressed in the Company's tax audits be resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its
provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs. In 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded tax benefits of $63 million and $20 million, respectively, due to the settlement of
prior year tax audits in the U.S. 


Note 6Shareholders' Equity  


Preferred Stock  


The Company has five million shares of authorized preferred stock, none of which is issued or outstanding. Under the terms of the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation,
the Board of Directors is authorized to determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the Company's authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock. 


Restricted Stock Units  


The Company's Board of Directors has granted RSUs to members of the Company's management team, excluding its CEO. These RSUs generally vest over four years either at the end of
the four-year service period, in two equal installments on the second and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant, or in equal installments on each of the first through fourth
anniversaries of the grant date. Upon vesting, the RSUs will convert into an equivalent number of shares of common stock. The compensation expense incurred by the Company for RSUs is based on the
closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant and is amortized ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The RSUs have been reflected in
the calculation of diluted earnings per share utilizing the treasury stock method. 


During
2007 and 2006, 45,000 and 2.47 million, respectively, previously granted RSUs vested. A majority of these vested RSUs were net-share settled such that the Company withheld
shares with value equivalent to the employees' minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total
shares withheld of approximately 20,000 and 990,000 for 2007 and 2006, respectively, was based on the value of the RSUs on their vesting date as determined by the Company's closing stock price. Total
payments for the employees' tax obligations to the taxing authorities were $3 million and $59 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within the
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These net-share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the Company as they reduced and retired the number of shares that would have
otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting and did not represent an expense to the Company. 


CEO Restricted Stock Award  


On March 19, 2003, the Company's Board of Directors granted 10 million shares of restricted stock to the Company's CEO that vested on March 19, 2006. The
amount of the restricted stock award expensed by the Company was based on the closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant and was amortized ratably on a
straight-line basis over the three-year requisite service period. Upon vesting during 2006, the 10 million shares of restricted stock had a fair value of
$646.6 million and had grant-date fair value of $7.48 per share. The restricted stock award was net-share settled such that the Company withheld shares with value
equivalent to the CEO's minimum statutory obligation for the applicable 


76








 


income
and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld of 4.6 million were based on the value of the restricted stock award on
the vesting date as determined by the Company's closing stock price of $64.66. The remaining shares net of those withheld were delivered to the Company's CEO. Total payments for the CEO's tax
obligations to the taxing authorities was $296 million in 2006 and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The net-share settlement
had the effect of share repurchases by the Company as it reduced and retired the number of shares outstanding and did not represent an expense to the Company. The Company's CEO has no remaining shares
of restricted stock. For the years ended September 30, 2006 and September 24, 2005, compensation expense related to restricted stock was $4.6 million and $24.9 million,
respectively. 


Stock Repurchase Plan  


In July 1999, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does
not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time. The Company has repurchased a total of 13.1 million shares at a cost of
$217 million under this plan and was authorized to repurchase up to an additional $283 million of its common stock as of September 29, 2007. 


Comprehensive Income  


Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains, and losses that under
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders' equity but are excluded from net income. The Company's other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency
translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as
available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges.

Employee Benefit Plans  


2003 Employee Stock Plan  


The 2003 Employee Stock Plan (the "2003 Plan") is a shareholder approved plan that provides for broad-based grants to employees, including executive officers. Based on the
terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 2003 Plan generally expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based on
continued employment, with either annual or quarterly vesting. The 2003 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, stock
purchase rights and performance-based awards.
During 2007, the Company's shareholders approved an amendment to the 2003 Plan to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance by 28 million shares. 


1997 Employee Stock Option Plan  


In August 1997, the Company's Board of Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the "1997 Plan"), a non-shareholder approved plan for grants
of stock options to employees who are not officers of the Company. Based on the terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 1997 Plan generally expire 7 to 10 years after the
grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based on continued employment, with either annual or quarterly vesting. In October 2003, the Company terminated the 1997
Plan and no new options can be granted from this plan. 


1997 Director Stock Option Plan  


In August 1997, the Company's Board of Directors adopted a Director Stock Option Plan (the "Director Plan") for non-employee directors of the Company, which
was approved by shareholders in 1998. Pursuant to the Director Plan, the Company's non-employee directors are granted an option to acquire 30,000 shares of common stock upon their initial
election to the Board ("Initial Options
"
). The Initial Options vest and become exercisable in three equal annual installments on each of the first
through third anniversaries of the grant date. On the fourth anniversary of a non-employee director's initial election to the Board and on each subsequent anniversary thereafter, the
director will be entitled to receive an option to acquire 10,000 shares of common stock ("Annual Options"). Annual Options are fully vested and immediately exercisable on their date of grant. 


Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans  


Certain of the Company's executive officers, including Mr. Timothy D. Cook, Mr. Peter Oppenheimer, Mr. Philip W. Schiller, and Dr. Bertrand Serlet,
have entered into trading plans pursuant to 


78








 


Rule 10b5-1(c)(1)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. A trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula
for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company's stock including the exercise and sale of employee stock options and shares acquired pursuant to the
Company's employee stock purchase plan and upon vesting of RSUs. 


Employee Stock Purchase Plan  


The Company has a shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan (the "Purchase Plan"), under which substantially all employees may purchase common stock through payroll
deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values as of the beginning and end of six-month offering periods. Stock purchases under the Purchase Plan are limited to
10% of an employee's compensation, up to a maximum of $25,000 in any calendar year. During 2007, the Company's shareholders approved an amendment to the Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares
authorized for issuance by 6 million shares and limit the number of shares that may be purchased in any calendar year to 3 million shares. As of September 29, 2007, approximately
7 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan. 


Employee Savings Plan  


The Company has an employee savings plan (the "Savings Plan") qualifying as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the
Savings Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limit ($15,500 for calendar year 2007). The
Company matches 50% to 100% of each employee's contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employee's eligible earnings. The Company's matching contributions to the
Savings Plan were $39 million, $33 million, and $28 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

Aggregate intrinsic value represents the value of the Company's closing stock price on the last trading day of the fiscal period in excess of the exercise price
multiplied by the number of options outstanding or exercisable. Total intrinsic value of options at time of exercise was $1.3 billion, $1.2 billion, and $1.1 billion for 2007,
2006, and 2005, respectively. 


The
Company recognized $242 million, $163 million and $49 million of stock-based compensation expense in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Capitalized stock-based compensation
costs were $9 million as of September 29, 2007. There were no stock-based compensation costs capitalized as of September 30, 2006. The income tax benefit related to stock-based
compensation expense was $81 million and $39 million for the years ended September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006, respectively. The total unrecognized compensation cost
related to stock options and RSUs expected to vest was $631 million and $375 million as of September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006, respectively. The total unrecognized
compensation cost as of September 29, 2007, is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.92 years. 


80










 
 


Note 6Shareholders' Equity (Continued)  


As of September 29, 2007, the Company had 4.7 million RSUs outstanding with a total grant-date fair value of $249 million that were excluded
from the options outstanding balances in the preceding table. The weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted during 2007, 2006, and 2005 was $88.51 per share, $70.92 per share, and $45.04
per share, respectively. Aggregate intrinsic value of RSUs was $701.3 million and $262.5 million at September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006, respectively. RSUs that
vested during 2007 and 2006 totaled 45,000 and 2.47 million, respectively, and had a fair value of $6.1 million and $148.5 million, respectively, as of the vesting date. Shares of
RSUs granted after April 2005 have been deducted from the shares available for grant under the Company's stock option plans utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. 


Note 7Stock-Based Compensation  


The Company has provided pro forma disclosures in Note 1 of the effect on net income and earnings per share for the year ended September 24, 2005 as if the fair
value method of accounting for stock-based compensation had been used for its employee stock option grants and employee stock purchase plan purchases. These pro forma effects have been estimated at
the date of grant and beginning of the period, respectively, using the BSM option-pricing model. 


The
Company uses the BSM option-pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock-based awards. The BSM option-pricing model incorporates various assumptions including expected volatility, expected
life, and interest rates. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company's common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the
Company's stock options and other relevant factors including implied volatility in market traded options on the Company's common stock. The Company bases its expected life assumption on its historical
experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards it grants to employees. Stock-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award's fair-value as
calculated by the BSM option-pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. 


The
weighted average assumptions used for 2007, 2006, and 2005 and the resulting estimates of weighted-average fair value per share of options granted and for stock purchases during those periods are
as follows:

Note 8Commitments and Contingencies  


Lease Commitments  


The Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any other
off-balance sheet financing arrangements. The major facility leases are generally for terms of 3 to 15 years and generally 


81








 


provide
renewal options for terms of 3 to 7 additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms of 5 to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain
multi-year renewal options. As of September 29, 2007, the Company's total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $1.4 billion, of which
$1.1 billion related to leases for retail space. 


Rent
expense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $151 million, $138 million, and $140 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005,
respectively. Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of one year as of September 29, 2007, are as follows (in millions):

Accrued Warranty and Indemnifications  


The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period for hardware products is typically one year from the date of
purchase by the end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the Company's hardware products. The Company provides currently
for the estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product warranties at the time related revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals for product
warranty obligations include the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected
cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company's typical experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting warranty
liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates. For products accounted for under subscription accounting pursuant to SOP
No. 97-2, the Company recognizes warranty expense as incurred. 


The
Company periodically provides updates to its applications and system software to maintain the software's compliance with specifications. The estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for
as warranty costs that are recognized at the time related software revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units
delivered, the number of updates expected to occur, and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates.

The
Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property
rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim
against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against itself or an
indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a material adverse
effect on its financial condition or operating results. Therefore, the Company did not record a liability for infringement costs as of either September 29, 2007 or September 30, 2006. 


Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product  


Certain key components including, but not limited to, microprocessors, enclosures, certain LCDs, certain optical drives, and application-specific integrated circuits ("ASICs")
are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources which subjects the Company to supply and pricing risks. Many of these and other key components that are available from multiple
sources including, but not limited to, NAND flash memory, DRAM memory, and certain LCDs, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. In
addition, the Company has entered into certain agreements for the supply of critical components at favorable pricing, and there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these
agreements when they expire. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and/or price increases that can adversely affect gross margins and operating margins. In
addition, the Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the global personal computer, consumer electronics and mobile communication industries, and new products introduced by the
Company often utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers. If the supply of a
key single-sourced component to the Company were to be delayed or curtailed, or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company's ability to
ship related products in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely affected. The Company's business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time
required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components may be
affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements. Finally, significant portions of the
Company's CPUs, iPods, iPhones, logic boards, and other assembled products are now manufactured by outsourcing partners, primarily in various parts of Asia. A significant concentration of this
outsourced manufacturing is currently performed by only a few of the Company's outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced
supplier of components and manufacturing outsourcing for many of the Company's key products, including but not limited to, assembly 


83








 


of
most of the Company's portable Mac computers, iPods, and iPhones. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company's operating results could
be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. 


Long-Term Supply Agreements  


During the first quarter of 2006, the Company entered into long-term supply agreements with Hynix Semiconductor, Inc., Intel Corporation, Micron
Technology, Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and Toshiba Corporation to secure supply of NAND flash memory through calendar year 2010. As part of these agreements, the Company
prepaid $1.25 billion for flash memory components during 2006, which will be applied to certain inventory purchases made over the life of each respective agreement. The Company utilized
$208 million of the prepayment as of September 29, 2007. 


Contingencies  


The Company is subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully adjudicated. In the opinion of
management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its
financial condition or operating results. However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should
several of these legal matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. 


Production
and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers
the ability to return product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been
passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates including various countries within Europe and Asia, certain Canadian provinces and certain states within the U.S. Although the Company
does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not
have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or operating results. 


Note 9Segment Information and Geographic Data  


In accordance with SFAS No. 131, 
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information
, the Company reports
segment information based on the "management" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the
Company's reportable segments.

Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. Accordingly, the Company determined its operating segments, which are generally based on the nature and location of its customers, to
be the Americas, Europe, Japan, Asia-Pacific, Retail, and FileMaker operations. The Company's four geographical segments, together with the Retail segment, all sell the same products to
the same types of customers. The Company's reportable operating segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail operations. The Americas, Europe, and Japan reportable segments
exclude activities related to the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The
Retail segment operates Apple-owned retail stores in the U.S., Canada, Japan, the U.K. and Italy. Other operating segments include 


84








 




Asia-Pacific,
which includes Australia and Asia except for Japan, and the Company's subsidiary, FileMaker, Inc. Each reportable geographic operating segment provides similar
hardware and software products, similar services and the accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1. 


The
Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of the customers, and net
sales for the Retail segment are based on sales from the Company's retail stores. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses
directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other
income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as manufacturing costs and
variances not included in standard costs, research and development, corporate marketing expenses, stock-based compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges, and other separately
managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. Segment assets exclude corporate assets such as cash,
short-term and long-term investments, manufacturing facilities, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets, and retail store
construction-in-progress not subject to depreciation. Except for the Retail segment, capital asset purchases for long-lived assets are not reported to management by
segment. Capital asset purchases by the Retail segment were $294 million, $200 million, and $132 million for 2007, 2006, and 2005 respectively. 


From
the establishment of the Retail segment in fiscal 2001 through the quarter ended March 31, 2007, Company management assessed the segment's operating performance differently from the
Company's other operating segments. Because the Company's Retail initiative was an unproven concept at inception, management chose to measure the Retail segment's performance in a manner that would
allow comparability to the Company's major channel partners operating retail stores in the U.S. There were three significant differences in the measurement of the Retail segment's results relative to
the Company's other operating segments. First, the Retail segment's operating income reflected cost of sales for Apple products at amounts normally charged to Apple's major U.S. channel partners for
the same products, less the cost of the Company's sales programs and other costs to support those partners. Second, the cost of sales of the Company's service and support contracts, including the
AppleCare Protection Plan ("APP") and .Mac, were reflected in the Retail segment's results at the costs charged to major channel partners for such contracts, and all associated revenue was reflected
in the Retail segment's results at the time of sale rather than being amortized over the lives of the respective agreements. Because the Company had not yet earned the revenue or incurred the cost
associated with the sale of such contracts, an offset to these amounts was recognized in other segments' net sales and cost of sales. Third, the Company allocated certain expenses related to the
operation of its high-profile stores to corporate marketing expense. 


Having
operated the Company's Retail stores successfully for more than six years, management believes its Retail initiative is a proven concept that will continue to be an integral element of the
Company's distribution and marketing strategies. Additionally, the Company expects sales of iPhone by the Company's geographic and Retail operating segments to generate significant levels of deferred
revenue and deferred cost of sales over time. In consideration of these factors, management has determined that beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2007, aligning measurements for the
performance of the Retail segment with those used for the Company's other operating segments provides the most meaningful information. Accordingly, management has begun to measure the Retail segment's
operating performance in a manner 


85








 




generally
consistent with the Company's other operating segments. The cost of sales of the Company's products sold through the Retail segment is now reflected at amounts similar to the cost of sales
of the same products reflected in the Company's other operating segments. Revenue from APP and .Mac contracts sold through the Retail segment is now being recognized over the lives of the respective
service agreements. Additionally, the Retail segment is applying the same subscription accounting to iPhone net sales and cost of sales that the Company's other operating segments apply. Management
believes aligning measurements for the performance of the Retail segment with those used for the Company's other operating segments will provide greater comparability with the rest of the Company's
segments and allow for more meaningful assessment of the Retail segment's operating results. The Company has reclassified prior period operating segment results to reflect these changes in the
measurement of the operating results for the Retail segment, along with the corresponding offsetting impact to the Company's other operating segments. 


The
Company will continue to allocate certain operating expenses associated with its high-profile stores to corporate marketing expense to reflect the estimated Company-wide
benefit. These high-profile stores are larger than the Company's typical retail stores and were designed to further promote brand awareness and provide a venue for certain corporate sales
and marketing activities, including corporate briefings. The allocation of these operating costs to corporate expense is based on the amount incurred for a high-profile store in excess of
that incurred by a more typical Company retail location. The Company had opened a total of eight high-profile stores as of September 29, 2007. Expenses allocated to corporate
marketing resulting from the operations of high-profile stores were $39 million, $33 million, and $31 million for the years ended September 29, 2007,
September 30, 2006, and September 24, 2005 respectively.

Note 10Related Party Transactions and Certain Other Transactions  


The Company entered into a Reimbursement Agreement with its CEO, Steve Jobs, for the reimbursement of expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs in the operation of his private plane
when used for Apple business. The Company recognized a total of approximately $776,000, $202,000, and $1,100,000 in expenses pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement during 2007, 2006, and 2005,
respectively. 


In
2006, the Company entered into an agreement with Pixar to sell certain of Pixar's short films on the iTunes Store. Mr. Jobs was the CEO, Chairman, and a large shareholder of Pixar. On
May 5, 2006, The Walt Disney Company ("Disney") acquired Pixar, which resulted in Pixar becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Disney. Upon Disney's acquisition of Pixar, Mr. Jobs' shares
of Pixar common stock were exchanged for Disney's common stock and he was elected to the Disney Board of Directors. Royalty expense recognized by the Company under the arrangement with Pixar from
September 25, 2005 through May 5, 2006 was less than $1 million.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  


The
Board of Directors and Shareholders

Apple Inc.: 


We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 29, 2007. These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. 


We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 


In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Apple Inc. and subsidiaries as of
September 29, 2007 and September 30, 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 29,
2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 


As
discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, effective September 25, 2005, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123R, 
Share-Based Payment
. 


We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Apple Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of
September 29, 2007, based on criteria established in 
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated November 15, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial
reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  


The
Board of Directors and Shareholders

Apple Inc.: 


We
have audited Apple Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2007, based on criteria established in 
Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)
.

Apple's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included
in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit. 


We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit
also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 


A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 


Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 


In
our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2007, based on criteria established in 
 
Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework
 issued by COSO. 


We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September 29,
2007 and September 30, 2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
September 29, 2007, and our report dated November 15, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements
.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
 


Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  


Apple
Computer, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) designs, manufactures and markets personal computers and related software, peripherals and personal computing and communicating
solutions. The Company's products include the Macintosh line of desktop and notebook computers, the Mac OS X operating system, the iPod digital music player, and a portfolio of software products and
peripherals for education, creative, consumer and business customers. The Company sells its products through its online stores, direct sales force, third-party wholesalers and resellers, and its own
retail stores. 


Basis of Presentation and Preparation  


The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these
consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior year amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 


Typically,
the Company's fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of September. Fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001 were each 52-week years. However, approximately every six years, the Company
reports a 53-week fiscal year to align its fiscal quarters with calendar quarters by adding a week to its first fiscal quarter. All information presented herein is based on the Company's
fiscal calendar. 


Financial Instruments  


Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments  


The Company places its short-term investments in highly liquid securities issued by high credit quality issuers. All highly liquid investments with maturities of
three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents; highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as short-term
investments. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments in debt and marketable equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each
balance sheet date. The Company's debt and marketable equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. These securities are carried at fair
value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of shareholders' equity. The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method. 


Non-Current Debt and Equity Investments  


The Company has made investments in non-current debt and equity investments of public and privately held companies that have been reflected in the consolidated
balance sheets as long-term assets within other assets. They are not categorized as current assets either because, given their nature, they are not readily convertible into cash or because
they represent potentially longer-term investments by the Company. Further, the fair value of these investments has been subject to a high degree of volatility. The Company's
non-current debt and equity investments have been categorized as available-for-sale requiring that they be carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses,
net of taxes, reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. However, the Company recognizes an impairment charge to earnings in the event a decline in fair value below
the cost basis of one of these investments is determined to be other-than-temporary. The Company includes recognized gains and losses resulting from the sale or from
other-than-temporary declines in fair value associated with these investments in other income and expense. Occasionally, the Company uses short-term equity
derivatives to 


60






 


manage
potential dispositions of non-current debt and equity investments. Any gains or losses associated with such derivatives are recognized currently in other income and expense. 


Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity  


On May 15, 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 150, 
 
Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of
Both Liabilities and Equity
. SFAS No. 150 requires issuers to classify as
liabilities (or assets in some circumstances) certain freestanding financial instruments that embody obligations for the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The Company
adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 150 on June 29, 2003, which resulted in a favorable cumulative-effect type adjustment of approximately $3 million. This adjustment related to a
forward purchase agreement that allowed the Company to acquire 1.5 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $16.64 per share for a total cost of $25.5 million. The
Company settled this forward purchase agreement in August 2003, which resulted in an additional gain of approximately $6 million representing the increase in fair value of the agreement
from June 29, 2003 through the settlement date. 


Derivative Financial Instruments  


On October 1, 2000, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133, 
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities
. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, hedging activities, and exposure definition. SFAS No. 133
requires that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income. If the derivative is a hedge,
depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings, or
recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Net of the related income tax effect of approximately $5 million, adoption of SFAS No. 133
resulted in a favorable cumulative-effect type adjustment to net income of approximately $12 million. Net of the related income tax effect of approximately $5 million, adoption of SFAS
No. 133 resulted in a favorable cumulative-effect-type adjustment to other comprehensive income of approximately $12 million, all of which was reclassified to earnings during
2001. Management does not believe that ongoing application of SFAS No. 133 will significantly alter the Company's hedging strategies. However, its application may increase the volatility of
other income and expense and other comprehensive income. 


For
derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are attributable to a particular risk and that are designated as cash flow hedges, the net gain or
loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged
transaction affects earnings. To receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. For
derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability or an identified portion thereof that are attributable to a particular risk and that are
designated as fair value hedges, the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings
in the current period. The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure of the net
investment in a foreign operation is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For forward contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes
in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this component are recognized in current 


61






 




earnings.
For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in the current period. 


For
foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges, hedge effectiveness is measured based on changes in the fair value of the contract attributable to changes in the forward
exchange rate. Changes in the expected future cash flows on the forecasted hedged transaction and changes in the fair value of the forward hedge are both measured from the contract rate to the forward
exchange rate associated with the forward contract's maturity date. For currency option contracts, hedge effectiveness is measured based on changes in the total fair value of the option contract.
Hedge effectiveness is assessed by comparing the present value of the cumulative change in expected future cash flows on the hedged transaction to changes in expected cash flow of the option hedge at
maturity. The net gains or losses on derivative instruments qualifying as cash flow hedges are reported as components of other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity and reclassified into
earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any hedge ineffectiveness is recognized in current earnings in other income and expense. For interest rate
swap agreements qualifying as fair value hedges, the Company assumes no ineffectiveness because these swaps meet the criteria for accounting under the short-cut method defined in SFAS
No. 133. 


Inventories  


Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. If the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are
made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. 


Property, Plant, and Equipment  


Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use of the declining balance and straight-line methods over the estimated useful
lives of the assets, which are 30 years for buildings, from 2 to 5 years for equipment, and the shorter of lease terms or 10 years for leasehold improvements. The Company
capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related to internal-use
software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 5 years. 


Asset Retirement Obligations  


On September 29, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 143, 
Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations
, which
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. The standard applies to
legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. SFAS No. 143
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of
the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. All of the Company's existing asset retirement
obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. The Company estimated that as of September 29, 2002,
gross expected future cash flows of $9.5 million would be required to fulfill these obligations. 


62






 


As
of the date of adoption, the Company recorded a $6 million long-term asset retirement liability and a corresponding increase in leasehold improvements. This amount represents the
present value of expected future cash flows associated with returning certain of the Company's leased properties to original condition. The difference between the gross expected future cash flow of
$9.5 million and its present value of $6 million at September 29, 2002, is being accreted over the life of the related leases as an operating expense. Net of the related income
tax effect of approximately $1 million, adoption of SFAS No. 143 resulted in an unfavorable cumulative-effect type adjustment to net income during the first quarter of 2003 of
approximately $2 million. This adjustment represents cumulative depreciation and accretion that would have been recognized through the date of adoption of SFAS No. 143 had the statement
been applied to the Company's existing asset retirement obligations at the time they were initially incurred.

Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets  


The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to
generate. If property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the
assets exceeds its fair market value. For the three years ended September 27, 2003, the Company has made no material adjustments to its long-lived assets, except those made in
connection with the restructuring actions described in Note 5. 


The
Company adopted SFAS No. 142, 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
, in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. SFAS No. 142 requires that
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that they may be impaired. Prior to fiscal 2002, goodwill was amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life. The Company completed its transitional
goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2001, and its annual goodwill impairment tests at August 30, 2003 and August 30, 2002, respectively, and found no impairment. The Company
established reporting units based on its current reporting structure. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to
each reporting unit. 


SFAS
No. 142 also requires that intangible assets with definite lives be amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, 
 
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of
. The Company is currently
amortizing its acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods ranging from 3 to 10 years. 


Foreign Currency Translation  


The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its international non-U.S. functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at
the end of each period. Revenue and 


63






 


expenses
for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are credited or charged to foreign currency
translation included in "accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" in shareholders' equity. The Company's foreign manufacturing subsidiaries and certain other international subsidiaries that use
the U.S. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and inventories, property, and nonmonetary assets and
liabilities at historical rates. Gains and losses from these translations were insignificant and have been included in the Company's results of operations. 


Revenue Recognition  


Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of products (hardware, software, and peripherals), and extended warranty and support contracts. The Company recognizes
revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards, including Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97-2, 
Software Revenue Recognition
, as
amended, and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, 
Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements
. 


The
Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered
delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Company's product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped.
For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the United States, and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the
Company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed to not be,
fixed and determinable, revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable. 


Revenue
from extended warranty and support contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the warranty and support periods. These contracts typically include extended phone support, certain
repairs, web-based support resources, diagnostic tools, and extend the Company's one-year basic limited parts and labor warranty. 


The
Company sells software and peripheral products obtained from other companies. The Company establishes its own pricing and retains related inventory risk, is the primary obligor in sales
transactions with its customers, and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue for the sale of products obtained from other companies at
the gross amount billed. 


Revenue
on arrangements that include multiple elements such as hardware, software, and services is allocated to each element based on vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of the fair value of
each element. Allocated revenue for each element is recognized when revenue recognition criteria have been met for each element. VSOE is determined based on the price charged when each element is sold
separately. 


The
Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end user rebates, and other sales programs
and volume-based incentives. The estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue in the period the Company has sold the product and committed to a plan. The Company also records
reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company's historical experience. 


64






 




Generally,
the Company does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales or the sale of extended warranty and support contracts. However, a
limited number of the Company's software products are available with maintenance agreements that grant customers rights to unspecified future upgrades over the maintenance term on a when and if
available basis. Revenue associated with such maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term. 


Shipping Costs  


The Company's shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales for all periods presented. 


Warranty Expense  


The Company provides currently for the estimated cost for product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. 


Research and Development  


Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning
when a product's technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers pursuant to SFAS No. 86, 
Computer
Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed
. In most instances, the Company's products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. Therefore,
costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally all software development costs have been expensed. 


During
the third and fourth quarters of 2003, the Company incurred substantial development costs associated with the development of Mac OS X version 10.3 (code-named "Panther"), which
enhances the features and functionality of the previous version of Mac OS X, subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility as evidenced by public demonstration and release of a developer beta
in June 2003, and prior to release of the final version of the product in the first quarter of 2004. Therefore, during 2003 the Company capitalized approximately $14.7 million of
development costs associated with the development of Panther. Amortization of this asset began in the first quarter of 2004 when Panther was shipped and is being recognized on a
straight-line basis in accordance with SFAS No. 86 over a 3 year estimated useful life. 


During
the third and fourth quarters of 2002, the Company incurred substantial development costs associated with the development of Mac OS X version 10.2 (code-named "Jaguar") subsequent
to achievement of technological feasibility as evidenced by public demonstration and release of a developer beta in May 2002, and prior to release of the final version of the product in the
fourth quarter of 2002. As such, the Company capitalized approximately $13.3 million of development costs associated with development of Jaguar. Amortization of this asset began in the fourth
quarter of 2002 when Jaguar was shipped and is being recognized on a straight-line basis in accordance with SFAS No. 86 over a 3 year estimated useful life. In addition,
during 2002, the Company also began capitalizing certain costs related to development of its new PowerSchool enterprise student information system. Capitalization of approximately $6 million
began upon achievement of technological feasibility in the first quarter of 2002. The final version of the enterprise student information system was released in July 2002. 


During
2001 the Company incurred substantial development costs associated with the development of the original version of Mac OS X, subsequent to release of a public beta version of the product and
prior to release of the final product version. As a result, the Company capitalized approximately $5.4 million of development costs during 2001 associated with development of Mac OS X. Related
amortization is 


65






 




computed
by use of the straight-line method in accordance with SFAS No. 86 over a 8 year estimated useful life. 


Total
amortization related to capitalized software development costs was $5.8 million, $1.2 million and $350,000 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. 


Advertising Costs  


Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $193 million, $209 million, and $261 million for 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. 


Restructuring Charges  


In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, 
Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
. SFAS
No. 146 supersedes Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94-3, 
Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs
To Exit an Activity (Including Certain Costs Associated with a Restructuring)
 and requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be
recognized when the liability is incurred, as opposed to when management commits to an exit plan. SFAS No. 146 also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at
fair value. This Statement was effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The provisions of SFAS No. 146 were required to be applied prospectively after
the adoption date to newly initiated exit activities. 


Stock-Based Compensation  


The Company measures compensation expense for its employee stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB)
Opinion No. 25, 
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
 The Company applies the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123, 
 
Accounting for Stock-based
Compensation
, as amended by SFAS No. 148
, Accounting for Stock-based
CompensationTransition and Disclosure
 as if the fair value-based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense. The Company has elected to follow APB
Opinion No. 25 because, as discussed below, the alternative fair value accounting provided for under SFAS No. 123 requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use
in valuing employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares. Under APB Opinion No. 25, when the exercise price of the Company's employee stock options equals the market price of
the underlying stock on the date of the grant, no compensation expense is recognized. 


As
required under SFAS No. 123, the pro forma effects of stock-based compensation on net income and earnings per common share for employee stock options granted and employee stock purchase plan
purchases have been estimated at the date of grant and beginning of the period, respectively, using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair
value of the options and shares is amortized to pro forma net income over the options' vesting period and the shares' plan period. 


The
Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of freely traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option
valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected life of options and the Company's expected stock price volatility. Because the Company's employee stock
options and employee stock purchase plan shares have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially
affect the fair value estimate, in 


66






 


management's
opinion, the existing models do not provide a reliable measure of the fair value of the Company's employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares. 


For
purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options and shares is amortized to pro forma net income (loss) over the options' vesting period and the shares' plan period. The
Company's pro forma information for each of the last three fiscal years follows (in millions, except per share amounts):

Earnings Per Common Share  


Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period
increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of common stock had been issued. The dilutive effect of
outstanding options and restricted stock is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential shares of common stock related to stock options were
excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per common share for fiscal 2001 because their effect would have been antidilutive.

Options
to purchase 50.8 million and 58.0 million shares of common stock were outstanding at the end of 2003 and 2002, respectively, that were not included in the computation of diluted
earnings per share for that year because the options' exercise price was greater than the average market price of the Company's common shares for that year and, therefore, the effect would be
antidilutive. At September 29, 2001, the Company had options to purchase 97.2 million shares of its common stock outstanding, all of which were excluded from the computation of diluted
loss per share for 2001 because the effect would have been antidilutive. 


Comprehensive Income  


Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under
generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders' equity but are excluded from net income. The Company's other comprehensive income is comprised of foreign currency
translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as
available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges. 


Segment Information  


The Company reports segment information based on the "management" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions
and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments. Information about the Company's products, major customers, and geographic areas on a company-wide basis is
also disclosed.

The
Company's short-term investment portfolio consists of investments in U.S. Treasury and Agency securities, U.S. corporate securities, and foreign securities. The Company's U.S.
corporate securities consist primarily of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, time deposits and corporate debt securities. Foreign securities consist primarily of foreign commercial paper,
certificates of deposit and time deposits with foreign institutions, most of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company had net unrealized losses totaling $1 million on its investment
portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities greater than 1 year as of September 27, 2003 and net unrealized gains of $20 million on its investment
portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities greater than 1 year, as of September 28, 2002. The Company occasionally sells short-term investments prior
to their stated maturities. As a result of such sales, the Company recognized net gains of $21 million in 2003 and $7 million in 2002. These net gains were included in interest and other
income, net. 


As
of September 27, 2003, approximately $629 million of the Company's short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remaining
short-term investments as of September 27, 2003 had maturities of 3 to 12 months. As of September 28, 2002, approximately $1.087 billion of the Company's
short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remaining short-term investments as of September 28, 2002 had maturities of 3 to
12 months. 


Accounts Receivable  


Trade Receivables  


The Company distributes its products through third-party resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and commercial customers. The Company generally does not require
collateral from its customers. However, when possible the Company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe and Asia
and by arranging with third- 


69






 


party
financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the Company's direct customers. These credit financing arrangements are directly between the third-party
financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables that are
not covered by collateral, third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Company's distribution and retail channel partners. Trade receivables from a single customer,
Ingram Micro, Inc., accounted for approximately 10.3% and 10.8% of net accounts receivable as of September 27, 2003, and September 28, 2002, respectively.

Non-Trade Receivables  


The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors
who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these raw material components directly from suppliers. These non-trade
receivables, which are included in the consolidated balance sheets in other current assets, totaled $184 million and $142 million as of September 27, 2003, and
September 28, 2002, respectively. The Company does not recognize any profits on these sales or reflect the sale of these components in its net sales. 


Inventory Prepayment  


In April 2002, the Company made a $100 million prepayment to an Asian supplier for the purchase of components over the following nine months. In return for this
deposit, the supplier agreed to supply the Company with a specified level of components during the three consecutive fiscal quarters ended December 28, 2002. Approximately $53 million of
this deposit remained unused as of September 28, 2002 and was reflected in the consolidated balance sheets in other current assets. During the first six months of 2003, the remainder of the
deposit balance was fully utilized for the purchase of components. The deposit was unsecured and had no stated interest component. The Company imputed an amount to cost of sales and interest income
during each period the deposit was outstanding at a 3.25% interest rate to reflect the economics of this transaction. 


Derivative Financial Instruments  


The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. Foreign currency forward and option contracts are used to
offset the foreign exchange risk on certain existing assets and liabilities and to hedge the foreign exchange risk on expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenues and cost of sales. From
time to time, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate profile of certain investments and debt. The Company's 


70






 


accounting
policies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at

The
notional principal amounts for derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of year-end, and do not represent the amount of the Company's
exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amount shown in the table above represents the Company's gross exposure to potential accounting loss on these transactions if all counterparties
failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency exchange rates at each respective date. The Company's exposure to credit loss and market risk will
vary over time as a function of currency exchange rates. 


The
estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models using prevailing financial market information as of September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002. In
certain instances where judgment is required in estimating fair value, price quotes were obtained from several of the Company's counterparty financial institutions. Although the table above reflects
the notional principal, fair value, and credit risk amounts of the Company's foreign exchange instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that
the foreign exchange instruments
are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market
conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. 


Foreign Exchange Risk Management  


The Company enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions primarily to protect against foreign exchange risk associated with existing
assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions and certain probable but not firmly committed transactions. Generally, the Company's practice is to hedge a majority of its existing
material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular
exposures, or limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments. 


71






 


In
accordance with SFAS No. 133, hedges related to probable but not firmly committed transactions of an anticipatory nature are designated and documented at hedge inception as cash flow hedges
and evaluated for hedge effectiveness quarterly. For currency forward contracts, hedge effectiveness is measured based on changes in the total fair value of the contract attributable to changes in the
forward exchange rate. Changes in the expected future cash flows on the forecasted hedged transaction and changes in the fair value of the forward hedge are both measured from the contract rate to the
forward exchange rate associated with the forward contract's maturity date. 


For
currency option contracts, hedge effectiveness is measured based on changes in the total fair value of the option contract. Hedge effectiveness is assessed by comparing the present value of the
cumulative change in expected future cash flows on the hedged transaction to changes in expected cash flow of the option hedge at maturity. The net gains or losses on derivative instruments qualifying
as cash flow hedges are reported as components of other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction
affects earnings. Any hedge ineffectiveness is recognized in current earnings in other income and expense. 


To
protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company's U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenues, and the
Company's non-U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries selling in local currencies hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries' functional currency.
Other comprehensive income associated with hedges of foreign currency revenues is recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related sales are recognized, and other comprehensive
income related to inventory purchases is recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Typically, the Company hedges portions of its forecasted
foreign currency exposure associated with revenues and inventory purchases over a time horizon of 3 to 9 months. 


The
Company also enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain recorded assets and
liabilities in non-functional currencies. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in current earnings in other income and expense as offsets to the changes in the
fair value of the related assets or liabilities. 


The
Company may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to offset the translation and economic exposure of a net investment position in a foreign subsidiary. Hedge effectiveness on forwards
designated as net investment hedges is measured based on changes in the fair value of the contract attributable to changes in the spot exchange rate. The effective portion of the net gain or loss on a
derivative instrument designated as a hedge of the net investment position in a foreign subsidiary is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. Any residual changes in
fair value of the forward contract, including changes in fair value based on the differential between the spot and forward exchange rates, are recognized in current earnings in other income and
expense. 


As
discussed above, the Company enters into foreign currency option contracts as items that provide an offset to the re-measurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities denominated
in non-functional currencies. All changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts based on changes in option time value are recorded in current earnings in other income and
expense. Due to market movements, changes in option time value can lead to increased volatility in other income and expense. 


Derivative
instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable that the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified
time period or within a subsequent 2 month time period. Deferred gains and losses in other comprehensive income associated with 


72






 




such
derivative instruments are immediately reclassified into earnings in other income and expense. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are also reflected in current
earnings unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. During 2002, the Company recorded net gains of $2.5 million in other income and expense related to the loss
of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges due to changes in the Company's forecast of future net sales and cost of sales and due to prevailing market conditions. During 2001, the Company
recorded a net gain of $5.1 million in other income and expense related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges due to changes in the Company's forecast of future net
sales and cost of sales. No net gains, or losses, of a similar nature were recorded in 2003. 


Interest Rate Risk Management  


The Company sometimes enters into interest rate derivative transactions, including interest rate swaps, collars, and floors, with financial institutions in order to better
match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on its
long-term debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the Company's exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. 


As
of September 30, 2000, the Company had entered into interest rate swaps with financial institutions in order to better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its
cash equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on its long-term debt, and to diversify a portion of the Company's exposure away
from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. The interest rate swaps generally required the Company to pay a floating interest rate based on the three- or six-month
U.S. dollar LIBOR and receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of the underlying notional amounts. These swaps effectively converted the Company's fixed-rate 10-year
debt to floating-rate debt and converted a portion of the floating rate investments to fixed rate. The Company assumed no ineffectiveness with regard to the debt interest swaps as each
debt interest rate swap met the criteria for accounting under the short-cut method defined in SFAS No. 133 for fair value hedges of debt instruments. Accordingly, no net gains or
losses were recorded in income relative to the Company's underlying debt interest rate swaps. During fiscal 2001, the Company closed out all of its existing debt interest rate swap positions due to
prevailing market interest rates realizing a gain of $17 million. This gain was deferred, recognized in long-term debt and is being amortized to other income and expense over the
remaining life of the debt. 


The
unrealized loss on the asset swaps as of September 30, 2000, of $5.7 million was deferred and then recognized in income in 2001 as part of the SFAS No. 133 transition
adjustment effective on October 1, 2000. The Company closed out all of its existing interest rate asset swaps during 2001 realizing a gain of $1.1 million. 


As
of September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002, the Company had no interest rate derivatives outstanding. Due to perceived market risk, the Company entered into interest rate swaps in
early 2002. The interest rate swaps required the Company to pay a floating interest rate based on six-month U.S. dollar LIBOR and receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of the
underlying notional amounts. These swaps effectively converted the Company's fixed-rate 10-year debt to floating-rate debt. The Company assumed no ineffectiveness
with regard to the debt interest swaps as each debt interest rate swap met the criteria for accounting under the short-cut method defined in SFAS No. 133 for fair value hedges of
debt instruments. Accordingly, no net gains or losses were recorded in income relative to the Company's underlying debt interest rate swaps during fiscal 2002 until the Company closed out the
positions in late 2002 due to prevailing market interest rates. Closing the debt interest rate swaps resulted in a realized gain 


73






 




of
$6 million. This gain was deferred, recognized in long-term debt and is being amortized to other income and expense over the remaining life of the debt. 


Debt  


The Company currently has debt outstanding in the form of $300 million of aggregate principal amount 6.5% unsecured notes that were originally issued in 1994. The notes,
which pay interest semiannually, were sold at 99.925% of par, for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. The notes, along with approximately $4 million of related unamortized deferred gains
on closed interest rate swaps, are due in February of 2004 and therefore have been classified as current debt as of September 27, 2003. As of September 27, 2003 and September 28,
2002, the carrying amount of these notes, including unamortized deferred gains associated with closed debt interest rate swaps, was $304 million and $316 million, respectively, while the
fair value was $302 million and $299 million, respectively. The fair value of the notes is based on their listed market values as of September 27, 2003 and September 28,
2002. 


Non-Current Debt and Equity Investments and Related Gains and Losses  


The Company has held investments in EarthLink, Inc. (EarthLink), Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai), ARM Holdings plc (ARM), and Samsung Electronics
Co., Ltd (Samsung). These investments have been reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as long term assets within other assets and have been categorized as
available-for-sale requiring that they be carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in equity as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income. All realized gains on the sale of these investments have been included in total other income and expense. The combined fair value of these investments held by the Company was
$5 million and $39 million as of September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002, respectively. 


EarthLink  


In January 2000, the Company invested $200 million in EarthLink, an Internet service provider (ISP). The investment was in EarthLink's Series C Convertible
Preferred Stock, which was convertible by the Company after January 4, 2001, into approximately 7.1 million shares of EarthLink common stock. Concurrent with this investment, EarthLink
and the Company entered into a multi-year agreement to deliver ISP service to Macintosh users in the United States. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company profits from each new Mac
customer that subscribes to EarthLink's ISP service for a specified period of time, and EarthLink is the default ISP in the Company's Internet Setup Software included with all Macintosh computers sold
in the United States. 


During
the first quarter of 2003, the Company sold 2,580,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds of approximately $13.7 million, an amount that approximated the Company's carrying value
of the shares. During the third quarter of 2003, the Company sold all of its remaining holdings in EarthLink, consisting of 3,960,000 shares of stock for net proceeds of approximately
$23 million, and a gain before taxes of $2 million. 


During
the first quarter of 2002, the Company sold 117,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds of $2 million and a gain before taxes of $223,000. No sales of EarthLink were made in any
of the subsequent quarters of fiscal 2002. However, during the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company determined that the then current decline in the fair value of its investment in EarthLink was
other-than-temporary. As a result, the Company recognized a $44 million charge to earnings to write-down the basis of its investment in EarthLink to
$35 million. This charge was included in gains (losses) on non-current investments, net. As of September 28, 2002, the Company held 6.5 million shares of EarthLink
stock valued at $35 million. 


74






 




During
the second quarter of 2001, the Company determined that the decline in the fair value of its investment in EarthLink was other-than-temporary requiring that its cost
basis be written down to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write-down be included in earnings. As a result, the Company recognized a $114 million charge to
earnings to write-down the basis of its investment in EarthLink to $86 million. This charge was included in gains (losses) on non-current investments, net. During the
fourth quarter of 2001, the Company sold a total of approximately 425,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds of approximately $6 million, recorded a gain before taxes of approximately
$800,000, and recognized related income tax of approximately $200,000. 


Akamai  


In June 1999, the Company invested $12.5 million in Akamai, a global Internet content delivery service. The investment was in the form of convertible preferred
stock that converted into 4.1 million shares of Akamai common stock (adjusted for subsequent stock splits) at the time of Akamai's initial public
offering in October 1999. Beginning in the first quarter of 2000, the Company categorized its shares in Akamai as available-for-sale. 


During
the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company sold 1,875,000 shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of $9 million and a gain before taxes of $8 million. As of September 27,
2003, the Company's remaining investment in Akamai consists of 986,000 shares of Akamai stock valued at $5 million. 


During
the first quarter of 2002, the Company sold 250,000 shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of $2 million and a gain before taxes of $710,000. No sales of Akamai were made in any of the
subsequent quarters of fiscal 2002. However, during the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company determined that the decline in the fair value of its investment in Akamai was
other-than-temporary. As a result, the Company recognized a $6 million charge to earnings to write-down the basis of its investment in Akamai to
$3 million. This charge was included in gains (losses) on non-current investments, net. As of September 28, 2002, the Company held 2.9 million shares of Akamai stock
valued at $3 million. 


During
2001, the Company sold a total of approximately 1 million shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of approximately $39 million and recorded a gain before taxes of approximately
$36 million. 


ARM  


ARM is a publicly held company in the United Kingdom involved in the design and licensing of high performance microprocessors and related technology. 


During
the third quarter of 2003, the Company sold all of its remaining holdings in ARM stock, consisting of 278,000 shares for net proceeds of approximately $295,000, and a gain before taxes of
$270,000. 


During
the first quarter of 2002, the Company sold 4.7 million shares of ARM stock for both net proceeds and a gain before taxes of $21 million. No sales of ARM were made in any of the
subsequent quarters of fiscal 2002. As of September 28, 2002, the Company held 278,000 shares of ARM stock valued at $578,000. 


During
2001, the Company sold a total of approximately 29.8 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of approximately $176 million, recorded a gain before taxes of approximately
$174 million, and recognized related income tax expense of approximately $52 million. 


75










 
 


Samsung  


During the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company invested $100 million in Samsung to assist in the further expansion of Samsung's TFT-LCD
flat-panel display production capacity. The investment was in the form of three year unsecured bonds, which were convertible into approximately 550,000 shares of Samsung common stock
beginning in July 2000. The bonds carried an annual coupon rate of 2% and paid a total yield to maturity of 5% if redeemed at maturity. 


Prior
to its sale, the Company had categorized its investment in Samsung as available-for-sale requiring that it be carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net
of taxes, reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The fair value of the Company's investment in Samsung was approximately $123 million as of
September 30, 2000. With the adoption of SFAS No. 133 on October 1, 2000, the Company was required to account for the conversion option embedded in the Samsung bonds separately
from the related debt. The conversion feature was carried at fair value with any changes in fair value recognized in earnings in the period in which they occur. Included in the $17 million
gross SFAS No. 133 transition adjustment recorded in earnings during the first quarter of fiscal 2001 was a $23 million favorable adjustment for the restatement to fair value as of
October 1, 2000, of the derivative component of the Company's investment in Samsung. To adjust the carrying value of the derivative component of its investment in Samsung to fair value as of
December 30, 2000, the Company recognized an unrealized loss of approximately $13 million during the first quarter of 2001. During the second quarter of 2001, the Company sold this
investment for book value, including accrued interest, and received net proceeds of approximately $117 million. 


Other Strategic Investments  


The Company has made additional minority debt and equity investments in several privately held technology companies, which were reflected in the consolidated balance sheets in
other assets. These investments were inherently risky because the products and/or markets of these companies were typically not fully developed. During 2002 and 2001, the Company determined that the
decline in fair value of certain of these investments was other-than-temporary and, accordingly, recognized a charge to earnings of $15 million and $8 million,
respectively. These charges
were included in gains (losses) on non-current investments, net. As of September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002, the Company had no private debt or equity investments
reflected in its consolidated balance sheets.

Acquisition of Emagic GmbH  


During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company acquired Emagic GmbH (Emagic), a provider of professional software solutions for computer based music production, for
approximately $30 million in cash; $26 million of which was paid immediately upon closing of the deal and $4 million of which was held-back for future payment
contingent on continued employment by certain employees that will be allocated to future compensation expense in the appropriate periods over the next 3 years. During fiscal 2003, contingent
consideration totaling $1.3 million was paid. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase. The portion of the purchase price allocated to purchased in-process research and
development (IPR&D) was expensed immediately, and the portion of the purchase price allocated to acquired technology and to tradename will be amortized over their estimated useful lives of
3 years. Goodwill associated with the acquisition of Emagic is not subject to amortization pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 142. Total consideration was allocated as follows (in
millions):

amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition, because the technological feasibility of products under development had not been established and no alternative
future uses existed. The IPR&D relates primarily to Emagic's Logic series technology and extensions. At the date of the acquisition, the products under development were between 43%-83%
complete, and it was expected that the remaining work would be completed during the Company's fiscal 2003 at a cost of approximately $415,000. The remaining efforts, which were completed in 2003,
included finalizing user interface design and development, and testing. The fair value of the IPR&D was determined using an income approach, which reflects the projected free cash flows that will be
generated by the IPR&D projects and that are attributable to the acquired technology, and discounting the projected net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 25%. 


Acquisition of certain assets of Zayante, Inc., Prismo Graphics, and Silicon Grail  


During fiscal 2002 the Company acquired certain technology and patent rights of Zayante, Inc., Prismo Graphics, and Silicon Grail Corporation for a total of
$20 million in cash. These transactions have been accounted for as asset acquisitions. The purchase price for these asset acquisitions, except for $1 million identified as contingent
consideration which will be allocated to compensation expense over the next 3 years, has been allocated to acquired technology and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over
3 years, except for certain assets acquired from Zayante associated with patent royalty streams that will be amortized over 10 years. 


Acquisition of Nothing Real, LLC  


During the second quarter of 2002, the Company acquired certain assets of Nothing Real, LLC (Nothing Real), a privately-held company that develops and markets high
performance tools designed for the digital image creation market. Of the $15 million purchase price, the Company has allocated $7 million to acquired technology, which will be amortized
over its estimated life of 5 years. The remaining $8 million, which has been identified as contingent consideration, rather than recorded as an additional component of the cost of the
acquired assets, will be allocated to future compensation expense in the appropriate periods over the next 3 years. 


Acquisition of Spruce Technologies, Inc.  


In July 2001, the Company acquired Spruce Technologies, Inc. (Spruce), a privately-held company that develops and markets DVD authoring products, for
$14.9 million in cash. Goodwill associated with the acquisition of Spruce is not subject to amortization pursuant to the transition provisions of SFAS No. 142. The consolidated financial
statements include the operating results of Spruce from the date of acquisition. Total consideration was allocated as follows (in millions):

Acquisition of PowerSchool, Inc.  


In May 2001, the Company acquired PowerSchool, Inc. (PowerSchool), a provider of web-based student information systems for K-12 schools
and districts that enable schools to record, access, report, and manage their student data and performance in real-time, and gives parents real-time web access to track 


80






 


their
children's progress. The consolidated financial statements include the operating results of PowerSchool from the date of acquisition. 


The
purchase price of approximately $66.1 million consisted of the issuance of approximately 2.4 million shares of the Company's common stock with a fair value of $61.2 million,
the issuance of stock options with a fair value of $4.5 million, and $300,000 of direct transaction costs. The fair value of the common stock options issued was determined using a Black-Scholes
option pricing model with the following assumptions: volatility of 67%, expected life of 4 years, dividend rate of 0%, and risk-free rate of 4.73%.

The
amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition, because the technological feasibility of products under development had not been established and no alternative
future uses existed. The IPR&D relates to technologies representing processes and expertise employed to design, develop, and deploy a functioning, scalable web-based student information
system for use by K-12 schools. At the date of the acquisition, the product under development was approximately 50% complete, and it was expected that the remaining 50% would be completed
during the Company's fiscal 2002 at a cost of approximately $9.25 million. The remaining efforts, which were completed in 2002, included completion of coding, finalizing user interface design
and development, and testing. The fair value of the IPR&D was determined using an income approach, which reflects the projected free cash flows that will be generated by the IPR&D projects and that
are attributable to the acquired technology, and discounting the projected net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 25%. The acquired intangibles are being amortized over
their estimated useful lives of 3 years. Deferred stock compensation associated with restricted stock and options is being amortized over the required future vesting period of 3 years. 


In
the fourth quarter of 2001, an adjustment was made to increase goodwill associated with the acquisition of PowerSchool by $5.9 million due to the identification of previously unidentified
loss contingencies that were in existence prior to consummation of the acquisition. 


The
Company allocated $12.8 million of its purchase consideration for PowerSchool to deferred stock compensation within shareholders' equity. This amount represented the intrinsic value of
stock options assumed that vest as future services are provided by employees and related to 445,000 common shares issued contingent on continued employment of certain PowerSchool employee
stockholders. Certain PowerSchool employee stockholders were terminated in the first quarter of 2003 resulting in the $5 million recognition of previously deferred stock compensation as part of
the Company's first quarter restructuring action. Unamortized PowerSchool related deferred stock compensation of approximately $294,000 remains as of September 27, 2003.

Note 5Restructuring Charges  


Fiscal 2003 Restructuring Actions  


The Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $26.8 million during the year ended September 27, 2003, including approximately
$7.4 million in severance costs, a $5.0 million charge to write-off deferred compensation, $7.1 million in asset impairments and a $7.3 million
charge for lease cancellations. Of the $26.8 million, nearly all had been spent by the end of 2003, except for approximately $400,000 of severance costs and approximately $4.5 million
related to operating lease costs on abandoned facilities. During the third quarter of 2003, approximately $500,000 of the amount originally accrued for lease cancellations was determined to be in
excess due to the sublease of a property sooner than originally estimated and an approximately $500,000 shortfall was identified in the severance accrual due to higher than expected severance costs
related to the closure of the Company's Singapore manufacturing operations. These adjustments had no net effect on reported operating expense. 


During
the second quarter of 2003, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions that resulted in recognition of a total restructuring charge of $2.8 million, including
$2.4 million in severance costs and $400,000 for asset write-offs and lease payments on an abandoned facility. Actions taken in the second quarter were for the most part
supplemental to actions initiated in the prior two quarters and focused on further headcount reductions in various sales and marketing functions in the Company's Americas and Europe operating segments
and further reductions associated with PowerSchool-related activities in the Americas operating segment, including an accrual for asset write-offs and lease payments on an abandoned
facility. The second quarter actions resulted in the termination of 93 employees, 92 were terminated prior to the end of 2003. 


During
the first quarter of 2003, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of $24 million that resulted in the termination of manufacturing
operations at the Company-owned facility in Singapore, further reductions in headcount resulting from the shift in PowerSchool product strategy that took place at the end of fiscal 2002, and
termination of various sales and marketing activities in the United States and Europe. These restructuring actions will ultimately result in the elimination of 260 positions worldwide, all but one of
which were eliminated by the end of 2003. 


Closure
of the Company's Singapore manufacturing operations resulted in severance costs of $1.8 million and costs of $6.7 million to write-off manufacturing related fixed
assets, whose use ceased during the first quarter. PowerSchool related costs included severance of approximately $550,000 and recognition of $5 million of previously deferred stock compensation
that arose when PowerSchool was acquired by the 


82






 




Company
in 2001 related to certain PowerSchool employee stockholders who were terminated in the first quarter of 2003. Termination of sales and marketing activities and employees, principally in the
United States and Europe, resulted in severance costs of $2.8 million and accrual of costs associated with operating leases on closed facilities of $6.7 million. The total net
restructuring charge of $23 million recognized during the first quarter of 2003 also reflects the reversal of $600,000 of unused restructuring accrual originally made during the first quarter
of 2002. 


Except
for certain costs associated with operating leases on closed facilities, the Company currently anticipates that all of the remaining accrual for severance costs of approximately $400,000 will
be spent by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2004.

Fiscal 2002 Restructuring Actions  


During fiscal 2002, the Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $30 million related to actions intended to eliminate certain activities and better
align the Company's operating expenses with existing general economic conditions and to partially offset the cost of continuing investments in new product development and investments in the Company's
Retail operating segment. 


During
the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of approximately $6 million designed to reduce headcount costs in
corporate operations and sales and to adjust its PowerSchool product strategy. These restructuring actions resulted in the elimination of approximately 180 positions worldwide at a cost of
$1.8 million, all of which were eliminated by September 27, 2003. Eliminated positions were primarily in corporate operations, sales, and PowerSchool related research and development in
the Americas operating segment. The shift in product strategy at PowerSchool included discontinuing development and marketing of PowerSchool's PSE product. This shift resulted in the impairment of
previously capitalized development costs associated with the PSE product in the amount of $4.5 million. 


During
the first quarter of 2002, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of approximately $24 million. These restructuring actions resulted in
the elimination of approximately 425 positions worldwide at a cost of $8 million. Positions were eliminated primarily in the Company's operations, information systems, and administrative
functions. In addition, these restructuring actions also included significant changes in the Company's information systems strategy resulting in termination of equipment leases and cancellation of
existing projects and activities. The Company ceased using the assets associated with first quarter 2002 restructuring actions during that same quarter. Related lease and contract cancellation charges
totaled $12 million, and charges for asset impairments totaled 


83






 




$4 million.
The first quarter 2002 restructuring actions were primarily related to corporate activity not allocated to operating segments. During the first quarter of 2003, the Company reversed
the remaining unused accrual of $600,000.

The
foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pretax earnings of approximately $250 million, $284 million and $363 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. As
of September 27, 2003, approximately $2.5 billion of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based
in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries would be subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the United States. The Company's consolidated financial statements
fully provide for any related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated, aside from undistributed earnings of certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be indefinitely
reinvested in operations outside the United States. U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $822 million of such earnings. It is not practicable to determine the
income tax liability that might be incurred if these earnings were to be distributed. 


Deferred
tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits, and the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts
of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected
to be recovered or settled. 


As
of September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002, the significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in millions):

As
of September 27, 2003, the Company had operating loss carryforwards for federal tax purposes of approximately $189 million, which expire from 2011 through 2023. A portion of these
carryforwards was acquired from NeXT and other acquisitions, the utilization of which is subject to certain limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The Company also has Federal credit
carryforwards and various state and foreign tax loss and credit carryforwards, the tax effect of which is approximately $117 million and which expire between 2004 and 2023. The remaining
benefits from tax losses and credits do not expire. As of September 27, 2003, a valuation allowance of $30 million was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax
losses that may not be realized. The valuation allowance relates primarily to the operating loss carryforwards acquired from NeXT and other acquisitions. Management believes it is more likely than not
that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax 


85






 




planning
strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. 


A
reconciliation of the provision for income taxes, with the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate (35% in 2003, 2002, and 2001) to income (loss) before provision for

On
April 10, 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) completed its audit of the Company's federal income tax returns for the years 1998 through 2000 and proposed certain adjustments. Certain
of these adjustments are being contested through the IRS Appeals Office. Substantially all IRS audit issues for years prior to 1998 have been resolved. Management believes that adequate provision has
been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. Should any issues addressed in the Company's tax audits be
resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs. 


Note 7Shareholders' Equity  


CEO Restricted Stock Award  


On March 19, 2003, the Company entered into an Option Cancellation and Restricted Stock Award Agreement (the Agreement) with Steven P. Jobs, its Chief Executive Officer
(CEO). The Agreement cancelled stock option awards for the purchase of 27.5 million shares of the Company's common stock previously granted to Mr. Jobs in 2000 and 2001. Mr. Jobs
retained options to purchase 60,000 shares of the Company's common stock granted in August of 1997 in his capacity as a member of the Company's Board of Directors, prior to becoming the Company's CEO.
The Agreement replaced the cancelled options with a restricted stock award of 5 million shares of the Company's common stock. The restricted stock award generally vests three years from date of
grant. Vesting of some or all of the restricted shares will be accelerated in the event Mr. Jobs is terminated without cause, dies, or has his management role reduced following a change in
control of the Company. 


The
Company has recorded the value of the restricted stock award of $74.75 million as a component of shareholders' equity and is amortizing that amount on a straight-line basis over
the 3-year service/vesting period. The value of the restricted stock award was based on the closing market price of the Company's 


86






 




common
stock on the date of the award. Total amortization of approximately $13 million has been included in selling, general, and administrative expense in 2003 and will continue to be included
at approximately $6.2 million per quarter through March 2006. The 5 million restricted shares have been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share utilizing the
treasury stock method. 


Stock Repurchase Plan  


In July 1999, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does
not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time. 


During
the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company entered into a forward purchase agreement to acquire 1.5 million shares of its common stock in September of 2003 at an average price of $16.64 per
share for a total cost of $25.5 million. In August 2003, the Company settled this agreement prior to its maturity, at which time the Company's common stock had a fair value of $22.81.
Other than this forward purchase transaction, the Company has not engaged in any transactions to repurchase its common stock since fiscal 2000. Since inception of the stock repurchase plan, the
Company had repurchased a total of 6.55 million shares at a cost of $217 million. The Company was authorized to repurchase up to an additional $283 million of its common stock as
of September 27, 2003. 


Preferred Stock  


In August 1997, the Company and Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft) entered into patent cross license and technology agreements. In addition, Microsoft purchased 150,000
shares of Apple Series A nonvoting convertible preferred stock ("preferred stock") for $150 million. These shares were convertible by Microsoft after August 5, 2000, into shares
of the Company's common stock at a conversion price of $8.25 per share. During 2000, 74,250 shares of preferred stock were converted to 9 million shares of the Company's common stock. During
2001, the remaining 75,750 preferred shares were converted into 9.2 million shares of the Company's common stock. 


Comprehensive Income  


Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under
generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders' equity but are excluded from net income. The Company's other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency
translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as
available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges.

Note 8Employee Benefit Plans  


2003 Employee Stock Option Plan  


At the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on April 24, 2003, the shareholders approved an amendment to the 1998 Executive Officer Stock Plan to change the name of the
plan to the 2003 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 2003 Plan), to provide for broad-based grants to all employees in addition to executive officers and other key employees and to prohibit future
"repricings" of employee stock options, including
6-months-plus-1-day option exchange programs, without shareholder approval. Based on the terms of individual option grants, options granted under the
2003 Plan generally expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment, with either annual or quarterly
vesting. The 2003 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, and stock purchase rights. 


1997 Employee Stock Option Plan  


In August 1997, the Company's Board of Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 1997 Plan), a non-shareholder approved plan for grants of
stock options to employees who are not officers of the Company. Options may be granted under the 1997 Plan to employees at not less than the fair market value on the date of grant. Based on the terms
of individual option grants, options granted under the 1997 


88






 


Plan
generally expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment, with either annual or quarterly
vesting. As a result of shareholder approval of amendments to the 1998 Executive Officer Stock Plan in April 2003, the Company terminated the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan and cancelled all
remaining unissued shares, following the completion of an employee stock option exchange program in October 2003. 


Employee Stock Option Exchange Program  


On March 20, 2003, the Company announced a voluntary employee stock option exchange program (the Exchange Program) whereby eligible employees, other than executive
officers and members of the Board of Directors, had an opportunity to exchange outstanding options with exercise prices at or above $25.00 per share for a predetermined smaller number of new stock
options issued with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of one share of the Company's common stock on the day the new awards are issued, which would be at least six months plus one day
after the exchange options are cancelled. On April 17, 2003, in accordance with the Exchange Program, the Company accepted and cancelled options to purchase 16,569,193 shares of its common
stock. On October 22, 2003, new stock options totaling 6,697,368 shares were issued to employees at an exercise price of $22.76 per share, which is equivalent to the closing price of the
Company's stock on that date. No financial or accounting impact to the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flow was associated with this transaction. 


1997 Director Stock Option Plan  


In August 1997, the Company's Board of Directors adopted a shareholder approved Director Stock Option Plan (DSOP) for non-employee directors of the Company.
Initial grants of 30,000 options under the DSOP vest in three equal installments on each of the first through third
anniversaries of the date of grant, and subsequent annual grants of 10,000 options are fully vested at grant. 


Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans  


Certain of the Company's executive officers, including Mr. Timothy D. Cook and Mr. Fred D. Anderson, have entered into trading plans pursuant to
Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. A trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula
for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of Apple stock including the exercise and sale of employee stock options and shares acquired pursuant to the Company's
Employee Stock Purchase Plan. 


Employee Stock Purchase Plan  


The Company has a shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan (the Purchase Plan), under which substantially all employees may purchase common stock through payroll
deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values as of the beginning and end of six-month offering periods. Stock purchases under the Purchase Plan are limited to
10% of an employee's compensation, up to a maximum of $25,000 in any calendar year. In the third quarter of 2003, the Company's shareholders also approved an amendment to the Employee Stock Purchase
Plan to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance by 4 million shares. Beginning with the six-month offering period that started on June 30, 2003, the number of
shares authorized for issuance is limited to a total of 1 million shares per offering period. During 2003, 2002, and 2001, 2.1 million, 1.8 million and 1.8 million shares,
respectively, were issued under the Purchase Plan. As of September 27, 2003, approximately 4.0 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan. 


89






 


Employee Savings Plan  


The Company has an employee savings plan (the Savings Plan) qualifying as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the
Savings Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limit ($12,000 for calendar year 2003). The
Company matches 50% to 100% of each employee's contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employee's earnings. The Company's matching contributions to the Savings Plan
were approximately $21 million, $19 million, and $17 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.

As
of September 28, 2002, the Company had exercisable options to purchase 57.9 million shares outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $30.85 per share. As of
September 29, 2001, the Company had exercisable options to purchase 42.1 million shares outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $32.15. 


Note 9Stock-Based Compensation  


The
Company has provided pro forma disclosures in Note 1 of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the effect on net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share as if the fair
value method of accounting for stock compensation had been used for its employee stock option grants and employee stock purchase plan purchases. These pro forma effects have been estimated at the date
of grant and beginning of the period, respectively, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. 


For
purposes of the pro forma disclosures provided pursuant to SFAS No. 123, the option awards issued in October 2003 and the awards cancelled as part of the Exchange Program have been
accounted for using modification accounting. In accordance with SFAS No. 123, the grant date of the awards issued is the date of acceptance of the exchange offer by participating employees. The
cancellation of certain of the Company's Chief Executive Officer's options and replacement with restricted shares in March 2003 is also being accounted for using modification accounting for
purposes of the pro forma disclosures provided pursuant to SFAS No. 123.

For
purposes of the pro forma disclosures provided pursuant to SFAS No. 123, the expected volatility assumptions used by the Company prior to the third quarter of 2003 have been based solely on
the historical volatility of the Company's common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Company's stock options. Beginning in the third quarter of
2003, the Company has modified this approach to consider other relevant factors including implied volatility in market traded options on the Company's common stock and the impact of unusual
fluctuations not reasonably expected to recur on the historical volatility of the Company's common stock. The Company will continue to monitor these and other relevant factors in developing the
expected volatility assumption used to value future awards. 


Beginning
in the third quarter of 2003, the Company shortened its estimate of the expected life of new options granted to its employees from 4 years to 3.5 years. The Company bases its
expected life assumption on its historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock options it grants to employees. The change in the expected life assumption made during the third
quarter of 2003 was the result of the expected impact of shortening the contractual life of new options granted to employees from 10 years to 7 years and changing the vesting provisions
of new options granted to employees from 4 year straight-line annual vesting to 4 year straight-line quarterly vesting. 


Note 10Commitments and Contingencies  


Lease Commitments  


The Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any other
off-balance-sheet financing arrangements. The major facility leases are for terms of 5 to 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of 3 to 5 additional years. Leases
for retail space are for terms of 5 to 15 years and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of September 27, 2003, the Company's total future minimum lease payments
under noncancelable operating leases were $600 million, of which $354 million related to leases for retail space. 


Rent
expense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $97 million, $92 million, and $80 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.

Accrued Warranty and Indemnifications  


The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period for hardware products is typically one year from the date of
purchase by the end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for Apple software and for Apple service parts used to repair Apple hardware products. The Company
provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product warranties at the time related revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate
accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical warranty claim rates, historical and projected
cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company's typical experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting warranty
liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future expectations.

The
Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property
rights. Other licensing agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an
infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted
against itself or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims that would have a material adverse effect
on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Therefore, the Company did not record a liability for infringement costs as of either September 27, 2003 or September 28,
2002.

Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product  


Although certain components essential to the Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, other key components (including microprocessors and
application-specific integrated circuits, or ("ASICs")) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some other key components, while currently available to the Company from
multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide availability and pricing pressures. In addition, the Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal
computer industry, and new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for and
subsequently qualifies additional suppliers. If the supply of a key single-sourced component to the Company were to be delayed or curtailed or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays shipments
of completed products to the Company, the Company's ability to ship related products in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely affected. The Company's business and financial
performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an
alternative source. Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to
meet the Company's requirements. Finally, significant portions of the Company's CPUs, logic boards, and assembled products are now manufactured by outsourcing partners, the majority of which occurs in
various parts of Asia. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company's operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing
partners were unable to meet their production obligations. 


Contingencies  


Beginning on September 27, 2001, three shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against
the Company and its Chief Executive Officer. These lawsuits are substantially identical, and purport to bring suit on behalf of persons who purchased the Company's publicly traded common stock between
July 19, 2000, and September 28, 2000. The complaints allege violations of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. The Company
believes these claims are without merit and intends to defend them vigorously. The Company filed a motion to dismiss on June 4, 2002, which was heard by the Court on September 13, 2002.
On December 11, 2002, the Court granted the Company's
motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action, with leave to Plaintiffs to amend their complaint within thirty days. Plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on January 31, 2003, and
on March 17, 2003, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The Court heard the Company's motion on July 11, 2003 and dismissed Plaintiff's claims with prejudice on
August 12, 2003. Plaintiffs have appealed the ruling. 


The
Company is subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully adjudicated. In the opinion of management, the Company
does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity
or results of operations. However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these
legal matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. 


Production
and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers 


94






 




the
ability to return product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been
passed in several jurisdictions that the Company operates including various European Union member countries, Japan and California. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse affects
in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's
results of operations and financial position. 


Note 11Segment Information and Geographic Data  


The
Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas segment includes both North
and South America, except for the activities of the Company's Retail segment. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Japan segment includes only
Japan. As of September 27, 2003, the Retail segment currently operates Apple-owned retail stores in the United States. Other operating segments include Asia-Pacific, which includes
Australia and Asia except for Japan, and the Company's subsidiary, Filemaker, Inc. Each reportable operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services, and
the accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1, except as described below for the Retail segment. 


The
Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales. The Retail segment's performance is also evaluated based on operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are
based on the location of the customers. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment.
Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses that are managed outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various
corporate expenses, manufacturing costs not included in standard costs, income taxes, and various nonrecurring charges. Corporate expenses include research and development, corporate marketing
expenses, and other separately managed general and administrative expenses including certain corporate expenses associated with support of the Retail segment. The Company does not include intercompany
transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. Segment assets exclude corporate assets. Corporate assets include cash, short-term and long-term investments,
manufacturing facilities, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets, and retail store construction-in-progress that is not subject
to depreciation. Except for the Retail segment, capital expenditures for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment. Capital expenditures by the Retail segment were
$92 million, $106 million, and $92 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. 


Operating
income for all segments except Retail includes cost of sales at standard cost. Certain manufacturing expenses and related adjustments not included in segment cost of sales, including
variances between standard and actual manufacturing costs and the mark-up above standard cost for product supplied to the Retail segment, are included in corporate expenses. 


To
assess the operating performance of the Retail segment several significant items are included in its results for internal management reporting that are not included in results of the Company's
other segments. First, cost of sales for the Retail segment includes a mark-up above the Company's standard cost to approximate the price normally charged to the Company's major channel
partners in the United States. For the years ended September 27, 2003, September 28, 2002, and September 29, 2001 this resulted in the 


95






 




recognition
of additional cost of sales above standard cost by the Retail segment and an offsetting benefit to corporate expenses of approximately $106 million, $52 million, and
$4 million, respectively. 


Second,
the Retail segment includes in its net sales proceeds from sales of the Company's extended warranty and support contracts and also recognizes related cost of sales based on the amount at which
such contracts are normally sold to the Company's resellers operating retail stores in the United States. This treatment is consistent with how the Company's major resellers account for the sales and
cost of the Company's extended warranty and support contracts. Because the Company has not yet earned the revenue or incurred the costs associated with the sale of these contracts, an offset to these
amounts is recognized in the Americas segment's net sales and cost of sales. For the year ended September 27, 2003, this resulted in the recognition of net sales and cost of sales by the Retail
segment, with
corresponding offsets in the Americas segment, of $30 million and $20 million, respectively. For the year ended September 28, 2002, this resulted in the recognition of net sales
and cost of sales by the Retail segment, with corresponding offsets in the Americas segment, of $8 million and $6 million, respectively. These amounts were insignificant in fiscal 2001. 


Third,
a portion of the operating expenses associated with certain high profile retail stores are allocated from the Retail segment to corporate marketing expense. Allocation of these expenses
reflects the unique nature of these stores which, given their larger size and extraordinary design elements, function as vehicles for general corporate marketing, corporate sales and marketing events,
and brand awareness. Allocated operating costs are those in excess of operating costs incurred by one of the Company's more typical retail locations. Stores were open in three such high profile
locations in New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago as of September 27, 2003. Expenses allocated to corporate marketing resulting from the operations of these three stores were $6 million
and $1 million in fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively.

A
large portion of the Company's net sales is derived from its international operations. Also, a majority of the raw materials used in the Company's products is obtained from sources outside of the
United States, and a majority of the products sold by the Company is assembled internationally in the Company's facility in Cork, Ireland or by third-party vendors in Taiwan, Korea, the Netherlands,
the People's Republic of China, and the Czech Republic. As a result, the Company is subject to risks associated with foreign operations, such as obtaining governmental permits and approvals, currency
exchange fluctuations, currency restrictions, political instability, labor problems, trade restrictions, and changes in tariff and freight charges. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of
net sales in 2003, 2002 or 2001.

Note 12Related Party Transactions and Certain Other Transactions  


During
the first quarter of 2000, the Company's Board of Directors approved a special executive bonus for the Company's Chief Executive Officer for past services in the form of an aircraft with a
total cost to the Company of approximately $90 million, the majority of which was not tax deductible. Approximately half of the total charge was for the cost of the aircraft. The other half
represented all other costs and taxes associated with the bonus. In the fourth quarter of 2002, all significant work and payments associated with the aircraft were completed. Of the original
$90 million accrual, $2.4 million remained unspent at the end of fiscal 2002 and was reversed. 


In
March 2002, the Company entered into a Reimbursement Agreement with its Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Steven P. Jobs, for the reimbursement of expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs in
the operation of his private plane when used for Apple business. The Reimbursement Agreement is effective for expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs for Apple business purposes since he took delivery of
the plane in May 2001. The Company recognized a total of $404,000 in expenses pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement during fiscal 2003. For fiscal 2002, the Company recognized a total of
$1,168,000 in expenses pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement related to expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs during 2001 and 2002. All expenses recognized pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement
have been included by the Company in selling, general, and administrative expenses. 


In
connection with a relocation assistance package, the Company loaned Mr. Ronald B. Johnson, Senior Vice President, Retail, $1.5 million for the purchase of his principal residence. The
loan is secured by a deed of trust and is due and payable in May 2004. Under the terms of the loan, Mr. Johnson agreed that should he exercise any of his stock options prior to the due
date of the loan, he would pay the Company an amount equal to the lesser of (1) an amount equal to 50% of the total net gain realized from the exercise 


99






 




of
the options; or (2) $375,000 multiplied by the number of years between the exercise date and the date of the loan. Mr. Johnson repaid $750,000 of this loan in fiscal 2003. The
remaining $750,000 is due and payable in May 2004. 


Mr. Jerome
York, a member of the Board of Directors of the Company, is a member of an investment group that purchased MicroWarehouse, Inc. (MicroWarehouse) in January 2000. Until
September 7, 2003, he also served as its Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. MicroWarehouse is a reseller of computer hardware, software and peripheral products, including products
made by the Company. On September 8, 2003, CDW Corporation (CDW), acquired selected North American assets of MicroWarehouse. MicroWarehouse subsequently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection in the
United States. MicroWarehouse accounted for 2.4%, 3.3%, and 2.9% of the Company's net sales in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Trade receivables from MicroWarehouse were $9.9 million
and $20.9 million as of September 27, 2003, and September 28, 2002, respectively. The Company has provided what it believes to be an adequate allowance on the outstanding
receivable based on the Company's secured interest position in selected MicroWarehouse assets and the expected payments to unsecured creditors. Sales to MicroWarehouse and related trade receivables
were generally subject to the same terms and conditions as those with the Company's other resellers. In addition, the Company purchases miscellaneous equipment and supplies from MicroWarehouse. Total
purchases amounted to approximately $2.3 million, $2.9 million, and $3.4 million in fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS    
 


The
Board of Directors and Shareholders

Apple Computer, Inc.: 


We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Computer, Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 27, 2003. These consolidated financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. 


We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 


In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Apple Computer, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 27,
2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 


As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for asset retirement obligations and for financial instruments with characteristics
of both liabilities and equity in 2003, changed its method of accounting for goodwill in 2002, and changed its method of accounting for hedging activities in 2001.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
 


Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  


Apple
Computer, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) designs, manufactures, and markets personal computers and related personal computing and communicating solutions for sale primarily to
education, creative, consumer, and business customers. 


Basis of Presentation and Preparation  


The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these
consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 


Typically,
the Company's fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of September. Fiscal years 2002 and 2001 were each 52-week years. However, approximately every six years, the Company reports
a 53-week fiscal year to align its fiscal quarters with calendar quarters by adding a week to its first fiscal quarter. Consequently, an additional week was added to the first quarter of
fiscal 2000. All information presented herein is based on the Company's fiscal calendar. 


Financial Instruments  


Investments  


The Company places its short-term investments in highly liquid securities issued by high credit quality issuers. All highly liquid investments with maturities of
three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents; highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as short-term
investments. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments in debt and marketable equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each
balance sheet date. The Company's marketable debt and equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. These securities are carried at fair
value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of shareholders' equity. The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method. 


Derivative Financial Instruments  


On October 1, 2000, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, 
Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities
. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, hedging activities, and exposure definition. SFAS
No. 133 requires that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income. If the
derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through
earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Net of the related income tax effect of approximately $5 million, adoption of SFAS
No. 133 resulted in a favorable cumulative-effect-type adjustment to net income of approximately $12 million. Net of the related income tax effect of approximately
$5 million, adoption of SFAS No. 133 resulted in a favorable cumulative-effect-type adjustment to other comprehensive income of approximately $12 million, all of which
was reclassified to earnings during 2001. Management does not believe that ongoing application of SFAS No. 133 will significantly alter the Company's hedging strategies. However, its
application may increase the volatility of other income and expense and other comprehensive income. 


For
derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are attributable to a particular risk and that are designated as cash flow hedges, the net gain or
loss on the 


53






 



derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction
affects earnings. To receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. For derivative
instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability or an identified portion thereof that are attributable to a particular risk and that are designated as fair
value hedges, the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current
period. The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure of the net investment in a foreign
operation is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For forward contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to
changes in the forward carry
component from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this component are recognized in current earnings. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging
instruments, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in the current period. 


For
foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges, hedge effectiveness is measured based on changes in the fair value of the contract attributable to changes in the forward
exchange rate. Changes in the expected future cash flows on the forecasted hedged transaction and changes in the fair value of the forward hedge are both measured from the contract rate to the forward
exchange rate associated with the forward contract's maturity date. For currency option contracts designated as cash flow hedges, hedge effectiveness is measured based on changes in total fair value
of the option contract. Hedge effectiveness is assessed by comparing the present value of the cumulative change in expected cash flows on the hedged transactions determined as the sum of the
probability-weighted outcomes with respect to the option strike rates with the total change in fair value of the option hedge. For interest rate swap agreements qualifying as fair value hedges, the
Company assumes no ineffectiveness because these swaps meet the criteria for accounting under the short-cut method defined in SFAS No. 133. 


Inventories  


Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. If the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are
made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. 


Property, Plant, and Equipment  


Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use of the declining balance and straight-line methods over the estimated useful
lives of the assets, which are 30 years for buildings, from 2 to 5 years for equipment, and the shorter of lease terms or estimated useful lives for leasehold improvements. The Company
capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related to internal-use
software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 5 years. 


Prior
to the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company had classified capitalized costs related to internal-use software on the balance sheet in other assets. Effective as of
September 29, 2001, and for all other periods presented, the Company has reclassified internal-use software to property, plant, and equipment and reclassified related cash flows for
the purchase or development of internal-use software from cash flow from operations to cash flow from investing activities. 


54






 


Non-Current Debt and Equity Investments  


Investments categorized as non-current debt and equity investments on the consolidated balance sheet are in equity and debt instruments of public companies. They
are not categorized as current assets either because, given their nature, they are not readily convertible into cash or because they represent potentially longer-term investments by the
Company. Further, the fair value of these investments has been subject to a high degree of volatility. The Company's non-current debt and equity investments have been categorized as
available-for-sale requiring that they be carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in equity as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income. However, the Company recognizes an impairment charge to earnings in the event a decline in fair value below the cost basis of one of these investments is determined to be
other-than-temporary. The Company includes recognized gains and losses resulting from the sale or from other-than-temporary declines in fair value
associated with these investments in other income and expense. Occasionally, the Company uses short-term equity derivatives to manage potential dispositions of non-current debt
and equity investments. Any gains or losses associated with such derivatives are recognized currently in other income and expense. 


Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets  


The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to
generate. If property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the
assets exceeds its fair market value. For the three years ended September 28, 2002, the Company has made no material adjustments to its long-lived assets except those made in
connection with the restructuring actions described in Note 5. 


The
Company adopted SFAS No. 142, 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
, in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. SFAS No. 142 requires that
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that they may be impaired. Prior to fiscal 2002, goodwill was amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life. The Company completed its transitional and
annual goodwill impairment tests as of October 1, 2001, and August 30, 2002, respectively, and found no impairment. The Company established reporting units based on its current reporting
structure. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit. 


SFAS
No. 142 also requires that intangible assets with definite lives be amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, 
 
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of
. The Company is currently
amortizing its acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods ranging from 3 to 7 years. 


Foreign Currency Translation  


The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its international non-U.S. functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at
the end of each period. Revenues and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are
credited or charged to "accumulated translation adjustment" included in "accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" in shareholders' equity. The Company's foreign manufacturing subsidiaries and
certain other international subsidiaries that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at year-end exchange 


55






 



rates, and inventories, property, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. Gains and losses from these translations are included in the Company's results of operations. 


Revenue Recognition  


Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of products (hardware, software, and peripherals), consulting and implementation services, and extended warranty and
support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards, including Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97-2, 
Software
Revenue Recognition
, as amended. Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and
collectibility is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped, and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For online sales to individuals, for some sales
to education customers in the United States, and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until product is received by the customer because the Company legally retains a portion of the risk
of loss on these sales during transit. For other product sales, these criteria are met by the Company at the time product is shipped. The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated
commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end user rebates and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. 


Revenue
for consulting and implementation services is recognized upon performance and acceptance by the customer. Revenue from extended warranty and support contracts is recognized ratably over the
contract period. Amounts billed to customers in excess of revenue recognized on extended warranty and support contracts are recognized as deferred revenue until revenue recognition criteria are met. 


Revenue
on arrangements that include multiple elements such as hardware, software, and services is allocated to each element based on vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of each
element. Allocated revenue for each element is recognized when revenue recognition criteria have been met for each element. Vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is generally determined
based on the price charged when each element is sold separately. 


Shipping Costs  


The Company's shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales for all periods presented. 


Warranty Expense  


The Company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred under product warranties at the time related revenue is recognized. 


Research and Development  


Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning
when a product's technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. In most instances, the Company's products are released soon
after technological feasibility has been established. Therefore, costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally all software
development costs have been expensed. 


During
the third and fourth quarter of 2002, the Company incurred substantial development costs associated with the development of Mac OS X version 10.2 (code-named "Jaguar") subsequent to
achievement of technological feasibility as evidenced by public demonstration and release of a developer beta in May 2002 and prior to release of the final version of the product in the fourth
quarter. As such, the Company capitalized approximately $13.3 million of development costs associated with development of 


56






 



Jaguar. Amortization of this asset began in the fourth quarter when Jaguar was shipped and is being recognized on a straight-line basis over 3 years. In addition, during 2002, the
Company also began capitalizing certain costs related to development of its new PowerSchool enterprise student information system. Capitalization, which began upon achievement of technological
feasibility in the first quarter, amounted to approximately $6 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2002. The final version of the enterprise student information system was released
in July. 


During
2001 the Company incurred substantial development costs associated with the development of the original version of Mac OS X, subsequent to release of a public beta version of the product and
prior to release of the final product version. As a result, the Company capitalized approximately $5.4 million of development costs during 2001 associated with development of Mac OS X. Related
amortization is computed by use of the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset of 8 years. 


Total
amortization related to capitalized software development costs was $1.2 million and $350,000 in 2002 and 2001, respectively. 


Advertising Costs  


Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $209 million, $261 million, and $281 million for 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. 


Stock-Based Compensation  


The Company measures compensation expense for its employee stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB)
Opinion 25, 
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
 and has provided pro forma disclosures of the effect on net income and earnings per share as if the
fair value-based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense. The Company has elected to follow APB No. 25 because, as discussed below, the alternative fair value accounting
provided for under SFAS No. 123, 
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
, requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use
in valuing employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares. Under APB Opinion No. 25, when the exercise price of the Company's employee stock options equals the market price of
the underlying stock on the date of the grant, no compensation expense is recognized. 


Pro
forma information regarding net income (loss) per share is required by SFAS No. 123 and has been determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock options granted and
employee stock purchase plan purchases subsequent to September 29, 1995, under the fair value method of that statement. The fair values for these options and stock purchases were estimated at
the date of grant and beginning of the period, respectively, using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options and shares are
amortized to pro forma net income over the options' vesting period and the shares' plan period. 


The
Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option
valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected life of options and the Company's expected stock price volatility. Because the Company's employee stock
options and employee stock purchase plan shares have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect
the fair value estimate, in management's opinion, the existing models do not provide a reliable measure of the fair value of the Company's employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan
shares. 


57






 


For
purposes of the pro forma disclosures pursuant to SFAS No. 123 provided in the Company's annual reports through 2002, the expected volatility assumptions used by the Company have been based
solely on historical volatility rates of the Company's common stock. The Company has made no adjustments to its expected volatility assumptions based on current market conditions, current market
trends, or expected volatility implicit in market traded options on the Company's stock. The Company will continue to monitor the propriety of this approach to developing its expected volatility
assumption and could determine for future periods that adjustments to historical volatility and/or use of a methodology that is based on the expected volatility implicit in market traded options on
the Company's common stock are more appropriate based on the facts and circumstances existing in future periods. 


Earnings Per Common Share  


Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period
increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of common stock had been issued. The dilutive effect of
outstanding options is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The dilutive effect of convertible securities is reflected using the
if-converted method. Dilutive potential shares of common stock related to stock options were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per common share for fiscal 2001 because their
effect would have been antidilutive. 


Stock Split  


On June 21, 2000, the Company affected a two-for-one stock split in the form of a Common Stock dividend to shareholders of record as of
May 19, 2000. All per share data and numbers of Common shares have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. 


Comprehensive Income  


Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under
generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders' equity but are excluded from net income. The Company's other comprehensive income is comprised of foreign currency
translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, from unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as
available-for-sale, and from net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges. 


Segment Information  


The Company reports segment information based on the "management" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions
and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments. Information about the Company's products, major customers, and geographic areas on a company-wide basis is
also disclosed. 


Note 2Financial Instruments

The
Company's U.S. corporate securities include commercial paper, loan participations, certificates of deposit, time deposits and corporate debt securities. Foreign securities include foreign
commercial paper, loan participation, certificates of deposit and time deposits with foreign institutions, most of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. Net unrealized gains on the Company's
investment portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities greater than 1 year, were $20 million as of September 28, 2002 and $11 million as of
September 29, 2001. The Company occasionally sells short-term investments prior to their stated maturities. As a result of such sales, the Company recognized net gains of
$7 million in 2002 and $1 million in 2001. These net gains were included in interest and other income, net. 


As
of September 28, 2002, approximately $1.087 billion of the Company's short-term investments had underlying maturities of between 1 and 5 years. The remaining
short-term investments as of September 28, 2002 all had maturities of between 3 and 12 months. As of September 29, 2001, approximately $313 million of the
Company's short-term investments in U.S. agency securities had underlying maturities of between 1 and 4 years. The remaining short-term investments as of
September 29, 2001, all had maturities of between 3 and 12 months. 


Accounts Receivable  


Trade Receivables  


The Company distributes its products through third-party computer resellers and directly to certain education and consumer customers. The Company generally does not require
collateral from its customers. However, when possible the Company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables through the use of flooring arrangements for selected customers with
third-party financing companies and credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America and Asia. However, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are
outstanding with the Company's distribution and retail channel partners. Trade receivables from a single customer, Ingram Micro, Inc., accounted for approximately 10.8% and 9.4% of net accounts
receivable as of September 28, 2002, and September 29, 2001, respectively.

Non-Trade Receivables  


The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale by the Company of raw material components to these
manufacturing vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these raw material components directly from suppliers. These
non-trade receivables, which are included in the consolidated balances sheets in other current assets, totaled $142 million and $68 million as of September 28, 2002,
and September 29, 2001, respectively. The Company does not recognize any profits on these sales or reflect the sale of these components in its net sales. 


Inventory Prepayment  


In April 2002, the Company made a $100 million prepayment to an Asian supplier for the purchase of components over the following nine months. In return for this
deposit, the supplier agreed to supply the Company with a specified level of components in the three consecutive fiscal quarters ending December 28, 2002. If the supplier fails to supply the
agreed upon level of components in any of those three fiscal quarters, the Company may cancel the arrangement and receive the amount of the prepayment not utilized plus a penalty. Approximately
$53 million of this deposit remained unused as of September 28, 2002, and is reflected in the condensed consolidated balance sheets in other current assets. The amount of the prepayment
not utilized by the Company on or before December 31, 2002, is refundable to the Company by January 31, 2003. 


Although
the supplier's existing debt is unrated, its public debt pricing is consistent with other BBB rated companies. The deposit is unsecured and has no stated interest component. The Company is
imputing an amount to cost of sales and interest income during each period the deposit is outstanding at an appropriate market interest rate to reflect the economics of this transaction. In light of
the supplier's implied debt rating and because the Company's prepayment is unsecured, non-performance by and/or economic deterioration of the supplier could place all or some of the
Company's deposit at risk. 


Derivative Financial Instruments  


The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. Foreign currency forward and option contracts are used to
offset the foreign exchange risk on certain existing assets and liabilities and to hedge the foreign exchange risk on expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenues and cost of sales. From
time to time, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate profile of certain investments and debt. The Company's accounting policies for these instruments are
based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.

The
notional principal amounts for derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of year-end, and do not represent the amount of the Company's
exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amount shown in the table above represents the Company's gross exposure to potential accounting loss on these transactions if all counterparties
failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency exchange and interest rates at each respective date. The Company's exposure to credit loss and
market risk will vary over time as a function of interest rates and currency exchange rates. 


The
estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models using prevailing financial market information as of September 28, 2002 and September 29, 2001. In
certain instances where judgment is required in estimating fair value, price quotes were obtained from several of the Company's counterparty financial institutions. Although the table above reflects
the notional principal,
fair value, and credit risk amounts of the Company's interest rate and foreign exchange instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the
interest rate and foreign exchange instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the
underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. 


Foreign Exchange Risk Management  


The Company enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions primarily to protect against foreign exchange risk associated with existing
assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions and certain probable but not firmly committed transactions. Generally, the Company's practice is to hedge a majority of its existing
material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular
exposures, or availability of appropriate hedging instruments. 


61






 


In
accordance with SFAS No. 133, hedges related to probable but not firmly committed transactions of an anticipatory nature are designated and documented at hedge inception as cash flow hedges
and evaluated for hedge effectiveness quarterly. For currency forward contracts, hedge effectiveness is measured based on changes in the total fair value of the contract attributable to changes in the
forward exchange rate. Changes in the expected future cash flows on the forecasted hedged transaction and changes in the fair value of the forward hedge are both measured from the contract rate to the
forward exchange rate associated with the forward contract's maturity date. 


For
currency option contracts, hedge effectiveness is measured based on changes in the total fair value of the option contract. Hedge effectiveness is assessed by comparing the present value of the
cumulative change in expected future cash flows on the hedged transaction determined as the sum of the probability-weighted outcomes with respect to the option strike rates with the total change in
fair value of the option hedge. The net gains or losses on derivative instruments qualifying as cash flow hedges are reported as components of other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity and
reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any residual changes in fair value of these instruments are recognized in current
earnings in other income and expense. 


To
protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company's U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenues, and the
Company's non-U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries selling in local currencies hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries' functional currency.
Other comprehensive income associated with hedges of foreign currency revenues is recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related sales are recognized, and other comprehensive
income related to inventory purchases is recognized as a component of cost of sales in
the same period as the related costs are recognized. Typically, the Company hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenues and inventory purchases over a time
horizon of 3 to 9 months. 


The
Company also enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain recorded assets and
liabilities in non-functional currencies. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in current earnings in other income and expense as offsets to the changes in the
fair value of the related assets or liabilities. 


The
Company may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to offset the translation and economic exposure of a net investment position in a foreign subsidiary. Hedge effectiveness on forwards
designated as net investment hedges is measured based on changes in the fair value of the contract attributable to changes in the spot exchange rate. The effective portion of the net gain or loss on a
derivative instrument designated as a hedge of the net investment position in a foreign subsidiary is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. Any residual changes in
fair value of the forward contract, including changes in fair value based on the differential between the spot and forward exchange rates are recognized in current earnings in other income and
expense. 


As
discussed above, the Company enters into foreign currency option contracts as items that provide an offset to the re-measurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities denominated
in non-functional currencies. All changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts based on changes in option time value are recorded in current earnings in other income and
expense. Due to market movements, changes in option time value can lead to increased volatility in other income and expense. 


Derivative
instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable that the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified
time period or within a 


62






 





subsequent 2 month time period. Deferred gains and losses in other comprehensive income associated with such derivative instruments are immediately reclassified into earnings in other income
and expense. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are also reflected in current earnings unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions.
During 2002, the Company recorded net gains of $2.5 million in other income and expense related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges due to changes in the Company's
forecast of future net sales and cost of sales and due to prevailing market conditions. During 2001, the Company recorded a net gain of $5.1 million in other income and expense related to the
loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges due to changes in the Company's forecast of future net sales and cost of sales. 


Interest Rate Risk Management  


The Company sometimes enters into interest rate derivative transactions, including interest rate swaps, collars, and floors, with financial institutions in order to better
match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on its
long-term debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the Company's exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. The Company may also enter into interest rate
contracts that are intended to reduce the cost of the interest rate risk management program. The Company does not hold or transact in such financial instruments for purposes other than risk
management. 


As
of September 30, 2000, the Company had entered into interest rate swaps with financial institutions in order to better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its
cash equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on its long-term debt, and to diversify a portion of the Company's exposure away
from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. The interest rate swaps generally required the Company to pay a floating interest rate based on the three- or six-month
U.S. dollar LIBOR and receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of the underlying notional amounts. These swaps effectively converted the Company's fixed-rate 10-year
debt to floating-rate debt and converted a portion of the floating rate investments to fixed rate. The Company assumed no ineffectiveness with regard to the debt interest swaps as each
debt interest rate swap met the criteria for accounting under the short-cut method defined in SFAS No. 133 for fair value hedges of debt instruments. Accordingly, no net gains or
losses were recorded in income relative to the Company's underlying debt interest rate swaps. During fiscal 2001, the Company closed out all of its existing debt interest rate swap positions due to
prevailing market interest rates realizing a gain of $17 million. This gain was deferred, recognized in long-term debt and is being amortized to other income and expense over the
remaining life of the debt. 


The
unrealized loss on the assets swaps as of September 30, 2000, of $5.7 million was deferred and then recognized in income in 2001 as part of the SFAS No. 133 transition
adjustment effective on October 1, 2000. The Company closed out all of its existing interest rate asset swaps during 2001 realizing a gain of $1.1 million. 


As
of September 28, 2002, the Company had no interest rate derivatives outstanding. Due to perceived market risk, the Company entered into interest rate swaps in early 2002. These interest rate
swaps were entered into with financial institutions in order to better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with
its fixed-rate interest expense on its long-term debt. The interest rate swaps required the Company to pay a floating interest rate based on six-month U.S. dollar
LIBOR and receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of the underlying notional amounts. These swaps effectively converted the Company's fixed-rate 10-year debt to
floating-rate debt. The Company assumed no ineffectiveness with regard to the debt interest swaps as each debt interest rate swap met the criteria for accounting under the
short-cut method defined in SFAS No. 133 for fair 


63






 





value hedges of debt instruments. Accordingly, no net gains or losses were recorded in income relative to the Company's underlying debt interest rate swaps during fiscal 2002 until the Company closed
out the positions in late 2002 due to prevailing market interest rates. Closing the debt interest rate swaps resulted in a realized gain of $6 million. This gain was deferred, recognized in
long-term debt and is being amortized to other income and expense over the remaining life of the debt. 


Long-Term Debt  


During 1994, the Company issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 6.5% unsecured notes in a public offering registered with the SEC. The notes were sold at
99.925% of par, for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. The notes pay interest semiannually and mature on February 15, 2004. As of September 28, 2002 and September 29, 2001,
the carrying amount of these notes, including unamortized deferred gains associated with closed debt interest rate swaps, was $316 million and $317 million, respectively, while the fair
value was $299 million and $295 million, respectively. The fair value of the notes is based on their listed market values as of September 28, 2002 and September 29, 2001. 


Non-Current Debt and Equity Investments and Related Gains and Losses  


The Company has held significant investments in EarthLink Network, Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai), ARM Holdings plc (ARM), and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd
(Samsung). These investments have been reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as non-current debt and equity investments, and their combined fair value was $39 million and
$128 million as of September 28, 2002, and September 29, 2001, respectively. 


EarthLink  


In January 2000, the Company invested $200 million in EarthLink, an Internet service provider (ISP). The investment is in EarthLink's Series C Convertible
Preferred Stock, which is convertible by the Company after January 4, 2001, into approximately 7.1 million shares of EarthLink common stock. Concurrent with this investment, EarthLink
and the Company entered into a multi-year agreement to deliver ISP service to Macintosh users in the United States. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company profits from each new Mac
customer that subscribes to EarthLink's ISP service for a specified period of time, and EarthLink is the default ISP in the Company's Internet Setup Software included with all Macintosh computers sold
in the United States. 


During
the second quarter of 2001, the Company determined that the then current decline in the fair value of its investment in EarthLink was other-than-temporary requiring that its cost basis be
written down to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write-down be included in earnings. As a result, the Company recognized a $114 million charge to earnings to
write-down the basis of its investment in EarthLink to $86 million. This charge was included in gains (losses) on non-current investments, net. During the fourth quarter
of 2001, the Company sold a total of approximately 425,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds of approximately $6 million and recorded a gain before taxes of approximately $800,000. As
of September 29, 2001, the Company held 6.7 million shares of EarthLink stock with a fair value of approximately $102 million. 


During
the first quarter of 2002, the Company sold 117,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds of $2 million and a gain before taxes of $223,000. No sales of EarthLink were made in any
of the subsequent quarters of fiscal 2002. However, during the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company determined that the then
current decline in the fair value of its investment in EarthLink was other-than-temporary. As a result, the Company recognized a $44 million charge to earnings to write-down the
basis of its investment in 


64






 





EarthLink to $35 million. This charge was included in gains (losses) on non-current investments, net. As of September 28, 2002, the Company holds 6.5 million shares
of EarthLink stock valued at $35 million. 


Akamai  


In June 1999, the Company invested $12.5 million in Akamai, a global Internet content delivery service. The investment was in the form of convertible preferred
stock that converted into 4.1 million shares of Akamai common stock (adjusted for subsequent stock splits) at the time of Akamai's initial public offering in October 1999. Beginning in
the first quarter of 2000, the Company categorized its shares in Akamai as available-for-sale. The fair value of the Company's investment in Akamai was approximately
$216 million as of September 30, 2000. During 2001, the Company sold a total of approximately 1 million shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of approximately $39 million
and recorded a gain before taxes of approximately $36 million. As of September 29, 2001, the Company held 3.1 million shares of Akamai stock valued at $9 million. 


During
the first quarter of 2002, the Company sold 250,000 shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of $2 million and a gain before taxes of $710,000. No sales of Akamai were made in any of the
subsequent quarters of fiscal 2002. However, during the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company determined that the decline in the fair value of its investment in Akamai was other-than-temporary. As a
result, the Company recognized a $6 million charge to earnings to write-down the basis of its investment in Akamai to $3 million. This charge was included in gains (losses)
on non-current investments, net. As of September 28, 2002, the Company holds 2.9 million shares of Akamai stock valued at $3 million. 


ARM Holdings  


ARM is a publicly held company in the United Kingdom involved in the design and licensing of high performance microprocessors and related technology. During the first quarter
of 2002, the Company sold 4.7 million shares of ARM stock for both net proceeds and a gain before taxes of $21 million. No sales of ARM were made in any of the subsequent quarters of
fiscal 2002. As of September 28, 2002, the Company holds 278,000 shares of ARM stock valued at $578,000. 


During
2001, the Company sold a total of approximately 29.8 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of approximately $176 million and recorded a gain before taxes of approximately
$174 million. As of September 29, 2001, the Company held 5 million shares of ARM stock valued at $17 million. During 2000, the Company sold a total of approximately
45.2 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of approximately $372 million and recorded a gain before taxes of approximately $367 million. 


Samsung  


During the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company invested $100 million in Samsung to assist in the further expansion of Samsung's TFT-LCD
flat-panel display production capacity. The investment was in the form of three year unsecured bonds, which were convertible into approximately 550,000 shares of Samsung common stock
beginning in July 2000. The bonds carried an annual coupon rate of 2% and pay a total yield to maturity of 5% if redeemed at their maturity. The fair value of the Company's investment in
Samsung was approximately $123 million as of September 30, 2000. 


Prior
to its sale, the Company had categorized its investment in Samsung as available-for-sale requiring that it be carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net
of taxes, reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The fair value of the Company's investment in Samsung was approximately $123 million as of
September 30, 2000. With the adoption of SFAS No. 133 on October 1, 2000, the Company was required to account for the conversion option embedded in the 


65






 





Samsung bonds separately from the related debt. The conversion feature was carried at fair value with any changes in fair value recognized in earnings in the period in which they occur. Included in
the $17 million gross SFAS No. 133 transition adjustment recorded in earnings during the first quarter of fiscal 2001 was a $23 million favorable adjustment for the restatement to
fair value as of October 1, 2000, of the derivative component of the Company's investment in Samsung. To adjust the carrying value of the derivative component of its investment in Samsung to
fair value as of December 30, 2000, the Company recognized an unrealized loss of approximately $13 million during the first quarter of 2001. During the second quarter of 2001, the
Company sold this investment for book value, including accrued interest, and received net proceeds of approximately $117 million. 


Other Strategic Investments  


The Company has made additional minority debt and equity investments in several privately held technology companies which were reflected in the consolidated balance sheets in
other assets. These investments are inherently risky because the products and/or markets of these companies are typically not fully developed. During 2001 the Company determined that the decline in
fair value of certain of these investments was other-than-temporary and, accordingly, recognized a charge to earnings of approximately $8 million. This charge was included in gains (losses) on
non-current investments, net. During 2002, the Company determined that the decline in fair value of certain of these investments was other-than-temporary and, accordingly, recognized a
charge to earnings of $15 million. These charges were included in gains (losses) on non-current investments, net. As of September 28, 2002, the Company has no private debt or
equity investments reflected in its consolidated balance sheet.

Acquisition of Emagic  


During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company acquired Emagic GmbH, a provider of professional software solutions for computer based music production, for approximately
$30 million in cash; $26 million of which was paid immediately upon closing of the deal and $4 million of which was held-back for future payment contingent on
continued employment by certain employees that will be allocated to future compensation expense in the appropriate periods over the next 3 years. The acquisition has been accounted for as a
purchase. The portion of the purchase price allocated to purchased in-process research and development (IPR&D) was expensed immediately, and the portion of the purchase price allocated to

acquired technology and to tradename will be amortized over their estimated useful lives of 3 years. Total consideration was allocated as follows (in millions):

The
amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition, because the technological feasibility of products under development had not been established and no alternative
future uses existed. The IPR&D relates primarily to Emagic's Logic series technology and extensions. At the date of the acquisition, the products under development were between 43%-83%
complete, and it was expected that the remaining work would be completed during the Company's fiscal 2003 at a cost of approximately $415,000. The remaining efforts include finalizing user interface
design and development, and testing. The fair value of the IPR&D was determined by an independent third-party valuation using the income approach, which reflects the projected free cash flows that
will be generated by the IPR&D projects and that are attributable to the acquired technology, and discounting the projected net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 25%. 


Acquisition of certain assets of Zayante, Inc., Prismo Graphics, and Silicon Grail  


During fiscal 2002 the Company acquired certain technology and patent rights of Zayante, Inc., Prismo Graphics, and Silicon Grail Corporation for a total of
$20 million in cash. These transactions have been accounted for as asset acquisitions. The purchase price for these asset acquisitions, except for $1 million identified as contingent
consideration which will be allocated to compensation expense over the next 3 years, has been allocated to acquired technology and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over
3 years, except for certain assets acquired from Zayante associated with patent royalty streams that will be amortized over 10 years. 


Acquisition of Nothing Real, LLC  


During the second quarter of 2002, the Company acquired certain assets of Nothing Real, LLC (Nothing Real), a privately-held company that develops and markets high
performance tools designed for the digital image creation market. Of the $15 million purchase price, the Company has allocated $7 million to acquired technology, which will be amortized
over its estimated life of 5 years. The remaining $8 million, which has been identified as contingent consideration, rather than recorded as an
additional component of the cost of the acquired assets, will be allocated to future compensation expense in the appropriate periods over the next 3 years. 


Acquisition of Spruce Technologies, Inc.  


In July 2001, the Company acquired Spruce Technologies, Inc. (Spruce), a privately-held company that develops and markets DVD authoring products, for
$14.9 million in cash. Goodwill associated with the acquisition of Spruce is not subject to amortization pursuant to the transition provisions of SFAS No. 142.

Acquisition of PowerSchool, Inc.  


In May 2001, the Company acquired PowerSchool, Inc. (PowerSchool), a provider of web-based student information systems for K-12 schools
and districts that enables schools to record, access, report, and manage their student data and performance in real-time, and gives parents real-time web access to track their
children's progress. The consolidated financial statements include the operating results of PowerSchool from the date of acquisition. 


The
purchase price of approximately $66.1 million consisted of the issuance of approximately 2.4 million shares of the Company's common stock with a fair value of $61.2 million,
the issuance of stock options with a fair value of $4.5 million, and $300,000 of direct transaction costs. The fair value of the common stock options issued was determined using a Black-Scholes
option pricing model with the following
assumptions: volatility of 67%, expected life of 4 years, dividend rate of 0%, and risk-free rate of 4.73%. Total consideration was allocated as follows (in millions):

The
amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition, because the technological feasibility of products under development had not been established and no alternative
future uses existed. The IPR&D relates to technologies representing processes and expertise employed to design, develop, and deploy a functioning, scalable web-based student information
system for use by K-12 schools. At the date of the acquisition, the product under development was approximately 50% complete, and it was expected that the remaining 50% would be completed
during the Company's fiscal 2002 at a cost of approximately $9.25 million. The remaining efforts, which were completed in 2002, included completion of coding, finalizing user interface design
and development, and testing. The fair value of the IPR&D was determined by an independent third-party valuation using the income approach, which reflects the projected free cash flows that will be
generated by the IPR&D projects and that are attributable to the acquired technology, and discounting the projected net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 25%. The
acquired intangibles are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of three years, respectively. Deferred stock compensation associated with restricted stock and options is being amortized
over the required future vesting period of three years. 


70






 




In
the fourth quarter of 2001, an adjustment was made to increase goodwill associated with the acquisition of PowerSchool by $5.9 million due to the identification of previously unidentified
loss contingencies that were in existence prior to consummation of the acquisition. 


Acquisition-Related Deferred Stock Compensation  


The Company allocated $12.8 million of its purchase consideration for PowerSchool to acquisition-related deferred stock compensation within shareholders' equity. This
amount represents the intrinsic value of stock options assumed that vest as future services are provided by employees and related to 445,000 common shares issued contingent on continued employment of
certain PowerSchool employee stockholders. 


Pro Forma Financial Information  


The unaudited pro forma financial information below presents the condensed consolidated financial results of the Company assuming that PowerSchool and Spruce, acquired in 2001,
had been acquired at the beginning of 2000 and includes the effect of amortization of goodwill and other acquired identifiable intangible assets from that date. The impact of the charge for IPR&D
associated with the acquisition of PowerSchool has been excluded. This pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of

Note 5Special Charges  


Restructuring Actions  


2002 Restructuring Actions  


During fiscal 2002, the Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $30 million related to actions intended to eliminate certain activities and better
align the Company's operating expenses with existing general economic conditions and to partially offset the cost of continuing investments in new product development and investments in the Company's
Retail operating segment. 


During
the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of approximately $6 million designed to reduce headcount costs in
Corporate operations and sales and to adjust its PowerSchool product strategy. These restructuring actions resulted in the elimination of approximately 180 positions worldwide at a cost of
$1.8 million, 161 of which were eliminated by September 28, 2002. Eliminated positions were primarily in Corporate operations, sales, and PowerSchool related research and development.
The shift in product strategy at PowerSchool included discontinuing development and marketing of PowerSchool's PSE product. This shift resulted in the impairment of previously capitalized development
costs associated with the PSE product in the amount of $4.5 million. As of September 28, 2002, substantially all of the $6 million accrual had been utilized, except for
insignificant severance and related costs associated with the 19 remaining positions. 


71








 
 


During the first quarter of 2002, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of approximately $24 million. These
restructuring actions will result in the elimination of approximately 425 positions worldwide, 415 of which were eliminated by September 28, 2002, at a cost of $8 million. Positions were
eliminated primarily in the Company's operations, information systems, and administrative functions. In addition, these restructuring actions also included significant changes in the Company's
information systems strategy resulting in termination of equipment leases and cancellation of existing projects and activities. Related lease and contract cancellation charges totaled
$12 million, and charges for asset impairments totaled $4 million. Of the original $24 million restructuring charge made during the first quarter of 2002, approximately
$23 million had been spent as of September 28, 2002 and approximately $250,000 was reversed during the second quarter of 2002 due to lower actual costs than originally estimated for
certain lease commitments and severance benefits. The remaining $1 million accrual relates primarily to future payments on abandoned operating leases. 


2000 Restructuring Actions  


During the first quarter of 2000, the Company initiated restructuring actions resulting in recognition of an $8 million restructuring charge. This charge was comprised
of $3 million for the write-off of various operating assets and $5 million for severance payments to approximately 95 employees associated with consolidation of various
domestic and international sales and marketing functions. Of the $5 million accrued for severance, $2.5 million had been spent before the end of 2000, and the remainder was spent in
2001. Of the $3 million accrued for the write-off of various assets, substantially all was utilized before the end of 2000. 


Executive Bonus  


During the first quarter of 2000, the Company's Board of Directors approved a special executive bonus for the Company's Chief Executive Officer for past services in the form of
an aircraft with a total cost to the Company of approximately $90 million, the majority of which was not tax deductible. Approximately half of the total charge is for the cost of the aircraft.
The other half represents all other costs and taxes associated with the bonus. In the fourth quarter of 2002, all significant work and payments associated with the aircraft were complete. Of the
original $90 million accrual, $2.4 million remained unspent at the end of fiscal 2002 and was reversed. 


Technology Acquisition  


As discussed in Note 4, during both 2002 and 2001 in its acquisition of Emagic and PowerSchool, respectively, the Company acquired certain technology that was under
development and had no alternative future use. This resulted in the recognition of purchased in-process research and development in the amount of $551,000 for Emagic and
$10.8 million for PowerSchool, which was charged to operations upon acquisition.

Provision for income taxes

The
foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pretax earnings of approximately $284 million, $363 million and $1.019 billion in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. As
of September 28, 2002, approximately half of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments is held by foreign subsidiaries and is generally based in U.S.
dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries would be subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the United States. The Company's consolidated financial statements fully
provide for any related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated, aside from undistributed earnings of certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be indefinitely
reinvested in operations outside the United States. U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $755 million of such earnings. It is not practicable to determine the
income tax liability that might be incurred if these earnings were to be distributed. 


Deferred
tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits, and the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts
of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected
to be recovered or settled.

As
of September 28, 2002, the Company had operating loss carryforwards for federal tax purposes of approximately $72 million, which expire from 2009 through 2021. These carryforwards are
comprised of remaining operating loss carryforwards acquired from NeXT and other acquisitions, the utilization of which is subject to certain limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The
Company also has Federal credit carryforwards and various state and foreign tax loss and credit carryforwards, the tax effect of which is approximately $94 million and which expire between 2003
and 2022. The remaining benefits
from tax losses and credits do not expire. As of September 28, 2002, a valuation allowance of $30 million was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax losses that
may not be realized. The valuation allowance relates primarily to the operating loss carryforwards acquired from NeXT and other acquisitions. Management believes it is more likely than not that
forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully
recover the remaining deferred tax assets.

The
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed audits of the Company's federal income tax returns through 1997. Substantially all IRS audit issues for years through 1997 have been resolved. The IRS
is currently auditing the Company's federal income tax returns for fiscal years 1998 through 2000. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from
tax examinations. 


Note 7Shareholders' Equity  


Stock Repurchase Plan  


In July 1999, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does
not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time. During 2000, the Company repurchased a total of 2.55 million shares of its
common stock at a cost of $116 million. During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company entered into a forward purchase agreement to acquire 1.5 million shares of its common stock in
September of 2003 at an average price of $16.64 per share for a total cost of $25.5 million. The Company engaged in no transactions relating to the stock repurchase plan in fiscal 2002. Since
inception of the repurchase plan, the Company has repurchased or committed to repurchase a total of 6.55 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $217 million. 


Preferred Stock  


In August 1997, the Company and Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft) entered into a patent cross license and technology agreements. In addition, Microsoft purchased 150,000
shares of Apple Series A nonvoting convertible preferred stock ("preferred stock") for $150 million. These shares were convertible by Microsoft after August 5, 2000, into shares
of the Company's common stock at a conversion price of $8.25 per share. During 2000, 74,250 shares of preferred stock were converted to 9 million shares of the
Company's common stock. During 2001, the remaining 75,750 preferred shares were converted into 9.2 million shares of the Company's common stock.

Note 8Employee Benefit Plans  


1998 Executive Officer Stock Plan  


The 1998 Executive Officer Stock Plan (the 1998 Plan) is a shareholder approved plan which replaced the 1990 Stock Option Plan terminated in April 1998, the 1981 Stock
Option Plan terminated in October 1990, and the 1987 Executive Long Term Stock Option Plan terminated in July 1995. Options granted before these plans' termination dates remain
outstanding in accordance with their terms. Options may be granted under the 1998 Plan to the Chairman of the Board of Directors, executive officers of the Company at the 


76






 



level of Senior Vice President and above, and other key employees. These options generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment, and generally expire
10 years after the grant date. The 1998 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, and stock purchase rights. 


1997 Employee Stock Option Plan  


In August 1997, the Company's Board of Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 1997 Plan), a non-shareholder approved plan for grants of
stock options to employees who are not officers of the Company. Options may be granted under the 1997 Plan to employees at not less than the fair market value on the date of grant. These options
generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment, and generally expire 10 years after the grant date. 


1997 Director Stock Option Plan  


In August 1997, the Company's Board of Directors adopted a shareholder approved Director Stock Option Plan (DSOP) for non-employee directors of the Company.
Initial grants of 30,000 options under the DSOP vest in three equal installments on each of the first through third anniversaries of the date of grant, and subsequent annual grants of 10,000 options
are fully vested at grant. Prior to adoption of the DSOP, 60,000 options were granted in total to two then-current members of the Company's Board of Directors. 


Employee Stock Purchase Plan  


The Company has a shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan (the Purchase Plan), under which substantially all employees may purchase common stock through payroll
deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values as of the beginning and end of six-month offering periods. Stock purchases under the Purchase Plan are limited to
10% of an employee's compensation, up to a maximum of $25,000 in any calendar year. During 2002, 2001, and 2000, 1.8 million, 1.8 million and 766,000 shares, respectively, were issued
under the Purchase Plan. As of September 28, 2002, approximately 2.1 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan. 


Employee Savings Plan  


The Company has an employee savings plan (the Savings Plan) qualifying as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the
Savings Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limit ($11,000 for calendar year 2002). The
Company matches 50% to 100% of each employee's contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employee's earnings. The Company's matching contributions to the Savings Plan
were approximately $19 million, $17 million, and $16 million in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.

The
Company had exercisable options to purchase 42.1 million shares outstanding as of September 29, 2001 with a weighted average exercise price of $32.15. As of September 30,
2000, the Company had exercisable options outstanding to purchase 23.7 million shares with a weighted average exercise price of $31.94. 


Note 9Stock-Based Compensation  


Pro
forma information regarding net income (loss) per share is required by SFAS No. 123 and has been determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock options granted and
employee stock purchase plan purchases subsequent to September 29, 1995, under the fair value method of that statement. The fair values for these options and stock purchases were estimated at
the date of grant and beginning of the period, respectively, using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The assumptions used for each of the last three fiscal years and the resulting estimate of
weighted-average fair value per share of options granted during those years are as follows:

Note 10Commitments and Contingencies  


Lease Commitments  


The Company leases various facilities and equipment under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The major facilities leases are for terms of 5 to 10 years and
generally provide renewal options for terms of 3 to 5 additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms of 5 to 12 years and often contain multi-year renewal options. Rent
expense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $92 million, $80 million, and $72 million in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. Future
minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of one year as of September 28, 2002, are as follows (in millions):

Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product  


Although certain components essential to the Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, other key components (including microprocessors and
application-specific integrated circuits, or ("ASICs")) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some other key components, while currently available to the Company from
multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide availability and pricing pressures. In addition, the Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer
industry, and new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for and
subsequently qualifies additional suppliers. If the supply of a key single-sourced component to the Company were to be delayed or curtailed or in the event a key manufacturing 


80






 



vendor delays shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company's ability to ship related products in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely affected. The Company's
business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient
quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of
components customized to meet the Company's requirements. Finally, significant portions of the Company's CPUs, logic boards, and assembled products are now manufactured by outsourcing partners, the
majority of which occurs in various parts of Asia. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules and levels, the Company's operating results could be
adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production obligations. 


Contingencies  


Beginning on September 27, 2001, three shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against
the Company and its Chief Executive Officer. These lawsuits are substantially identical, and purport to bring suit on behalf of persons who purchased the Company's publicly traded common stock between
July 19, 2000, and September 28, 2000. The complaints allege violations of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. The Company
believes these claims are without merit and intends to defend them vigorously. The Company filed a motion to dismiss on June 4, 2002, which was heard by the Court on September 13, 2002.
On December 11, 2002, the Court granted the Company's motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action, with leave to plaintiffs to amend their complaint within thirty days. 


The
Company is subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully adjudicated. In the opinion of management, the Company
does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.
However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved
against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. 


The
parliament of the European Union is working on finalizing the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (the Directive). The Directive makes producers of electrical goods, including
personal computers, financially responsible for the collection, recycling, and safe disposal of past and future products. The Directive must now be approved and implemented by individual European
Union governments by June 2004, while the producers' financial obligations are scheduled to start June 2005. The Company's potential liability resulting from the Directive related to
past sales of its products and expenses associated with future sales of its product may be substantial. However, because it is likely that specific laws, regulations, and enforcement policies will
vary significantly between individual European member states, it is not currently possible to estimate the Company's existing liability or future expenses resulting from the Directive. As the European
Union and its individual member states clarify specific requirements and policies with respect to the Directive, the Company will continue to assess its potential financial impact. Similar legislation
may be enacted in other geographies, including federal and state legislation in the United States, the cumulative impact of which could be significant.

Note 11Segment Information and Geographic Data  


The
Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas segment includes both North
and South America, except for the activities of the Company's Retail segment. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Japan segment includes only
Japan. The Retail segment operates Apple-owned retail stores in the United States. Other operating segments include Asia-Pacific, which includes Australia and Asia except for Japan, and
the Company's subsidiary, Filemaker, Inc. Each reportable geographic operating segment provides similar products and services, and the accounting policies of the various segments are the same
as those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1, except as described below for the Retail segment. 


The
Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are based on the location of the customers. Operating income
for each segment includes revenue from third-parties, cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense
and certain expenses that are managed outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses, manufacturing costs not included in standard
costs, income taxes, and various nonrecurring charges. Corporate expenses include research and development, corporate marketing expenses, and other separately managed general and administrative
expenses including certain corporate expenses associated with support of the Retail segment. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.
Segment assets exclude corporate assets. Corporate assets include cash, short-term and long-term investments, manufacturing facilities, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure,
goodwill and other acquired intangible assets, and retail store construction-in-progress which is not subject to depreciation. Except for the Retail segment, capital
expenditures for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment. Capital expenditures by the Retail segment were $106 million in 2002 and $92 million in 2001. 


Operating
income for all segments except Retail includes cost of sales at standard cost. Certain manufacturing expenses and related adjustments not included in segment cost of sales, including
variances between standard and actual manufacturing costs and the mark-up above standard cost for product supplied to the Retail segment, are included in corporate expenses. 


To
assess the operating performance of the Retail segment several significant items are included in its results for internal management reporting that are not included in results of the Company's
other segments. First, cost of sales for the Retail segment includes a mark-up above the Company's standard cost to approximate the price normally charged to the Company's major channel
partners in the United States. For the twelve-month period ended September 28, 2002 and September 29, 2001, this resulted in the recognition of additional cost of sales above standard
cost by the Retail segment and an offsetting benefit to corporate expenses of approximately $52 million and $4 million, respectively. Second, the Retail segment includes in its net sales
proceeds from sales of the Company's extended warranty and support contracts. This treatment is consistent with how the Company's major channel partners account for the sale of the Company's extended
warranty and support contracts. Because the revenue from these contracts has yet to be earned by the Company, an offset to this amount is reflected as a decrease in other segments' net sales. For the
twelve-month period ended September 28, 2002, this resulted in the recognition of additional net sales by the Retail segment, and an offsetting reduction to other segments' net sales of
$4.8 million. This amount was insignificant in 2001. Third, a portion of the operating expenses associated with certain high profile retail stores are allocated from the Retail segment to
corporate marketing expense. Allocation of these expenses reflects the unique nature of these stores which, given their larger size and extraordinary design elements, function as vehicles for general
corporate marketing, corporate events, and brand 


82






 





awareness. Allocated operating costs are those in excess of operating costs incurred by one of the Company's more typical retail locations. Stores were open in two such high profile locations in New
York and Los Angeles as of September 28, 2002, both of which were opened in fiscal 2002. Expenses allocated to corporate marketing resulting from the operations of these two stores was
$1 million in 2002.

A
large portion of the Company's net sales is derived from its international operations. Also, a majority of the raw materials used in the Company's products is obtained from sources outside of the
United States, and a majority of the products sold by the Company is assembled internationally in the Company's facilities in Cork, Ireland and Singapore or by third-party vendors in Taiwan, Korea,
Mexico, the People's Republic of China, and the Czech Republic. As a result, the Company is subject to risks associated with foreign operations, such as obtaining governmental permits and approvals,
currency exchange fluctuations, currency restrictions, political instability, labor problems, trade restrictions, and changes in tariff and freight charges. During 2000, a single distributor, Ingram
Micro Inc. accounted for approximately 11.5% of the Company's net sales. Net sales during 2000 to Ingram Micro Inc. in the Americas and Europe segments were $651 million and
$255 million, respectively. Net sales to Ingram Micro Inc. in all other segments were $14 million. No other single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2000. No
single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2002 or 2001.

Options
to purchase 101.8 million shares of common stock were outstanding at the end of 2002 that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for that year because the
options' exercise price was greater than the average market price of the Company's common shares for that year and, therefore, the effect would be antidilutive. At September 29, 2001, the
Company had options to purchase 97.2 million shares of its common stock outstanding, all of which were excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share for 2001 because the effect would
have been antidilutive. Options to purchase 2.5 million shares of common stock were outstanding at the end of 2000 that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for
that year because the options' exercise price was greater than the average market price of the Company's common shares for that year and, therefore, the effect would be antidilutive. 


Note 13Related Party Transactions  


Mr. Jerome
York, a member of the Board of the Directors of the Company, is a member of an investment group that purchased MicroWarehouse, Inc.
("
MicroWarehouse
") in January 2000. He also serves as its Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. MicroWarehouse is a multi-billion
dollar specialty catalog and online retailer and direct marketer of computer products, including products made by the 


86






 



Company, through its MacWarehouse catalog. MicroWarehouse accounted for 3.3% and 2.89% of the Company's net sales in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Trade receivables from MicroWarehouse were
$20.9 million and $7.6 million as of September 28, 2002, and September 29, 2001, respectively. These receivables are subject to the same credit risk as the Company's other
trade receivables. In addition, the Company purchases miscellaneous equipment and supplies from MicroWarehouse. Total purchases amounted to approximately $2.9 million in 2002 and
$3.4 million in 2001. 


In
March 2002, the Company entered into a Reimbursement Agreement with its Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Steven P. Jobs, for the reimbursement of expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs in
the operation of his private plane when used for Apple business. The Reimbursement Agreement is effective for expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs for Apple business purposes since he took delivery of
the plane in May 2001. During 2002, the Company recognized a total of $1,168,000 in expenses pursuant to this reimbursement agreement related to expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs during 2001
and 2002. 


In
connection with a relocation assistance package, the Company loaned Mr. Ronald B. Johnson, Senior Vice President, Retail, $1.5 million for the purchase of his principal residence. The
loan is secured by a deed of trust and is due and payable in May 2004. Under the terms of the loan, Mr. Johnson agreed that should he exercise any of his stock options prior to the due
date of the loan, that he would pay the Company an amount equal to the lesser of (1) an amount equal to 50% of the total net gain realized
from the exercise of the options; or (2) $375,000 multiplied by the number of years between the exercise date and the date of the loan.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

The Shareholders and Board of Directors of Apple Computer, Inc.

We  have  audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  of  Apple
Computer, Inc. as of September 29, 1995 and September 30, 1994,  and  the
related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 1995.
Our  audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
Index  to  Consolidated Financial Statements.  These financial statements
and  schedule  are the responsibility of the Company's management.   Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedule based on our audits.

We  conducted  our audits in accordance with generally accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain  reasonable assurance about whether the financial  statements  are
free  of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on  a  test
basis,  evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures  in the financial
statements.   An audit also includes assessing the accounting  principles
used  and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In  our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to  above
present  fairly,  in  all  material respects, the consolidated  financial
position of Apple Computer, Inc. at September 29, 1995 and September  30,
1994,  and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash  flows
for  each  of the three years in the period ended September 29, 1995,  in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  Also,  in  our
opinion,  the  related financial statement schedule, when  considered  in
relation  to  the  basic financial statements taken as a  whole,  present
fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation
The  consolidated  financial statements include  the  accounts  of  Apple
Computer, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company).  Intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated.  The Company's fiscal year-end  is
the last Friday in September.

Revenue Recognition
The  Company  recognizes  revenue  at  the  time  products  are  shipped.
Provisions  are  made currently for estimated product returns  and  price
protection  that may occur under Company programs.  Historically,  actual
amounts recorded for product returns and price protection have not varied
significantly from estimated amounts.

Warranty Expense
The  Company  provides  currently for the  estimated  cost  that  may  be
incurred under product warranties when products are shipped.

Advertising Costs
Advertising  costs,  except  for  costs associated  with  direct-response
advertising, are charged to expense the first time the advertising  takes
place.    The  costs of direct-response advertising are  capitalized  and
amortized over the period during which future benefits are expected to be
received.

Foreign Currency
Gains  and  losses  resulting  from  foreign  currency  translation   are
accumulated  as  a separate component of shareholders' equity  until  the
foreign  entity  is sold or liquidated. Gains and losses  resulting  from
foreign  currency transactions are included in the consolidated statement
of income.

Financial Instruments
Investments
All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less  at
the  date  of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents; investments
with  maturities  between three and twelve months are  considered  to  be
short-term investments.  There are no investments with maturities greater
than  twelve months.  A substantial portion of the Company's  cash,  cash
equivalents,  and short-term investments is held by foreign  subsidiaries
and is generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings.  Amounts held
by  foreign  subsidiaries would be subject to U.S. income  taxation  upon
repatriation  to  the  United States; the Company's financial  statements
fully  provide  for  any related tax liability on  amounts  that  may  be
repatriated,  aside from undistributed earnings that are intended  to  be
indefinitely invested.

Effective  October  1,  1994,  the Company adopted  Financial  Accounting
Standard No. 115 ("FAS 115"), "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and  Equity  Securities."   In  accordance with  FAS  115,  prior  period
financial  statements  have not been restated to reflect  the  change  in
accounting  principle.   The cumulative effect  of  the  change  was  not
material  to shareholders' equity as of October 1, 1994.  Under FAS  115,
debt  securities that a company has both the positive intent and  ability
to  hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost.  Debt securities that
a  company  does  not  have the positive intent and ability  to  hold  to
maturity  and all marketable equity securities are classified  as  either
available-for-sale or trading and are carried at fair value.   Generally,
unrealized holding gains and losses on securities classified as available-
for-sale are reported as a component of shareholders' equity.  Unrealized
holding gains and losses on securities classified as trading are included
in earnings.

The  Company's  cash  equivalents consist primarily  of  U.S.  Government
securities, Euro-dollar deposits, and commercial paper with maturities of
three  months  or  less at the date of purchase.  Short-term  investments
consist  principally of Euro-dollar deposits and  commercial  paper  with
maturities  between  three and twelve months.  The  Company's  marketable
equity  securities consist of securities issued by U.S. corporations  and
are included in "Other assets" on the accompanying balance sheet.  As  of
September   29,   1995,   the  Company's  cash  equivalents,   short-term
investments,   and  marketable  equity  securities  are  classified   and
accounted  for  as  available-for-sale  and  are  generally  held   until
maturity.

Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk
In the ordinary course of business and as part of the Company's asset and
liability   management,  the  Company  enters  into  various   types   of
transactions that involve contracts and financial instruments  with  off-
balance-sheet  risk.   These instruments are entered  into  in  order  to
manage  financial  market  risk,  primarily  interest  rate  and  foreign
exchange risk.  The Company enters into these financial instruments  with
major international financial institutions utilizing over-the-counter  as
opposed  to  exchange traded instruments.  The Company does not  hold  or
transact   in  financial  instruments  for  other  than  risk  management
purposes.

                                        
                                       24



Gains  and  losses on accounting hedges of existing assets or liabilities
are  included in the carrying amounts of those assets or liabilities  and
are  ultimately  recognized in income as part of those carrying  amounts.
Gains  and  losses  related  to  qualifying  accounting  hedges  of  firm
commitments  or  anticipated  transactions  are  also  deferred  and  are
recognized  in  income  or as adjustments of carrying  amounts  when  the
hedged  transaction occurs.  Realized and unrealized gains and losses  on
interest  rate  and  foreign exchange contracts that do  not  qualify  as
accounting hedges are recognized quarterly as a component of interest and
other income (expense), net.

The  Company  monitors its interest rate and foreign  exchange  positions
daily  based  on  applicable  and  commonly  used  pricing  models.   The
correlation  between the changes in the fair value of hedging instruments
and  the  changes in the underlying hedged items is assessed periodically
over  the  life  of  the  hedged instrument.  In the  event  that  it  is
determined that a hedge is ineffective, the Company recognizes in  income
the change in market value of the instrument beginning on the date it was
no longer an effective hedge.

Interest Rate Derivatives
The  Company enters into interest rate derivative transactions, including
interest rate swaps and options, with financial institutions in order  to
better  match  the Company's floating-rate interest income  on  its  cash
equivalents  and  short-term  investments with  the  fixed-rate  interest
expense  of  its  long-term debt.  These instruments  are  also  used  to
diversify  a portion of the Company's exposure away from fluctuations  in
short-term  U.S.  interest  rates.   The  Company  may  also  enter  into
interest  rate  contracts that are intended to reduce  the  cost  of  the
interest rate risk management program.

Foreign Currency Instruments
The  Company  enters into foreign exchange forward and  option  contracts
with   financial  institutions  primarily  to  protect  against  currency
exchange risks associated with certain firmly committed and certain other
probable,  but not firmly committed transactions.  The Company's  foreign
exchange  risk management policy requires it to hedge a majority  of  its
existing  material foreign exchange transaction exposures.  However,  the
Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures that
are  immaterial either in terms of their minimal U.S. dollar value  or  in
terms of their high correlation with the U.S. dollar.

Probable,  but not firmly committed transactions comprise  sales  of  the
Company's products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.  A  majority
of  these  non-U.S.  dollar-based sales are made  through  the  Company's
subsidiaries in Europe, Asia (particularly Japan), Canada, and Australia.
The  Company  also purchases foreign exchange option contracts  to  hedge
certain  other  probable,  but  not firmly committed  transactions.   The
Company  also  sells  foreign  exchange option  contracts,  in  order  to
partially finance the purchase of foreign exchange option contracts  used
to hedge both firmly committed and certain other probable, but not firmly
committed  transactions.   In addition, the  Company  enters  into  other
foreign  exchange  transactions, which are intended to reduce  the  costs
associated  with  its  foreign exchange risk  management  programs.   The
duration  of  foreign exchange hedging instruments,  whether  for  firmly
committed   transactions  or  for  probable,  but  not  firmly  committed
transactions, currently does not exceed one year.

For  further information regarding the Company's accounting treatment  of
its investments and other financial and derivative instruments, refer  to
pages 26 - 28 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Income Taxes

The  income  tax  provisions for 1995 and 1994 have  been  determined  in
accordance with statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 109  ("FAS
109"),  "Accounting  for Income Taxes," whereby deferred  tax  assets  and
liabilities   reflect  the  future  income  tax  effects   of   temporary
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of  existing
assets  and  liabilities and their respective tax  bases.   Deferred  tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to
taxable  income  in  the years in which those temporary  differences  are
expected  to  be  recovered or settled.   The  Company  adopted  FAS  109
effective  the first day of fiscal 1994 on a prospective basis,  and  the
financial statements of years ended prior to 1994 have not been restated.
The cumulative effect of the change was not material.  Prior to 1994, the
Company  accounted for income taxes under the provisions of  APB  Opinion
No.  11,  which  recognized  deferred taxes  for  the  effect  of  timing
differences  between pretax accounting income and taxable income.   Under
the  deferred  method  of  APB Opinion No. 11, deferred  taxes  were  not
adjusted for subsequent changes in tax rates.

U.S.  income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total  of  $395
million  of  undistributed earnings of certain of the  Company's  foreign
subsidiaries.   It is intended that these earnings will  be  indefinitely
invested  in  operations  outside  of  the  United  States.   It  is  not
practicable to determine the income tax liability that might be  incurred
if  these  earnings were to be distributed.  Except for such indefinitely
invested  earnings,  the Company provides for federal  and  state  income
taxes currently on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.

Earnings per Share
Earnings  per  share  is computed using the weighted  average  number  of
   common and dilutive common equivalent shares attributable

                                       25



to  stock  options  outstanding during the period.   Loss  per  share  is
computed  using the weighted average number of common shares  outstanding
during the period.

Inventories
Inventories  are  stated  at the lower of cost (first-in,  first-out)  or
market.   If  the  cost  of the inventories exceeds their  market  value,
provisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the
market value.

Property, Plant, and Equipment
Property,  plant,  and  equipment is stated at  cost.   Depreciation  and
amortization  is computed by use of the declining balance  and  straight-
line methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets.

Stock-Based Compensation
The  Company  has  not  elected early adoption  of  Financial  Accounting
Standard  No. 123 ("FAS 123"), "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation."
FAS  123 becomes effective beginning with the Company's first quarter  of
fiscal  year  1997, and will not have a material effect on the  Company's
financial position or results of operations.  Upon adoption of  FAS  123,
the  Company will continue to measure compensation expense for its stock-
based  employee  compensation  plans using  the  intrinsic  value  method
prescribed  by  APB  Opinion  No.  25, "Accounting  for  Stock  Issued  to
Employees"  and  will provide pro forma disclosures  of  net  income  and
earnings  per share as if the fair value-based method prescribed  by  FAS
123 had been applied in measuring compensation expense.

Reclassifications
Certain  prior  year  amounts  on  the Consolidated  Balance  Sheets  and
Consolidated  Statements  of  Cash Flows and  the  Industry  Segment  and
Geographic  Information and Income Taxes footnotes have been reclassified
to conform to the current year presentation.

(A)   The  $2  million represents gross unrealized gains on  interest  rate
hedging transactions.

Gross unrealized holding gains or losses on available-for-sale securities
are  recorded  as  a component of shareholders' equity, and  include  any
unrealized gains and losses on interest rate contracts accounted  for  as
hedges  against the underlying securities.  Of the $42 million  of  gross
unrealized gains related to equity securities, approximately $40  million
relates to securities that are restricted from sale until February  1996.
The  gross realized gains recorded to earnings on sales of available-for-
sale  securities were $1.5 million in 1995.  There were no gross realized
losses recorded to earnings on sales of available-for-sale securities  in
1995.    The   cost  of  securities  sold  is  based  on   the   specific
identification method.

Interest Rate Derivatives and Foreign Currency Instruments
The table on page 27 shows the notional principal, fair value, and credit
risk amounts of the Company's interest rate derivative and

                                       26



foreign currency instruments as of September 29, 1995, and September  30,
1994.   The  notional principal amounts for off-balance-sheet instruments
provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of year end,
and  do  not represent the amount of the Company's exposure to credit  or
market  loss.  The credit risk amount shown in the table below represents
the  Company's  gross  exposure to potential  accounting  loss  on  these
transactions  if  all counterparties failed to perform according  to  the
terms  of  the  contract,  based on then-current  currency  exchange  and
interest rates at each respective date.  The Company's exposure to credit
loss  and market risk will vary over time as a function of interest rates
and currency exchange rates.

The  estimates  of fair value are based on applicable and  commonly  used
pricing  models  using  prevailing financial  market  information  as  of
September  29, 1995, and September 30, 1994.  In certain instances  where
judgment is required in estimating fair value, price quotes were obtained
from  several  of  the  Company's  counterparty  financial  institutions.
Although the table below reflects the notional principal, fair value, and
credit  risk amounts of the Company's interest rate and foreign  exchange
instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with  the
exposures  and  transactions that the interest rate and foreign  exchange
instruments are intended to hedge.  The amounts ultimately realized  upon
settlement  of these financial instruments, together with the  gains  and
losses  on  the  underlying  exposures,  will  depend  on  actual  market
conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.

The  interest rate swaps shown above generally require the Company to pay
a  floating interest rate based on the three- or six-month U.S. dollar  LIBOR
and  receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of the underlying
notional amounts.  Maturity dates for interest rate swaps currently range
from  one  to ten years.  At September 29, 1995, and September 30,  1994,
interest  rate  swaps  classified  as receive-fixed  swaps  had  weighted
average receive rates of 6.38% and 5.89%, respectively.  Weighted average
pay  rates on these swaps were 5.88% and 6.52% at September 29, 1995, and
September 30, 1994, respectively.  Interest rate option contracts require
the  Company  to make payments should certain interest rates either  fall
below or rise above predetermined levels.

Interest  rate  collars limit the Company's exposure to  fluctuations  in
short-term  interest rates by locking in a range of  interest  rates.  An
interest  rate collar is a no-cost structure that consists of a purchased
option and a sold option. The Company receives a payment when the three-month
LIBOR  falls below predetermined levels, and makes a payment when the three-
month  LIBOR  rises  above  predetermined levels.  The  entire  structure
generally qualifies as an accounting hedge.

All  interest  rate option contracts outstanding at September  29,  1995,
expire within three years.

Interest rate contracts not accounted for as hedges are carried  at  fair
value with gains and losses recorded currently in income as a

                                       27



component of interest and other income (expense), net.  Unrealized  gains
and  losses on interest rate contracts that are designated and  effective
as hedges are deferred and recognized in income in the same period as the
hedged   transaction.   Unrealized  losses  on  such  agreements  totaled
approximately  $9  million and $40 million at  September  29,  1995,  and
September  30, 1994, respectively, primarily reflecting the  net  present
value  of  unrealized  losses  on  the  ten-year  swap  contracts,  which
effectively  convert the Company's fixed-rate ten-year debt to  floating-
rate debt.

The  foreign exchange forward contracts not accounted for as  hedges  are
carried  at  fair  value  and are adjusted each balance  sheet  date  for
changes in exchange rates, and the adjustment is recognized in income  at
that  time.   Unrealized  gains and losses on  foreign  exchange  forward
contracts  that are designated and effective as hedges are  deferred  and
recognized  in  income  in  the same period as the  hedged  transactions.
Deferred  gains and losses on such agreements at September 29, 1995,  and
September  30,  1994,  were  immaterial.  All  foreign  exchange  forward
contracts expire within one year.

Purchased  foreign  exchange  option contracts  that  qualify  for  hedge
accounting  treatment are reported on the balance sheet  at  the  premium
cost,  which is amortized over the life of the option.  Unrealized  gains
and losses on these option contracts are deferred until the occurrence of
the  hedged  transaction  and recognized as a  component  of  the  hedged
transaction.    Deferred  gains  and  losses  on  such  agreements   were
immaterial  at  September  29,  1995, and  September  30,  1994.   As  of
September 29, 1995, maturity dates for purchased foreign exchange  option
contracts ranged from one to twelve months.

Purchased and sold foreign exchange option contracts that do not  qualify
for  hedge accounting treatment are carried at fair value and,  as  such,
are  adjusted  each  balance sheet date for changes  in  exchange  rates.
Gains and losses associated with these financial instruments are recorded
currently in income.  As of September 29, 1995, maturity dates for  these
sold option contracts ranged from one to six months.

The  Company  monitors its interest rate and foreign  exchange  positions
daily  based  on  applicable  and  commonly  used  pricing  models.   The
correlation  between the changes in the fair value of hedging instruments
and  the  changes in the underlying hedged items is assessed periodically
over  the  life  of  the  hedged instrument.  In the  event  that  it  is
determined that a hedge is ineffective, the Company recognizes in  income
the change in market value of the instrument beginning on the date it was
no longer an effective hedge.

Fair Values of Other Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company's other financial
instruments are as follows:

Short-term  investments are carried at cost plus accrued interest,  which
approximates  fair  value.  The carrying amount of short-term  borrowings
approximates  their fair value due to their short-term  maturities.   The
fair  value  of  the ten-year unsecured notes is based  on  their  listed
market value as of September 29, 1995.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

The  Company  distributes  its products principally  through  third-party
computer   resellers   and  various  education  and  consumer   channels.
Concentrations  of  credit  risk with respect to  trade  receivables  are
limited  because  of  flooring arrangements for selected  customers  with
third-party  financing companies and because the Company's customer  base
consists  of large numbers of geographically diverse customers  dispersed
across  several  industries.   As such, the Company  generally  does  not
require collateral from its customers.

The   counterparties  to  the  agreements  relating  to   the   Company's
investments and foreign exchange and interest rate instruments consist of
a number of major international financial institutions.  To date, no such
counterparty has failed to meet its financial obligations to the Company.
The  Company  does  not  believe  that  there  is  significant  risk   of
nonperformance  by  these counterparties because the Company  continually
monitors its positions and the credit ratings of such counterparties, and
limits the financial

                                       28



exposure  and the number of agreements and contracts it enters into  with
any  one  party.  The Company generally does not require collateral  from
counterparties, except for margin agreements associated with the ten-year
interest  rate  swaps on the Company's long-term debt.  To  mitigate  the
credit risk associated with these ten-year swap transactions, the Company
entered   into   margining   agreements   with   its   third-party   bank
counterparties.   Margining under these agreements does not  start  until
1997.   Furthermore, these agreements would require the  Company  or  the
counterparty  to post margin only if certain credit risk thresholds  were
exceeded.

Advertising Costs

There  were  no direct-response advertising costs reported as  assets  at
September  29,  1995,  and September 30, 1994.  Advertising  expense  was
$204.7  million, $158.2 million, and $153.4 million for 1995,  1994,  and
1993, respectively.

The  weighted  average interest rates for Japanese yen-denominated  notes
payable  to  banks at September 29, 1995, and September  30,  1994,  were
approximately 2.2% and 2.6%, respectively.  The weighted average interest
rate for U.S. dollar-denominated notes payable to banks at September  29,
1995, was approximately 6.2%.  The Company had no U.S. dollar-denominated
notes  payable  to  banks at September 30, 1994.   The  weighted  average
interest rate for commercial paper borrowings at September 30, 1994,  was
approximately 5.0%.  Interest expense on short-term borrowings was  $20.4
million,  $24.9  million,  and $8.9 million for  1995,  1994,  and  1993,
respectively.

Long-Term Debt

On February 10, 1994, the Company issued $300 million aggregate principal
amount  of 6.5% unsecured notes in a public offering registered with  the
Securities  and Exchange Commission.  The notes were sold at  99.925%  of
par, for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%.  The notes pay interest
semi-annually and mature on February 15, 2004.  Interest expense on long-
term debt for the years ended September 29, 1995, and September 30, 1994,
was $19.5 million and $12.5 million, respectively.

For  information regarding the Company's estimated fair value  of  short-
term  and  long-term debt, refer to page 28 of the Notes to  Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Restructuring of Operations

In the third quarter of 1993, the Company initiated a plan to restructure
its  operations worldwide in order to address the competitive  conditions
in  the personal computer industry, including the increased market demand
for  lower-priced  products.  In connection with this plan,  the  Company
recorded  a  $321 million charge to operating expenses ($199 million,  or
$1.72  per  share, after taxes).  The restructuring costs  included  $162
million  of  estimated  employee-related expenses  and  $159  million  of
estimated facilities, equipment, and other expenses associated  with  the
consolidation of operations and the relocation and termination of certain
operations and employees.  The restructuring plan originally contemplated
the  termination or relocation of approximately 4,150 employees worldwide
and  a reduction in worldwide office space, which primarily consisted  of
approximately  1.6  million  square feet  of  office  space  in  the  San
Francisco  Bay Area, within one year from the date the restructuring  was
initiated.

In  the  third quarter of 1994, the Company lowered its estimate  of  the
total costs associated with the restructuring and recorded an
adjustment that increased income by $127 million ($79 million,  or  $0.66
per  share,  after  taxes).   This  adjustment  primarily  reflected  the
modification or cancelation of certain elements of the Company's original
restructuring  plan because of changing business and economic  conditions
that  made  certain elements of the restructuring plan  financially  less
attractive  than originally anticipated.  In addition, some actions  were
completed at a lower cost than originally estimated.

The  most  significant element of the adjustment was associated with  $61
million in costs accrued to terminate or move a number of employees  from
the San Francisco Bay Area to a lower-cost location.  This element of the
Company's restructuring plan was expected to result in the termination or
relocation  of approximately 2,000 employees and the closure  of  certain
leased facilities, at a

                                       29



cost of $39 million and $22 million, respectively.  However, the expected
benefits of this move were reduced since the plan's inception because  of
changes  to  the  cost  differential between the  Company's  current  and
alternative  locations.  For example, the Company favorably  renegotiated
the  lease  terms  of  certain facilities in its current  locations,  the
salary  growth  rate differentials between the Bay Area  and  alternative
locations  were  reduced, and changes to the California income  tax  laws
made it more attractive for companies to do business in California.   The
Company  canceled  this  action  in  the  third  quarter  of  1994,  when
management decided that the extended estimated pay-back period no  longer
justified  the  initial  cash investment and the unquantifiable  cost  of
business disruption that such a move would precipitate.

At  the  end of fiscal year 1994, approximately 1,760 employees had  been
terminated  at  a  cost  of  approximately  $95  million  in  termination
benefits,  and  approximately 80 had been  relocated.   The  Company  had
reduced  its use of office space in the Bay Area by approximately 867,000
square feet.

During  1995,  the  Company further lowered its estimates  of  the  total
remaining costs associated with its restructuring plan initiated  in  the
third quarter of 1993 and recorded an adjustment that increased income by
$23  million  ($14  million,  or $0.12 per  share,  after  taxes).   This
adjustment  primarily  reflected  favorable  cancelation  settlements  of
certain R&D project commitments and facility leases and the completion of
other actions at lower costs than originally estimated.

As  of  September  29,  1995,  the Company had  $11  million  of  accrued
restructuring  costs  for  actions that  are  currently  under  way,  the
majority   of   which   are  expected  to  be  completed   during   1996.
Approximately  $10  million  of  this  accrual  represents  cash  charges
expected  to  be  incurred primarily for estimated facilities  and  other
expenses.

The  foreign  provision  for  income taxes is  based  on  foreign  pretax
earnings of approximately $572 million, $474 million, and $416 million in
1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.  The tax benefit credited directly to
common stock as a result of compensation expense attributable to employee
stock  option  and  purchase plans recognized differently  for  financial
reporting and tax purposes was $15 million in 1995.

Under  FAS  109, deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect  the  future
income  tax  effects  of  temporary  differences  between  the  financial
statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective
tax bases.

At September 29, 1995, and September 30, 1994, the significant components
of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities were:

The  net change in the total valuation allowance was an increase of $3 million
and $11 million in 1995 and 1994, respectively.

Under  APB  Opinion  No.  11, deferred income taxes  result  from  timing
differences  between  years in the recognition  of  certain  revenue  and
expense  items for financial and tax reporting purposes.  The sources  of
timing differences and the related tax effects for 1993 are as follows:

The  Internal  Revenue Service ("IRS") has proposed  federal  income  tax
deficiencies  for the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company  has  made
certain   prepayments  thereon.   The  Company  contested  the   proposed
deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1988, and most of the  issues  in
dispute  for these years have been resolved.  On June 29, 1995,  the  IRS
issued  a notice of deficiency proposing increases to the amount  of  the
Company's  federal  income taxes for the years 1989  through  1991.   The
Company  has filed a petition with the United States Tax Court to contest
these  alleged  tax  deficiencies.   Management  believes  that  adequate
provision  has been made for any adjustments that may result  from  these
tax examinations.

Common Stock

Shareholder Rights Plan
In   May  1989,  the  Company  adopted  a  shareholder  rights  plan  and
distributed a dividend of one right to purchase one share of common stock
(a  "Right")  for each outstanding share of common stock of the  Company.
The  Rights become exercisable in certain limited circumstances involving
a  potential  business combination transaction of  the  Company  and  are
initially  exercisable at a price of $200 per share.   Following  certain
other  events  after  the  Rights  have become  exercisable,  each  Right
entitles its holder to purchase for $200 an amount of common stock of the
Company, or, in certain circumstances, securities of the acquiror, having
a then-current market value of two times the exercise price of the Right.
The  Rights  are  redeemable and may be amended at the  Company's  option
before  they become exercisable.  Until a Right is exercised, the  holder
of  a Right, as such, has no rights as a shareholder of the Company.  The
Rights expire on April 19, 1999.

Stock Option Plans
The  Company has in effect a 1990 Stock Option Plan (the "1990 Plan") and
a 1987 Executive Long Term Stock Option Plan (the "1987 Plan").  The 1981
Stock  Option  Plan terminated in October 1990.  Options  granted  before
that date remain outstanding in accordance with their terms.  Options may
be  granted  under  the  1990 Plan to employees, including  officers  and
directors who are
                                        
                                       32



employees, at not less than the fair market value on the date  of  grant.
These  options generally become exercisable over a period of three years,
based  on continued employment, and generally expire ten years after  the
grant  date.   The  1990  Plan permits the granting  of  incentive  stock
options, nonstatutory stock options, and stock appreciation rights.

The  1987  Plan permits the granting of nonstatutory options  to  certain
officers of the Company to purchase Apple common stock at prices not less
than 75% of the fair market value on the date of grant. Options under the
1987  Plan are generally not exercisable for 18 months after the date  of
grant,  and  then become exercisable at varying rates over the subsequent
seven years, based on continued service to the Company.

In  July  1995, the Board of Directors adopted an amendment to  the  1990
Plan  to  increase  the number of shares reserved  for  issuance  by  8.6
million  shares, subject to shareholder approval at the Company's  Annual
Meeting  of  Shareholders scheduled for January 1996.  Concurrently,  the
Board  of Directors also resolved to terminate the 1987 Plan and transfer
all unused shares remaining under the 1987 Plan to the 1990 Plan, subject
to shareholder approval of the aforementioned amendment to the 1990 Plan.

Summarized information regarding the Company's stock option plans as of
September 29, 1995, is as follows:

Restricted Stock Plan
On  April 1, 1993, the Company's Board of Directors approved a Restricted
Stock  Plan  for  officers  of  the Company  (the  "RSP"),  which  became
effective  July  1,  1993.   The  RSP was subsequently  ratified  by  the
shareholders  on  January 26, 1994.  The RSP is designed  to  provide  an
incentive for officers to continue to own shares of the Company's  common
stock  acquired upon exercise of options under any of the Company's Stock
Option  Plans,  thus more closely aligning officers' financial  interests
with  those  of  the  shareholders.  The RSP provides that  officers  who
exercise stock options and continue to hold the exercised shares  for  at
least three years will receive up to three awards of shares of restricted
stock.   Each such award is for one-third the number of shares  held  for
the  requisite  retention period.  Each restricted  stock  award  granted
pursuant  to  the plan becomes fully vested three years after  the  grant
date, provided that the officer maintains continuous employment with  the
Company and that other vesting requirements are met.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The  Company  has  an employee stock purchase plan (the "Purchase  Plan")
under which substantially all employees may purchase common stock through
payroll  deductions  at a price equal to 85% of the  lower  of  the  fair
market  values as of the beginning or end of the offering period.   Stock
purchases  under  the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of  an  employee's
compensation,  up to a maximum of $25,000 in any calendar  year.   As  of
September 29, 1995, approximately 18,000 shares were reserved for  future
issuance  under the Purchase Plan.   In June 1995, the Board of Directors
adopted  an  amendment  to the Purchase Plan to increase  the  number  of
shares  reserved for issuance by 3 million shares, subject to shareholder
approval  at  the Company's Annual Meeting of Shareholders scheduled  for
January 1996.

Stock Repurchase Programs
In November 1992, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to
10  million shares of the Company's common stock in the open market.   No
shares  were  repurchased under this authorization in 1995  or  in  1994;
approximately   3.4   million   shares  were   repurchased   under   this
authorization  in  1993.   In  September 1990,  the  Board  of  Directors
authorized  the  purchase  of up to 10 million shares  of  the  Company's
common  stock  in the open market.  During 1993, the Company  repurchased
the  remaining  shares under this authorization, which  approximated  1.6
million shares.

Employee Savings Plan

The  Company  has  an  employee savings plan (the  "Savings  Plan")  that
qualifies  as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k)  of  the
Internal  Revenue  Code.   Under  the Savings  Plan,  participating  U.S.
employees  may  defer  a  portion of their pretax  earnings,  up  to  the
Internal  Revenue Service annual contribution limit ($9,240 for  calendar
year  1995).  Effective October 1, 1995, the Company matches 50% to  100%
of each employee's contributions, depending on length of service, up to a
maximum  6%  of the employee's earnings.  Prior to October 1,  1995,  the
Company matched 30% to 70% of each employee's contributions, depending on
length  of  service, up to a maximum 6% of the employee's earnings.   The
Company's  matching contributions to the Savings Plan were  approximately
$14.6  million, $10.7 million, and $11.1 million in 1995, 1994, and 1993,
respectively.

Preferred Stock

Five  million shares of preferred stock have been authorized for issuance
in  one or more series.  The Board of Directors is authorized to fix  the
number  and  designation of any such series and to determine the  rights,
preferences,  privileges, and restrictions granted to or imposed  on  any
such series.

Commitments and Contingencies

Lease Commitments

The  Company  leases various facilities and equipment under noncancelable
operating lease arrangements.  The major facilities leases are for  terms
of 5 to 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of up to
5  additional  years.   Rent  expense  under  all  operating  leases  was
approximately $127 million, $122 million, and $170 million in 1995, 1994,
and  1993,  respectively.   Future minimum  lease  payments  under  these
noncancelable  operating leases having remaining terms in excess  of  one
year as of September 29, 1995, are as follows:

Litigation

Apple v. Microsoft Corporation and Hewlett-Packard Company
In  March 1988, the Company filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the
Northern   District   of  California  (the  "Court")  against   Microsoft
Corporation  ("Microsoft") and Hewlett-Packard  Company  ("HP")  alleging
that  their  Microsoft Windows and HP NewWave computer programs  infringe
the  Company's  audiovisual  copyrights  protecting  the  Macintosh  user
interface.  On August 24, 1993, the district court entered final judgment
for Microsoft and HP, dismissing the Company's action.

On  September 21, 1993, the Court denied defendants' motions for an award
of  full  defense costs and attorneys' fees under 17 U.S.C. Section  505,
but  allowed  defendants to renew their motions should the Supreme  Court
alter the standard for the award of attorneys' fees in copyright cases in
the case of Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., 114 S. Ct. 1023 (1994).
            ------------------------

On September 20, 1993, the Company appealed the case to the U.S. Court of
Appeals  for  the  Ninth Circuit.  On September 24, 1994,  the  Court  of
Appeals issued its decision affirming the district court judgment on  the
merits but remanding the case on the issue of attorneys' fees in light of
the  Fogerty   decision.   The Company filed a petition  for  a  writ  of
     -------                                                  -----------
certiorari  in  the Supreme Court of the United States  on  December  19,
- ----------
1994.

The Company's petition for a writ of certiorari was denied by the Supreme
                             ------------------
Court  of  the  United  States on February 21,  1995.   Accordingly,  the
decision  of the appellate court affirming the dismissal of the Company's
copyright  infringement case against Microsoft and HP is now final.   The
requests  of  Microsoft and HP for attorneys' fees have been resolved  by
settlement  agreements.   Accordingly,  the  matter  has  been   entirely
resolved.

year's presentation.  Net sales to unaffiliated customers is based on the
location  of  the  customers.   Transfers between  geographic  areas  are
recorded at amounts generally above cost and in accordance with the rules
and  regulations of the respective governing tax authorities.   Operating
income  (loss)  by  geographic area consists  of  total  net  sales  less
operating  expenses,  and  does  not include  an  allocation  of  general
corporate  expenses.  The restructuring charge recorded in 1993  and  the
related  adjustments  recorded  in 1995 and  1994  are  included  in  the
calculation  of  operating  income  (loss)  for  each  geographic   area.
Identifiable  assets of geographic areas are those  assets  used  in  the
Company's  operations in each area.  Corporate assets  include  cash  and
cash equivalents, joint venture investments, and short-term investments.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
 


Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  


Apple
Computer, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) designs, manufactures and markets personal computers and related software, services, peripherals and networking solutions. The Company also
designs, develops and markets a line of portable digital music players along with related accessories and services including the online distribution of third-party music and audio books. The Company
sells its products worldwide through its online stores, its own retail stores, its direct sales force and third-party wholesalers, resellers and value added resellers. In addition to its own hardware,
software and peripheral products, the Company sells a variety of third-party hardware and software products through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to education, consumer, creative
professional, business and government customers. 


Basis of Presentation and Preparation  


The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these
consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior year amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 


Typically,
the Company's fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of September. Fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002 were each 52-week years. However, approximately every six years, the Company
reports a 53-week fiscal year to align its fiscal quarters with calendar quarters by adding a week to its first fiscal quarter. The Company expects to add this additional week in its first
fiscal quarter of 2006. All information presented herein is based on the Company's fiscal calendar. 


Financial Instruments  


Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments  


All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. Highly liquid investments with maturities
greater than three months are classified as short-term investments. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments in debt and marketable equity securities at the
time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date. The Company's debt and marketable equity securities have been classified and accounted for as
available-for-sale. These securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of shareholders' equity. The cost of
securities sold is based upon the specific identification method. 


Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity  


On May 15, 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 150, 
 
Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of
Both Liabilities and Equity
. SFAS No. 150 requires issuers to classify as
liabilities (or assets in some circumstances) certain freestanding financial instruments that embody obligations for the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The Company
adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 150 on June 29, 2003, which resulted in a favorable cumulative-effect type adjustment of approximately $3 million. This adjustment related to a
forward purchase agreement that allowed the Company to acquire 1.5 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $16.64 per share for a total cost of $25.5 million. The
Company settled this forward purchase agreement in August 2003, which resulted in an additional gain of 


64








 


approximately
$6 million representing the increase in fair value of the agreement from June 29, 2003 through the settlement date. 


Derivative Financial Instruments  


The Company accounts for its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair
value through income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets,
liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. 


For
derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges, the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported
as a component of other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. To receive hedge
accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure
to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that are designated as fair value hedges, the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the
hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current period. The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as an economic
hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure of the net investment in a foreign operation is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For forward contracts
designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or
losses related to this component are recognized in current earnings. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in the current
period. 


In
accordance with SFAS No. 133, hedges related to probable but not firmly committed transactions of an anticipatory nature are designated and documented at hedge inception as cash flow hedges
and evaluated for hedge effectiveness quarterly. For foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges, hedge effectiveness is measured based on changes in the fair value of the
contract attributable to changes in the forward exchange rate. Changes in the expected future cash flows on the forecasted hedged transaction and changes in the fair value of the forward hedge are
both measured from the contract rate to the forward exchange rate associated with the forward contract's maturity date. For currency option contracts, hedge effectiveness is assessed by comparing the
present value of the cumulative change in expected future cash flows on the hedged transaction to changes in expected cash flow of the option hedge at maturity. The net gains or losses on derivative
instruments qualifying as cash flow hedges are reported as components of other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which
the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any hedge ineffectiveness is recognized in current earnings in other income and expense. For interest rate swap agreements qualifying as fair value hedges, the
Company assumes no ineffectiveness because these swaps meet the criteria for accounting under the short-cut method. 


The
Company may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the translation and economic exposure of a net investment position in a foreign subsidiary. For such contracts, hedge
effectiveness is measured based on changes in the fair value of the contract attributable to changes in the spot exchange rate. The effective portion of the net gain or loss on a derivative instrument
designated as a hedge of the net investment position in a foreign subsidiary is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency 


65








 




translation
adjustment. Any residual changes in fair value of the forward contract, including changes in fair value based on the differential between the spot and forward exchange rates, are
recognized in current earnings in other income and expense. 


Inventories  


Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. If the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are
made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. 


Property, Plant, and Equipment  


Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which
are 30 years for buildings, from 2 to 5 years for equipment, and the shorter of lease terms or 10 years for leasehold improvements. The Company capitalizes eligible costs to
acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 5 years. 


Asset Retirement Obligations  


On September 29, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 143, 
Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations
, which
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. The standard applies to
legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. SFAS No. 143
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of
the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. All of the Company's existing asset retirement
obligations are
associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. The Company estimated that as of September 29, 2002, gross expected
future cash flows of $9.5 million would be required to fulfill these obligations. 


As
of the date of adoption, the Company recorded a $6 million long-term asset retirement liability and a corresponding increase in leasehold improvements. This amount represents the
present value of expected future cash flows associated with returning certain of the Company's leased properties to original condition. The difference between the gross expected future cash flow of
$9.5 million and its present value of $6 million at September 29, 2002, is being accreted over the life of the related leases as an operating expense. Net of the related income
tax effect of approximately $1 million, adoption of SFAS No. 143 resulted in an unfavorable cumulative-effect type adjustment to net income during the first quarter of 2003 of
approximately $2 million. This adjustment represents cumulative depreciation and accretion that would have been recognized through the date of adoption of SFAS No. 143 had the statement
been applied to the Company's existing asset retirement obligations at the time they were initially incurred.

Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets  


The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to
generate. If property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the
assets exceeds its fair market value. For the three years ended September 25, 2004, September 27, 2003, and September 28, 2002 the Company had no material impairment of its
long-lived assets, except for the impairment of certain assets in connection with the restructuring actions described in Note 5. 


The
Company adopted SFAS No. 142, 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
, in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. SFAS No. 142 requires that
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that they may be impaired. Prior to fiscal 2002, goodwill was amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life. The Company completed its transitional
goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2001, and its annual goodwill impairment tests on August 30 of each year thereafter and found no impairment. The Company established reporting
units based on its current reporting structure. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit. 


SFAS
No. 142 also requires that intangible assets with definite lives be amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, 
 
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of
. The Company is currently
amortizing its acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods ranging from 3 to 10 years. 


Foreign Currency Translation  


The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its international non-U.S. functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at
the end of each period. Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are credited
or charged to foreign currency translation included in "accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" in shareholders' equity. The Company's foreign manufacturing subsidiaries and certain other
international subsidiaries that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and inventories,
property, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. Gains and 


67








 


losses
from these translations were insignificant and have been included in the Company's results of operations. 


Revenue Recognition  


Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of products (hardware, software, and peripherals), and extended warranty and support contracts. The Company recognizes
revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards, including Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97-2, 
Software Revenue Recognition
, as
amended, and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, 
Revenue Recognition
. 


The
Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered
delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Company's product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped.
For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company
legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed to not be, fixed or
determinable, revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable. 


Revenue
from extended warranty and support contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the warranty and support periods. These contracts typically include extended phone support, certain
repairs, web-based support resources, diagnostic tools, and extend the Company's one-year basic limited parts and labor warranty. 


The
Company sells software and peripheral products obtained from other companies. The Company establishes its own pricing and retains related inventory risk, is the primary obligor in sales
transactions with its customers, and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue for the sale of products obtained from other companies at
the gross amount billed. 


Revenue
on arrangements that include multiple elements such as hardware, software, and services is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element, which is generally
determined by vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE). Allocated revenue for each element is recognized when revenue recognition criteria have been met for each element. VSOE is determined based on
the price charged when each element is sold separately. 


The
Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end user rebates, and other sales programs
and volume-based incentives. The estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue in the period the Company has sold the product and committed to a plan. The Company also records
reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company's historical experience. 


Generally,
the Company does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales or the sale of extended warranty and support contracts. However, a
limited number of the Company's software products are available with maintenance agreements that grant customers rights to unspecified future upgrades over the maintenance term on a when and if
available basis. Revenue associated with such maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term.

Shipping Costs  


The Company's shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales for all periods presented. 


Warranty Expense  


The Company provides currently for the estimated cost for product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. 


Research and Development  


Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning
when a product's technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers pursuant to SFAS No. 86, 
Computer
Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed
. In most instances, the Company's products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. Therefore,
costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally all software development costs have been expensed. 


During
the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company incurred substantial development costs associated with the development of Mac OS X version 10.4 (code-named "Tiger"), which enhances the
features and functionality of the previous version of Mac OS X, subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility as evidenced by public demonstration in August 2004 and subsequent release
of a developer beta version of the product, both of which were prior to the planned release of the final version of the product in the first half of calendar year 2005. Therefore, during the fourth
quarter of 2004, the Company capitalized approximately $4.5 million of costs associated with development of Tiger. Amortization of this asset will begin when Tiger begins shipping and will be
recognized straight-line over a 3 year estimated useful life. 


During
the second quarter of 2004, the Company incurred substantial development costs associated with FileMaker Pro 7 subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility as evidenced by public
demonstration and release of a developer beta version, and prior to the release of the final version of the product in March 2004. Therefore, during the second quarter of 2004, the Company
capitalized approximately $2.3 million of costs associated with the development of FileMaker Pro 7. In accordance with SFAS No. 86, amortization of this asset began in March 2004
when FileMaker Pro 7 was shipped and is being recognized on a straight-line basis over a 3 year estimated useful life. 


During
the third and fourth quarters of 2003, the Company incurred substantial development costs associated with the development of Mac OS X version 10.3 (code-named "Panther"), subsequent
to achievement of technological feasibility as evidenced by public demonstration and release of a developer beta in June 2003, and prior to release of the final version of the product in the
first quarter of 2004. Therefore, during 2003 the Company capitalized approximately $14.7 million of development costs associated with the development of Panther. Amortization of this asset
began in the first quarter of 2004 when Panther was shipped and is being recognized on a straight-line basis in accordance with SFAS No. 86 over a 3 year estimated useful
life. 


During
the third and fourth quarters of 2002, the Company incurred substantial development costs associated with the development of Mac OS X version 10.2 (code-named "Jaguar") subsequent
to achievement of technological feasibility as evidenced by public demonstration and release of a developer beta in May 2002, and prior to release of the final version of the product in the
fourth quarter of 2002. As such, the Company capitalized approximately $13.3 million of development costs associated with development of Jaguar. Amortization of this asset began in the fourth
quarter of 2002 when Jaguar was 


69








 




shipped
and is being recognized on a straight-line basis in accordance with SFAS No. 86 over a 3 year estimated useful life. In addition, during 2002, the Company also began
capitalizing certain costs related to development of its new PowerSchool enterprise student information system. Capitalization of approximately $6 million began upon achievement of
technological feasibility in the first quarter of 2002. The final version of the enterprise student information system was released in July 2002. 


Total
amortization related to capitalized software development costs was $10.7 million, $5.8 million, and $1.2 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 


Advertising Costs  


Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $206 million, $193 million, and $209 million for 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. 


Restructuring Charges  


In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, 
Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
. SFAS
No. 146 supersedes Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94-3, 
Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs
To Exit an Activity (Including Certain Costs Associated with a Restructuring)
 and requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be
recognized when the liability is incurred, as opposed to when management commits to an exit plan. SFAS No. 146 also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at
fair value. This Statement was effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The provisions of SFAS No. 146 were required to be applied prospectively after
the adoption date to newly initiated exit activities. 


Stock-Based Compensation  


The Company measures compensation expense for its employee stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB)
Opinion No. 25, 
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
 The Company applies the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123, 
 
Accounting for Stock-based
Compensation
, as amended by SFAS No. 148
, Accounting for Stock-based
CompensationTransition and Disclosure
 as if the fair value-based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense. The Company has elected to follow APB
Opinion No. 25 because, as discussed below, the alternative fair value accounting provided for under SFAS No. 123 requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use
in valuing employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares. Under APB Opinion No. 25, when the exercise price of the Company's employee stock options equals the market price of
the underlying stock on the date of the grant, no compensation expense is recognized. 


As
required under SFAS No. 123, the pro forma effects of stock-based compensation on net income and earnings per common share for employee stock options granted and employee stock purchase plan
share purchases have been estimated at the date of grant and beginning of the period, respectively, using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated
fair value of the options and shares is amortized to pro forma net income (loss) over the options' vesting period and the shares' plan period. 


The
Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of freely traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option
valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected life of options and the Company's expected stock price volatility. Because the Company's employee stock
options and employee 


70








 




stock
purchase plan shares have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair
value estimate, in management's opinion, the existing models do not provide a reliable measure of the fair value of the Company's employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares. 


For
purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options and shares is amortized to pro forma net income (loss) over the options' vesting period and the shares' plan period. The
Company's pro forma information for each of the last three fiscal years follows (in millions, except per share amounts):

Earnings Per Common Share  


Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period
increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of common stock had been issued. The dilutive effect of
outstanding options, restricted stock and restricted stock units is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in
the fair market value of the Company's common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from outstanding options, restricted stock and restricted stock units. Additionally, the exercise of
employee stock options and the vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units can result in a greater dilutive effect on earnings per share.

shares of common stock for the years ended September 25, 2004, September 27, 2003, and September 28, 2002, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per
share for these periods because their effect would have been antidilutive. 


Comprehensive Income  


Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under
generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders' equity but are excluded from net income. The Company's other comprehensive income is comprised of foreign currency
translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as
available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges. 


Segment Information  


The Company reports segment information based on the "management" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions
and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments. Information about the Company's products, major customers, and geographic areas on a company-wide basis is
also disclosed.

The
Company's short-term investment portfolio consists of investments in U.S. Treasury and Agency securities, U.S. corporate securities, and foreign securities. The Company's U.S.
corporate securities consist primarily of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, time deposits and corporate debt securities. Foreign securities consist primarily of foreign commercial paper,
certificates of deposit and time deposits with foreign institutions, most of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company had net unrealized losses totaling $4 million on its investment
portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities less than 1 year as of September 25, 2004 and net unrealized gains of $1 million on its investment portfolio,
primarily related to investments with stated maturities greater than 1 year, as of September 27, 2003. The Company occasionally sells short-term investments prior to their
stated maturities. As a result of such sales, the Company recognized net gains before taxes of $1 million in 2004, $21 million in 2003 and $7 million in 2002. These net gains were
included in interest and other income, net. 


As
of September 25, 2004, approximately $180 million of the Company's short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remaining
short-term investments as of September 25, 2004 had maturities of 3 to 12 months. As of September 27, 2003, approximately $629 million of the Company's
short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remaining short-term investments as of September 27, 2003 had maturities of 3 to
12 months.

Market
values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. The declines in value of these investments is primarily related to changes in interest rates and are considered
to be temporary in nature. Investments are reviewed periodically to identify possible impairment. When evaluating the investments, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to
which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the investee, and the Company's ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for
anticipated recovery in market value. 


Accounts Receivable  


Trade Receivables  


The Company distributes its products through third-party resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and commercial customers. The Company generally does not require
collateral from its customers. However, when possible the Company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe and Asia
and by arranging with third-party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the Company's direct customers. These credit financing arrangements are
directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.
However, considerable trade
receivables that are not covered by collateral, third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Company's distribution and retail channel partners. No customer
accounted for more than 10% of trade receivables as of September 25, 2004. Trade receivables from a single customer, Ingram Micro, Inc., accounted for approximately 10.3% of net accounts
receivable as of September 27, 2003.

Vendor Non-Trade Receivables  


The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors
who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these raw material components directly from suppliers. These non-trade
receivables, which are included in the consolidated balance sheets in other current assets, totaled $276 million and $184 million as of September 25, 2004 and September 27,
2003, respectively. The Company does not recognize any profits on these sales or reflect the sale of these components in its net sales. 


Inventory Prepayment  


In April 2002, the Company made a $100 million prepayment to an Asian supplier for the purchase of components over the following nine months. In return for this
deposit, the supplier agreed to supply the Company with a specified level of components during the three consecutive fiscal quarters ended December 28, 2002. During the first six months of
2003, the remaining $53 million of the deposit balance was fully utilized for the purchase of components. The deposit was unsecured and had no stated interest component. The Company imputed an
amount to cost of sales and interest income during each period the deposit was outstanding at a 3.25% interest rate to reflect the economics of this transaction. 


Derivative Financial Instruments  


The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. Foreign currency forward and option contracts are used to
offset the foreign exchange risk on certain existing assets and liabilities and to hedge the foreign exchange risk on expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales. From
time to time, the Company enters into interest rate derivative agreements to modify the interest rate profile of certain investments and debt. The Company's accounting policies for these instruments
are based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. 


The
following table shows the notional principal, net fair value, and credit risk amounts of the Company's foreign currency instruments as of September 25, 2004 and September 27, 2003

The
notional principal amounts for derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of year-end, and do not represent the amount of the Company's
exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amount shown in the table above represents the Company's gross exposure to 


75








 




potential
accounting loss on these transactions if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency exchange rates at each
respective date. The Company's exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a function of currency exchange rates. 


The
estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models using prevailing financial market information as of September 25, 2004 and September 27, 2003. In
certain instances where judgment is required in estimating fair value, price quotes were obtained from several of the Company's counterparty financial institutions. Although the table above reflects
the notional principal, fair value, and credit risk amounts of the Company's foreign exchange instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that
the foreign exchange instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures,
will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. 


Foreign Exchange Risk Management  


The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risk associated with existing assets
and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions and forecasted future cash flows. Generally, the Company's practice is to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction
exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, or limited availability of
appropriate hedging instruments. 


To
protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company's U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenues, and the
Company's non-U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries selling in local currencies hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries' functional currency.
Other comprehensive income associated with hedges of foreign currency revenues is recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related sales are recognized, and other comprehensive
income related to inventory purchases is recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Typically, the Company hedges portions of its forecasted
foreign currency exposure associated with revenues and inventory purchases over a time horizon of 3 to 9 months. 


Derivative
instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be dedesignated as hedges when it is probable that the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period
or within a subsequent 2 month time period. Deferred gains and losses in other comprehensive income associated with such derivative instruments are immediately reclassified into earnings in
other income and expense. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are also reflected in current earnings unless they are redesignated as hedges of other transactions.
During 2004, the Company recorded net losses of $2.8 million in other income and expense related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges due to changes in the
Company's forecast of future net sales and cost of sales and due to prevailing market conditions. No net gains, or losses, of a similar nature were recorded in 2003. During 2002, the Company recorded
net gains of $2.5 million in other income and expense related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges due to changes in the Company's forecast of future net sales and
cost of sales and due to prevailing market conditions. As of September 25, 2004, the Company had a net deferred loss associated with cash flow hedges of approximately $4.4 million, net
of taxes, substantially all of which is expected to be reclassified to earnings by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2005. 


76








 




The
Company may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the translation and economic exposure of a net investment position in a foreign subsidiary. The Company may also enter into
foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities in non-functional
currencies. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in current earnings in other income and expense as offsets to the changes in the fair value of the related assets or
liabilities. Due to market movements, changes in option time value can lead to increased volatility in other income and expense. 


Interest Rate Risk Management  


From time to time, the Company historically entered into interest rate derivative transactions with financial institutions in order to better match the Company's
floating-rate interest income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on any outstanding long-term debt,
and/or to
diversify a portion of the Company's exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. 


In
prior years, the Company had entered into interest rate debt swaps with financial institutions in order to better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on cash equivalents
and short term investments with its fixed rate interest expense on its long term debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the Company's exposure away from fluctuations in short term U.S. interest rates.
The interest rate swaps required the Company to pay a floating interest rate based on the three- or six-month U.S. dollar LIBOR and receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of
the underlying notional amounts. These swaps effectively converted the Company's fixed-rate 10-year debt to floating-rate debt. Due to prevailing market interest
rates, during 2001 and 2002 the Company entered into and then subsequently closed out interest rate debt swap positions realizing gains of $23 million which were deferred over the remaining
life of the debt. 


As
of September 25, 2004 and September 27, 2003, the Company had no interest rate derivatives outstanding. 


Debt  


In February 2004, the Company retired $300 million of debt outstanding in the form of 6.5% unsecured notes. The notes were originally issued in 1994 and were sold
at 99.9925% of par for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. As of September 27, 2003, the carrying amount of these notes, including unamortized deferred gains associated with closed debt
interest rate swaps, was $304 million, respectively, while the fair value was $302 million. The fair value of the notes was based on their listed market values as of September 27,
2003. 


Non-Current Debt and Equity Investments and Related Gains and Losses  


The Company has held significant investments in ARM Holdings plc (ARM), Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai) and EarthLink Network, Inc. (EarthLink). These
investments have been reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as long term assets within other assets and have been categorized as available-for-sale requiring that they
be carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. All realized gains on the sale of these
investments have been included in other income and expense. In fiscal 2004, the Company sold all of its remaining non-current investments in public companies. 


77








 


EarthLink  


In January 2000, the Company invested $200 million in EarthLink, an Internet service provider (ISP). The investment was in EarthLink's Series C Convertible
Preferred Stock, which was convertible by the Company after January 4, 2001, into approximately 7.1 million shares of EarthLink common stock. Concurrent with this investment, EarthLink
and the Company entered into a multi-year agreement to deliver ISP service to Macintosh users in the U.S. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company profits from each new Macintosh
customer that subscribes to EarthLink's ISP service for a specified period of time, and EarthLink is the default ISP in the Company's Internet Setup Software included with all Macintosh computers sold
in the U.S. 


During
the first quarter of 2003, the Company sold 2,580,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds of approximately $13.7 million, an amount that approximated the Company's carrying value
of the shares. During the third quarter of 2003, the Company sold all of its remaining holdings in EarthLink, consisting of 3,960,000 shares of stock for net proceeds of approximately
$23 million, and a gain before taxes of $2 million. 


During
the first quarter of 2002, the Company sold 117,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds of $2 million and a gain before taxes of $223,000. No sales of EarthLink were made in any
of the subsequent quarters of fiscal 2002. However, during the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company determined that the then current decline in the fair value of its investment in EarthLink was
other-than-temporary. As a result, the Company recognized a $44 million charge to earnings to write-down the basis of its investment in EarthLink to
$35 million. This charge was included in gains (losses) on non-current investments, net. As of September 28, 2002, the Company held 6.5 million shares of EarthLink
stock valued at $35 million. 


Akamai  


In June 1999, the Company invested $12.5 million in Akamai, a global Internet content delivery service. The investment was in the form of convertible preferred
stock that converted into 4.1 million shares of Akamai common stock (adjusted for subsequent stock splits) at the time of Akamai's initial public offering in October 1999. Beginning in
the first quarter of 2000, the Company categorized its shares in Akamai as available-for-sale. 


During
2004, the Company sold its remaining 986,000 shares of Akamai stock. The transaction generated proceeds of approximately $5 million and a gain before taxes of approximately
$4 million. 


During
the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company sold 1,875,000 shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of $9 million and a gain before taxes of $8 million. As of September 27,
2003, the Company's remaining investment in Akamai consisted of 986,000 shares of Akamai stock valued at $5 million. 


During
the first quarter of 2002, the Company sold 250,000 shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of $2 million and a gain before taxes of $710,000. No sales of Akamai were made in any of the
subsequent quarters of fiscal 2002. However, during the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company determined the decline in the fair value of its investment in Akamai was
other-than-temporary. As a result, the Company recognized a $6 million charge to earnings to write-down the basis of its investment in Akamai to
$3 million. This charge was included in gains (losses) on non-current investments, net. 


78










 
 


ARM  


ARM is a publicly held company in the U.K. involved in the design and licensing of high performance microprocessors and related technology. 


During
the third quarter of 2003, the Company sold all of its remaining holdings in ARM stock, consisting of 278,000 shares for net proceeds of approximately $295,000, and a gain before taxes of
$270,000. 


During
the first quarter of 2002, the Company sold 4.7 million shares of ARM stock for both net proceeds and a gain before taxes of $21 million. No sales of ARM were made in any of the
subsequent quarters of fiscal 2002. 


Other Strategic Investments  


The Company has made additional minority debt and equity investments in several privately held technology companies, which were reflected in the consolidated balance sheets in
other assets. These investments were inherently risky because the products and/or markets of these companies were typically not fully developed. During 2002, the Company determined the decline in fair
value of certain of these investments was other-than-temporary and, accordingly, recognized a charge to earnings of $15 million. These charges were included in gains
(losses) on non-current investments, net. As of September 25, 2004, the Company had $1.4 million of equity investments reflected in its consolidated balance sheet. As of
September 27, 2003, the Company had no private debt or equity investments reflected in its consolidated balance sheet.

Note 4Acquisitions  


Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  


The Company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods ranging from 3 to 10 years. The Company ceased amortization of
goodwill at the beginning of fiscal 2002 when it adopted SFAS No. 142.

(a)
Accumulated
amortization related to goodwill of $55 million arising prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 142 has been reflected in the gross carrying amount of goodwill as
of September 25, 2004 and September 27, 2003. 


During
the third quarter of 2004, the Company recorded an adjustment of approximately $5 million to goodwill related to the acquisition of PowerSchool, Inc (PowerSchool) in fiscal 2001. This
reduction of goodwill included the cancellation of 79,167 shares of Apple common stock, valued at approximately $2 million, that were previously held in escrow and were refunded upon resolution
of certain matters arising out of the acquisition of PowerSchool. This adjustment also included approximately $3 million to adjust the original estimates of the pre-acquisition
PowerSchool restructuring liability to actual costs incurred.

Acquisition of Emagic GmbH  


During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company acquired Emagic GmbH (Emagic), a provider of professional software solutions for computer based music production, for
approximately $30 million in cash; $26 million of which was paid immediately upon closing of the deal and $4 million of which was held-back for future payment
contingent on continued employment by certain employees that would be allocated to future compensation expense in the appropriate periods over the following 3 years. During fiscal 2003,
contingent consideration totaling $1.3 million was paid. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase. The portion of the purchase price allocated to purchased in-process
research and development (IPR&D) was expensed immediately, and the portion of the purchase price allocated to acquired technology and to tradename will be amortized over their estimated useful lives
of 3 years. Goodwill associated with the acquisition of Emagic is not subject to amortization pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 142. Total consideration was allocated as follows (in
millions):

The
amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition, because the technological feasibility of products under development had not been established and no alternative
future uses existed. The IPR&D relates primarily to Emagic's Logic series technology and extensions. At the date of the acquisition, the products under development were between 43%-83%
complete, and it was expected that the remaining work would be completed during the Company's fiscal 2003 at a cost of approximately $415,000. The remaining efforts, which were completed in 2003,
included finalizing user interface design and development, and testing. The fair value of the IPR&D was determined using an income approach, which reflects the projected free cash flows that will be
generated by the IPR&D projects and that are attributable to the acquired technology, and discounting the projected net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 25%. 


Acquisition of certain assets of Zayante, Inc., Prismo Graphics, and Silicon Grail  


During fiscal 2002 the Company acquired certain technology and patent rights of Zayante, Inc., Prismo Graphics, and Silicon Grail Corporation for a total of
$20 million in cash. These transactions have been accounted for as asset acquisitions. The purchase price for these asset acquisitions, except for $1 million identified as contingent
consideration which would be allocated to compensation expense over the following 3 years, has been allocated to acquired technology and would be amortized on a straight-line basis
over 3 years, except for certain assets acquired from Zayante associated with patent royalty streams that would be amortized over 10 years. 


Acquisition of Nothing Real, LLC  


During the second quarter of 2002, the Company acquired certain assets of Nothing Real, LLC (Nothing Real), a privately-held company that develops and markets high
performance tools designed for the digital image creation market. Of the $15 million purchase price, the Company has allocated $7 million to acquired technology, which will be amortized
over its estimated life of 5 years. The remaining $8 million, which has been identified as contingent consideration, rather than recorded as an additional component of 


82








 


the
cost of the acquired assets, would be allocated to future compensation expense in the appropriate periods over the following 3 years. 


Note 5Restructuring Charges  


Fiscal 2004 Restructuring Actions  


The Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $23 million during the year ended September 25, 2004, including approximately $14 million
in severance costs, $5.5 million in asset impairments, and a $3.5 million charge for lease cancellations. Of the $23 million charge, $14.3 million had been spent by the end
of 2004, with the remaining $8.7 million consisting of $5.2 million for employee severance benefits and $3.5 million for lease cancellations. 


During
the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company recognized restructuring expense of $5.5 million. In conjunction with the European workforce reduction during the second quarter of 2004, the
Company vacated a leased sales facility during the fourth quarter of 2004 resulting in a charge of $3.7 million for contract termination and asset impairment costs. The Company also recognized
employee termination costs of $1.8 million related to the elimination of non-essential positions, principally in Europe. In addition, the Company reversed $400,000 of excess
restructuring expense from prior periods related primarily to lower than expected disposal costs on Sacramento manufacturing-related fixed assets. The net cost of the restructuring plans for the
fourth quarter of 2004 was $5.1 million, of which $300,000 had been paid prior to the end of 2004. These actions will result in the termination of 54 positions, 4 of which had been terminated
prior to the end of 2004. 


During
the third quarter of 2004, the Company finalized restructuring plans related to closing Company-owned manufacturing activities in Sacramento. In addition, the Company's management approved
restructuring plans related to certain headcount reductions primarily for various sales and marketing activities principally in the U.S. Total cost of the restructuring plan for the third quarter of
2004 was $7.9 million, of which $7.2 million had been paid prior to the end of 2004. These actions will result in the termination of 83 positions, 77 of which had been terminated prior
to the end of 2004. 


The
closing of manufacturing operations in Sacramento resulted in the elimination of 67 positions for a severance cost of $1.9 million and write-off of $5.3 million in
manufacturing-related fixed assets whose use ceased during the third quarter of 2004. Termination of sales and marketing activities, principally in the U.S., resulted in severance of
$0.7 million for the elimination of 16 positions. 


During
the second quarter of 2004, the Company's management approved restructuring plans related to the termination of Company-owned manufacturing activities in Sacramento and headcount reductions
related primarily to various sales and marketing activities in the U.S. and Europe. Total cost of the actions was $9.6 million for the termination of 348 positions. As of the end of the fourth
quarter of 2004, $6.8 million had been spent and 310 positions had been eliminated related to these actions.

Fiscal 2003 Restructuring Actions  


The Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $26.8 million during the year ended September 27, 2003, including approximately
$7.4 million in severance costs, a $5.0 million charge to write-off deferred compensation, $7.1 million in asset impairments and a $7.3 million charge for lease
cancellations. Of the $26.8 million charge, all had been spent by the end of 2004, except for approximately $3.0 million related to operating lease costs on abandoned facilities. During
the third quarter of 2003, approximately $500,000 of the amount originally accrued for lease cancellations was determined to be in excess due to the sublease of a property sooner than originally
estimated and a shortfall of approximately $500,000 was identified in the severance accrual due to higher than expected severance costs related to the closure of the Company's Singapore manufacturing
operations. These adjustments had no net effect on reported operating expense. 


During
the second quarter of 2003, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions that resulted in recognition of a total restructuring charge of $2.8 million, including
$2.4 million in severance costs and $400,000 for asset write-offs and lease payments on an abandoned facility. Actions taken in the second quarter were for the most part
supplemental to actions initiated in the prior two quarters and focused on further headcount reductions in various sales and marketing functions in the Company's Americas and Europe operating segments
and further reductions associated with PowerSchool-related activities in the Americas operating segment, including an accrual for asset write-offs and lease payments on an abandoned
facility. The second quarter actions resulted in the termination of 93 employees. 


During
the first quarter of 2003, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of $24 million that resulted in the termination of manufacturing
operations at the Company-owned facility in Singapore, further reductions in headcount resulting from the shift in PowerSchool product strategy that took place at the end of fiscal 2002, and
termination of various sales and marketing activities in the U.S. and Europe. These restructuring actions resulted in the elimination of 260 positions worldwide. 


Closure
of the Company's Singapore manufacturing operations resulted in severance costs of $1.8 million and costs of $6.7 million to write-off manufacturing related fixed
assets, whose use ceased during the first quarter. PowerSchool related costs included severance of approximately $550,000 and recognition of $5 million of previously deferred stock compensation
that arose when PowerSchool was acquired by the Company in 2001 related to certain PowerSchool employee stockholders who were terminated in the first quarter of 2003. Termination of sales and
marketing activities and employees, principally in the U.S. and Europe, resulted in severance costs of $2.8 million and accrual of costs associated with operating leases on 


84








 




closed
facilities of $6.7 million. The total net restructuring charge of $23 million recognized during the first quarter of 2003 also reflects the reversal of $600,000 of unused
restructuring accrual originally made during the first quarter of 2002.

Fiscal 2002 Restructuring Actions  


During fiscal 2002, the Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $30 million related to actions intended to eliminate certain activities and better
align the Company's operating expenses with existing general economic conditions and to partially offset the cost of continuing investments in new product development and investments in the Company's
Retail operating segment. 


During
the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of approximately $6 million designed to reduce headcount costs in
corporate operations and sales and to adjust its PowerSchool product strategy. These restructuring actions resulted in the elimination of approximately 180 positions worldwide at a cost of
$1.8 million, all of which were eliminated by September 27, 2003. Eliminated positions were primarily in corporate operations, sales, and PowerSchool related research and development in
the Americas operating segment. The shift in product strategy at PowerSchool included discontinuing development and marketing of PowerSchool's PSE product. This shift resulted in the impairment of
previously capitalized development costs associated with the PSE product in the amount of $4.5 million. 


During
the first quarter of 2002, the Company's management approved and initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of approximately $24 million. These restructuring actions resulted in
the elimination of approximately 425 positions worldwide at a cost of $8 million. Positions were eliminated primarily in the Company's operations, information systems, and administrative
functions. In addition, these restructuring actions also included significant changes in the Company's information systems strategy resulting in termination of equipment leases and cancellation of
existing projects and activities. The Company ceased using the assets associated with first quarter 2002 restructuring actions during that same quarter. Related lease and contract cancellation charges
totaled $12 million, and charges for asset impairments totaled $4 million. The first quarter 2002 restructuring actions were primarily related to corporate activity not allocated to
operating segments. During the first quarter of 2003, the Company reversed the remaining unused accrual of $600,000. All amounts associated with the fiscal 2002 restructuring actions had been spent by
the end of fiscal 2003.

The
foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pretax earnings of approximately $384 million, $250 million and $284 million in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. As
of September 25, 2004, approximately $3.2 billion of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based
in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. The Company's consolidated financial statements
fully provide for any related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated, aside from undistributed earnings of certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be indefinitely
reinvested in operations outside the U.S. U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $972 million of such earnings. It is not practicable to determine the income tax
liability that might be incurred if these earnings were to be distributed. 


Deferred
tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits, and the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts
of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected
to be recovered or settled.

As
of September 25, 2004, the Company had operating loss carryforwards for federal tax purposes of approximately $446 million, which expire from 2011 through 2024. A portion of these
carryforwards was acquired from NeXT and other acquisitions, the utilization of which is subject to certain limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The Company also has Federal credit
carryforwards and various state and foreign tax loss and credit carryforwards, the tax effect of which is approximately $132 million and which expire between 2005 and 2024. The remaining
benefits from tax losses and credits do not expire. As of September 25, 2004, a valuation allowance of $30 million was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax
losses that may not be realized. The valuation allowance relates primarily to the operating loss carryforwards acquired from NeXT and other acquisitions. Management believes it is more likely than not
that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to
fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets.

The
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed its field audit of the Company's federal income tax returns for all years prior to 2001 and proposed certain adjustments. Certain of these
adjustments are being contested through the IRS Appeals Office. Substantially all IRS audit issues for these years have been resolved. In addition, the Company is also subject to audits by state,
local, and foreign tax authorities. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be
predicted with certainty. Should any issues addressed in the Company's tax audits be resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its
provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs. 


Note 7Shareholders' Equity  


Restricted Stock Units  


During fiscal 2004, the Company's Board of Directors approved the grant of 2.515 million restricted stock units to selected members of the Company's senior management,
excluding its Chief Executive Officer (CEO). These restricted stock units generally vest in two equal installments on the second and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant. The Company has recorded
the $64.4 million value of these restricted stock units as a component of shareholders' equity and will amortize that amount on a straight-line basis over the 4 year
requisite service period. The value of the restricted stock units was based on the closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. Quarterly amortization will be approximately
$4.0 million, of which approximately $0.5 million will be included in cost of sales; $1.3 million will be included in research and development expense; and the remaining
$2.2 million will be included in selling, general and administrative expense. The restricted stock units have been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share utilizing the
treasury stock method. 


CEO Restricted Stock Award  


On March 19, 2003, the Company entered into an Option Cancellation and Restricted Stock Award Agreement (the Agreement) with Mr. Steven P. Jobs, its CEO. The
Agreement cancelled stock option 


88








 


awards
for the purchase of 27.5 million shares of the Company's common stock previously granted to Mr. Jobs in 2000 and 2001. Mr. Jobs retained options to purchase 60,000 shares
of the Company's common stock granted in August of 1997 in his capacity as a member of the Company's Board of Directors, prior to becoming the Company's CEO. The Agreement replaced the cancelled
options with a restricted stock award of 5 million shares of the Company's common stock. The restricted stock award generally vests three years from date of grant. Vesting of some or all of the
restricted shares will be accelerated in the event Mr. Jobs is terminated without cause, dies, or has his management role reduced following a change in control of the Company. 


The
Company has recorded the value of the restricted stock award of $74.75 million as a component of shareholders' equity and is amortizing that amount on a straight-line basis over
the 3 year service period. The value of the restricted stock award was based on the closing market price of the Company's common stock of $14.95 on the date of the award. Amortization expense
for this award, which amounts to approximately $6.2 million per quarter, has been included in selling, general, and administrative expense beginning in March 2003 and will continue to be
included through March 2006. The 5 million restricted shares have been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share utilizing the treasury stock method. 


Stock Repurchase Plan  


In July 1999, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does
not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time. 


During
the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company entered into a forward purchase agreement to acquire 1.5 million shares of its common stock in September of 2003 at an average price of $16.64 per
share for a total cost of $25.5 million. In August 2003, the Company settled this agreement prior to its maturity, at which time the Company's common stock had a fair value of $22.81.
Other than this forward purchase transaction, the Company has not engaged in any transactions to repurchase its common stock since fiscal 2000. Since inception of the stock repurchase plan, the
Company had repurchased a total of 6.55 million shares at a cost of $217 million. The Company was authorized to repurchase up to an additional $283 million of its common stock as
of September 25, 2004. 


Preferred Stock  


The Company has 5 million shares of authorized preferred stock, none of which is outstanding. Under the terms of the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation, the
Board of Directors is authorized to determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the Company's authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock. 


Comprehensive Income  


Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under
generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders' equity but are excluded from net income. The Company's other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency
translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as
available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges.

and 2002, respectively. The tax effect on the reclassification adjustment for net gains (losses) included in net income was $1 million, $(8) million and $10 million for fiscal 2004,
2003, and 2002, respectively.

derivative gains (losses) reclassified from other comprehensive income was $(13) million, $(7) million and $8 million for fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. 


Note 8Employee Benefit Plans  


2003 Employee Stock Option Plan  


At the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on April 24, 2003, the shareholders approved an amendment to the 1998 Executive Officer Stock Plan to change the name of the
plan to the 2003 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 2003 Plan), to provide for broad-based grants to all employees in addition to executive officers and other key employees and to prohibit future
"repricings" of employee stock options, including 6-months-plus-1-day option exchange programs, without shareholder approval. Based on the terms of
individual option grants, options granted under the 2003 Plan generally expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on
continued employment, with 


90








 


either
annual or quarterly vesting. The 2003 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, and stock purchase
rights. 


1997 Employee Stock Option Plan  


In August 1997, the Company's Board of Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 1997 Plan), a non-shareholder approved plan for grants of
stock options to employees who are not officers of the Company. Based on the terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 1997 Plan generally expire 7 to 10 years after the
grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment, with either annual or quarterly vesting. As a result of shareholder approval of amendments
to the 1998 Executive Officer Stock Plan in April 2003, the Company terminated the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan and cancelled all remaining unissued shares totaling 14,295,351 following the
completion of an employee stock option exchange program in October 2003. 


Employee Stock Option Exchange Program  


On March 20, 2003, the Company announced a voluntary employee stock option exchange program (the Exchange Program) whereby eligible employees, other than executive
officers and members of the Board of Directors, had an opportunity to exchange outstanding options with exercise prices at or above $25.00 per share for a predetermined smaller number of new stock
options issued with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of one share of the Company's common stock on the day the new awards are issued, which was to be at least six months plus one day
after the exchange options are cancelled. On April 17, 2003, in accordance with the Exchange Program, the Company cancelled options to purchase 16,569,193 shares of its common stock. On
October 22, 2003, new stock options totaling 6,697,368 shares were issued to employees at an exercise price of $22.76 per share, which is equivalent to the closing price of the Company's stock
on that date. No financial or accounting impact to the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flow was associated with this transaction. 


1997 Director Stock Option Plan  


In August 1997, the Company's Board of Directors adopted a shareholder approved Director Stock Option Plan (DSOP) for non-employee directors of the Company.
Initial grants of 30,000 options under the DSOP vest in three equal installments on each of the first through third anniversaries of the date of grant, and subsequent annual grants of 10,000 options
are fully vested at grant. 


Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans  


Certain of the Company's executive officers, including Mr. Timothy D. Cook, Mr. Jonathan Rubinstein, Mr. Bertrand Serlet, and Mr. Avadis Tevanian,
Jr., have entered into trading plans pursuant to Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. A trading plan is a written document that
pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company's stock including the exercise and sale
of employee stock options and shares acquired pursuant to the Company's employee stock purchase plan and upon vesting of restricted stock units. 


Employee Stock Purchase Plan  


The Company has a shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan (the Purchase Plan), under which substantially all employees may purchase common stock through payroll
deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values as of the beginning and end of six month offering periods. Stock purchases under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of an
employee's compensation, up to a maximum 


91








 


of
$25,000 in any calendar year. Beginning with the six-month offering period that started on June 30, 2003, the number of shares authorized for issuance is limited to a total of
1 million shares per offering period. During 2004, 2003, and 2002, 2.0 million, 2.1 million, and 1.8 million, respectively were issued under the Purchase Plan. As of
September 25, 2004, approximately 2 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan. 


Employee Savings Plan  


The Company has an employee savings plan (the Savings Plan) qualifying as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the
Savings Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limit ($13,000 for calendar year 2004). The
Company matches 50% to 100% of each employee's contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employee's earnings. The Company's matching contributions to the Savings Plan
were approximately $24 million, $21 million, and $19 million in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

As
of September 27, 2003, the Company had exercisable options to purchase 38.8 million shares outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $18.75 per share. As of
September 28, 2002, the Company had exercisable options to purchase 57.9 million shares outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $30.85 per share. 


The
Company had 2.515 million restricted stock units outstanding as of September 25, 2004, which were excluded from the options outstanding balances in the preceding tables. None of
these restricted stock units were vested as of September 25, 2004. The grant of these restricted stock units has been deducted from the shares available for grant under the Company's stock
option plans. 


Note 9Stock-Based Compensation  


The
Company has provided pro forma disclosures in Note 1 of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the effect on net income and earnings per share as if the fair value method of
accounting for stock compensation had been used for its employee stock option grants and employee stock purchase plan purchases. These pro forma effects have been estimated at the date of grant and
beginning of the period, respectively, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. 


For
purposes of the pro forma disclosures provided pursuant to SFAS No. 123, the option awards issued in October 2003 and the awards cancelled as part of the Employee Stock Option
Exchange Program have been accounted for using modification accounting. In accordance with SFAS No. 123, the grant date of the awards issued is the date of acceptance of the exchange offer by
participating employees. The cancellation of certain of the Company's CEO's options and replacement with restricted shares in March 2003 is also being accounted for using modification
accounting for purposes of the pro forma disclosures provided pursuant to SFAS No. 123.

purposes of the pro forma disclosures provided pursuant to SFAS No. 123, the expected volatility assumptions used by the Company prior to the third quarter of 2003 had been based solely on
the historical volatility of the Company's common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Company's stock options. Beginning in the third quarter of
2003, the Company has modified this approach to consider other relevant factors including implied volatility in market traded options on the Company's common stock and the impact of unusual
fluctuations not reasonably expected to recur on the historical volatility of the Company's common stock. The Company will continue to monitor these and other relevant factors in developing the
expected volatility assumption used to value future awards. 


Beginning
in the third quarter of 2003, the Company shortened its estimate of the expected life of new options granted to its employees from 4 years to 3.5 years. The Company bases its
expected life assumption on its historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock options it grants to employees. The change in the expected life assumption made during the third
quarter of 2003 was the result of the expected impact of shortening the contractual life of new options granted to employees from 10 years to 7 years and changing the vesting provisions
of new options granted to employees from 4 year straight-line annual vesting to 4 year straight-line quarterly vesting. 


Note 10Commitments and Contingencies  


Lease Commitments  


The Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any other
off-balance-sheet financing arrangements. The major facility leases are for terms of 5 to 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of 3 to 5 additional years. Leases
for retail space are for terms of 5 to 16 years and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of September 25, 2004, the Company's total future minimum lease payments
under noncancelable operating leases were $617 million, of which $436 million related to leases for retail space. 


Rent
expense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $103 million, $97 million, and $92 million in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

Accrued Warranty and Indemnifications  


The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period for hardware products is typically one year from the date of
purchase by the end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for Apple service parts used to repair Apple hardware products. The Company provides currently for the
estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product warranties at the time related revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals for product warranty
obligations include the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected
cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company's typical experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting warranty
liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future expectations.

The
Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property
rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim
against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against itself or an
indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a material adverse
effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Therefore, the Company did not record a liability for infringement costs as of either September 25, 2004 or
September 27, 2003.

Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product  


Although most components essential to the Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, other key components (including microprocessors and
application-specific integrated circuits, or ("ASICs")) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some other key components, while currently available to the Company from
multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide availability and pricing pressures. In addition, the Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal
computer industry, and new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for and
subsequently qualifies additional suppliers. If the supply of a key single-sourced component to the Company were to be delayed or curtailed or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays shipments
of completed products to the Company, the Company's ability to ship related products in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely affected. The Company's business and financial
performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an
alternative source. Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to
meet the Company's requirements. Finally, significant portions of the Company's CPUs, logic boards, and assembled products are now manufactured by outsourcing partners, the majority of which occurs in
various parts of Asia. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company's operating
results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production obligations. 


Contingencies  


Beginning on September 27, 2001, three shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the
Company and its Chief Executive Officer. These lawsuits are substantially identical, and purport to bring suit on behalf of persons who purchased the Company's publicly traded common stock between
July 19, 2000, and September 28, 2000. The complaints allege violations of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. The Company
believes these claims are without merit and intends to defend them vigorously. The Company filed a motion to dismiss on June 4, 2002, which was heard by the Court on September 13, 2002.
On December 11, 2002, the Court granted the Company's motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action, with leave to Plaintiffs to amend their complaint within thirty days. Plaintiffs
filed their amended complaint on January 31, 2003, and on March 17, 2003, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The Court heard the Company's motion on
July 11, 2003 and dismissed Plaintiffs' claims with prejudice on August 12, 2003. Plaintiffs have appealed the ruling. 


The
Company is subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully adjudicated. In the opinion of management, the Company
does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity
or results of operations. However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these
legal matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. 


Production
and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers 


96








 




the
ability to return product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been
passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates including various European Union member countries, Japan and certain states within the U.S. Although the Company does not anticipate any
material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company's results of operations and financial position. 


Note 11Segment Information and Geographic Data  


In
accordance with SFAS No. 131, 
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information
, the Company reports segment information
based on the "management" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's
reportable segments. 


The
Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable operating segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas segment includes
both North and South America, except for the activities of the Company's Retail segment. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Japan segment
includes only Japan and excludes revenue from the Company's own retail stores in Japan, which is included in the Company's Retail segment. The Retail segment operated Apple-owned retail stores in the
U.S. and Japan during fiscal 2004. Other operating segments include Asia-Pacific, which includes Australia and Asia except for Japan, and the Company's subsidiary, FileMaker, Inc.
Each reportable geographic operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services, and the accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described
in Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," except as described below for the Retail segment. 


The
Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales. The Retail segment's performance is also evaluated based on operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are
generally based on the location of the customers. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the
segment. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses that are managed outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include
various corporate expenses, manufacturing costs not included in standard costs, income taxes, and various nonrecurring charges. Corporate expenses include research and development, corporate marketing
expenses, and other separately managed general and administrative expenses including certain corporate expenses associated with support of the Retail segment. The Company does not include intercompany
transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. Segment assets exclude corporate assets. Corporate assets include cash, short-term and long-term investments,
manufacturing facilities, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets, and retail store construction-in-progress that is not subject
to depreciation. Except for the Retail segment, capital expenditures for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment. Capital expenditures by the Retail segment were
$104 million, $92 million and $106 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 


Operating
income for all segments, except Retail, includes cost of sales at manufacturing standard cost, other cost of sales, related sales and marketing costs, and certain general and administrative
costs. This measure of operating income, which includes manufacturing profit, provides a comparable basis for comparison between the Company's various geographic segments. Certain manufacturing
expenses and 


97








 




related
adjustments not included in segment cost of sales, including variances between standard and actual manufacturing costs and the mark-up above standard cost for product supplied to
the Retail segment, are included in corporate expenses. 


Management
assesses the operating performance of the Retail segment differently than it assesses the operating performance of the Company's geographic segments. The Retail segment revenue and
operating income is intended to depict a comparable measure to that of the Company's major channel partners in the U.S. operating retail stores so the Company can evaluate the Retail segment
performance as if it were a channel partner. Therefore, the Company makes three significant adjustments to the Retail segment for management reporting purposes that are not included in the results of
the Company's other segments. 


First,
the Retail segment's operating income includes cost of sales for Apple products at an amount normally charged to major channel partners in the U.S. operating retail stores, less the cost of
sales programs and incentives provided to those channel partners and the Company's cost to support those partners. For the years ended September 25, 2004, September 27, 2003, and
September 28, 2002, this resulted in the recognition of additional cost of sales above standard cost by the Retail segment and an offsetting benefit to corporate expenses of approximately
$213 million, $106 million, and $52 million, respectively. 


Second,
the Company's extended warranty, support and service contracts are transferred to the Retail segment at the same cost as that charged to the Company's major retail channel partners in the
U.S., resulting in a comparable measure of revenue and gross margin between the Company's Retail stores and those retail channel partners. The Retail segment recognizes the full amount of revenue and
cost of sales at the time of sale of the Company's extended warranty, support and service contracts. Because the Company has not yet earned the revenue or incurred the costs associated with the sale
of these contracts, an offset to these amounts is recognized in other operating segments' net sales and cost of sales. For the year ended September 25, 2004, this resulted in the recognition of
net sales and cost of sales by the Retail segment, with corresponding offsets in other operating segments, of $54 million and $37 million, respectively. For the year ended
September 27, 2003, the net sales and cost of sales recognized by the Retail segment for sales of extended warranty, support and service contracts were $30 million and
$20 million, respectively. For the year ended September 28, 2002, this resulted in the recognition of net sales and cost of sales by the Retail segment of $8 million and
$6 million, respectively. 


Third,
the Company has opened six high profile stores in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Tokyo, Japan and Osaka, Japan as of September 25, 2004 and has an additional store under
development in London, England, which is expected to open by the end of calendar year 2004. These high profile stores are larger than the Company's typical retail stores and were designed to further
promote brand awareness and provide a venue for certain corporate sales and marketing activities, including corporate briefings. As such, the Company allocates certain operating expenses associated
with these stores to corporate marketing expense to reflect the estimated benefit realized Company-wide. The allocation of these operating costs is based on the excess amount incurred for
a high profile store to that of a more typical Company retail location. Expenses allocated to corporate marketing resulting from the operations of these stores were $16 million,
$6 million and $1 million for the years ended September 25, 2004, September 27, 2003, and September 28, 2002 respectively.

A
large portion of the Company's net sales is derived from its international operations. Also, a majority of the raw materials used in the Company's products is obtained from sources outside of the
U.S., and a majority of the products sold by the Company is assembled internationally in the Company's facility in Cork, Ireland or by third-party vendors in Taiwan, Korea, the Netherlands, the
People's Republic of China, and the Czech Republic. As a result, the Company is subject to risks associated with foreign operations, such as obtaining governmental permits and approvals, currency
exchange fluctuations, currency restrictions, political instability, labor problems, trade restrictions, and changes in tariff and freight charges. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of
net sales in 2004, 2003 or 2002.

Note 12Related Party Transactions and Certain Other Transactions  


In
March 2002, the Company entered into a Reimbursement Agreement with its CEO, Mr. Steven P. Jobs, for the reimbursement of expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs in the operation of his
private plane when used for Apple business. The Reimbursement Agreement became effective for expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs for Apple business purposes since he took delivery of the plane in
May 2001. The Company recognized a total of $483,000, $404,000, and $1,168,000 in expenses pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. All expenses
recognized pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement have been included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. 


In
connection with a relocation assistance package, the Company in May 2000 loaned Mr. Ronald B. Johnson, Senior Vice President, Retail, $1.5 million for the purchase of his
principal residence. The loan was secured by a deed of trust and was due and payable in May 2004. Under the terms of the loan, Mr. Johnson agreed that should he exercise any of his stock
options prior to the due date of the loan, he would pay the Company an amount equal to the lesser of (1) an amount equal to 50% of the total net gain realized from the exercise of the options;
or (2) $375,000 multiplied by the number of years between the exercise date and the date of the loan. Mr. Johnson repaid $750,000 of this loan in fiscal 2003 and repaid the remaining
balance of $750,000 in fiscal 2004. 


Mr. Jerome
York, a member of the Board of Directors of the Company, is a member of an investment group that purchased MicroWarehouse, Inc. (MicroWarehouse) in January 2000. Until
September 7, 2003, he also served as Microwarehouse's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. MicroWarehouse was a reseller of computer hardware, software and peripheral products,
including products made by the 


101








 




Company.
On September 8, 2003, CDW Corporation (CDW), acquired selected North American assets of MicroWarehouse. MicroWarehouse subsequently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the
U.S. MicroWarehouse accounted for approximately 0.3%, 2.4% and 3.3% of the Company's net sales for the years ended September 25, 2004, September 27, 2003, and September 28, 2002,
respectively. Trade receivables from MicroWarehouse were $4.3 million and $9.9 million as of September 25, 2004 and September 27, 2003, respectively. The Company has
provided what it believes to be an adequate allowance on the outstanding receivable based on the Company's secured interest position in selected MicroWarehouse assets and the expected payments to
unsecured creditors. Sales to MicroWarehouse and related trade receivables were generally subject to the same terms and conditions as those with the Company's other resellers. In addition, the Company
has purchased miscellaneous equipment and supplies from MicroWarehouse. Total purchases amounted to approximately $2.3 million and $2.9 million for the years ended September 27,
2003 and September 28, 2002, respectively. No purchases were made by the Company from MicroWarehouse in fiscal 2004.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM    
 


The
Board of Directors and Shareholders

Apple Computer, Inc.: 


We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Computer, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 25, 2004 and September 27, 2003, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 25, 2004. These consolidated
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. 


We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 


In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Apple Computer, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
September 25, 2004 and September 27, 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 25,
2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 


As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for asset retirement obligations and for financial instruments with characteristics
of both liabilities and equity in 2003 and changed its method of accounting for goodwill in 2002.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
Note 1
  
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 
Apple Inc.
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively Apple or the Company) designs, manufactures, and markets personal computers, mobile communication and media devices, and portable digital music players, and sells a variety of
related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications. The Company sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores, and direct sales force, and third-party cellular
network carriers, wholesalers, resellers and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Macintosh (Mac), iPhone, iPad and iPod compatible products including application software, printers, storage
devices, speakers, headphones, and various other accessories and supplies through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise, government and creative customers. 


Basis of Presentation and Preparation 
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these consolidated financial
statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior year amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current years presentation. 


The Companys fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Companys fiscal years
2010, 2009 and 2008 ended on September 25, 2010, September 26, 2009 and September 27, 2008, respectively, and included 52 weeks each. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter approximately every six years to
realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years or quarters refer to the Companys fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters of those fiscal years. 


Retrospective Adoption of New Accounting Principles 
 
In September 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended the accounting standards related to revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables and arrangements
that include software elements (new accounting principles). The new accounting principles permitted prospective or retrospective adoption, and the Company elected retrospective adoption during the first quarter of 2010. 


Under the historical accounting principles, the Company was required to account for sales of both iPhone and Apple TV using subscription
accounting because the Company indicated it might from time-to-time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features for those products free of charge. Under subscription accounting, revenue and associated product cost of sales for iPhone
and Apple TV were deferred at the time of sale and recognized on a straight-line basis over each products estimated economic life. This resulted in the deferral of significant amounts of revenue and cost of sales related to iPhone and Apple
TV. 
 
The new accounting principles affect the Companys accounting for all past and current sales of iPhone, iPad, Apple
TV and for sales of iPod touch beginning in June 2010. The new accounting principles require the Company to account for the sale of these devices as two deliverables. The first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality
of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale, and the second deliverable is the right included with the purchase of these devices to receive on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades and features relating to the
products essential software. The new accounting principles result in the recognition of a substantial portion of the revenue and all product costs from

Table of Contents



the sale of these devices at the time of their sale. Additionally, the Company is required to estimate a standalone selling price for the unspecified software upgrade rights included with the
sale of these devices and recognizes that amount ratably over the 24-month estimated life of the related hardware device. 


Refer to the Explanatory Note and Note 2, Retrospective Adoption of New Accounting Principles in the 2009 Form
10-K for additional information on the impact of adoption of the new accounting principles, which sections are incorporated herein by reference. 
 
Revenue Recognition 
 
Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale
of hardware, software, digital content and applications, peripherals, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or
determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Companys product sales, these criteria are met at the time the
product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company legally retains a portion of
the risk of loss on these sales during transit. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products (e.g., Macs, iPhones, iPads, iPods and peripherals), software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the
hardware, and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following
types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware. 


The Company sells software and peripheral products obtained from other companies. The Company generally establishes its own pricing and
retains related inventory risk, is the primary obligor in sales transactions with its customers, and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. Accordingly, the Company generally recognizes revenue for the sale of products obtained
from other companies based on the gross amount billed. For certain sales made through the iTunes Store, including sales of third-party software applications for the Companys iOS devices, the Company is not the primary obligor to users of the
software, and third-party developers determine the selling price of their software. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing only the commission it retains from each sale and including that commission in net sales
in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The portion of the sales price paid by users that is remitted by the Company to third-party developers is not reflected in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations. 


The Company records deferred revenue when it receives payments in advance of the delivery of products or the performance of services.
This includes amounts that have been deferred related to embedded unspecified and specified software upgrades rights. The Company sells gift cards redeemable at its retail and online stores, and also sells gift cards redeemable on the iTunes Store
for the purchase of content and software. The Company records deferred revenue upon the sale of the card, which is relieved upon redemption of the card by the customer. Revenue from AppleCare service and support contracts is deferred and recognized
ratably over the service coverage periods. AppleCare service and support contracts typically include extended phone support, repair services, web-based support resources and diagnostic tools offered under the Companys standard limited
warranty. 
 
The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer
incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. The estimated cost of these programs is recognized in the period the Company has sold the product and committed to a plan. The Company
also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Companys historical experience. Revenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected
taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.

Revenue Recognition for
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables 
 
For multi-element arrangements that include tangible products that contain
software that is essential to the tangible products functionality and undelivered software elements that relate to the tangible products essential software, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative
selling prices. In such circumstances, the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE), (ii) third-party
evidence of selling price (TPE), and (iii) best estimate of the selling price (ESP). VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that
deliverable. ESPs reflect the Companys best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. 
 
As described in more detail below, for all past and current sales of iPhone, iPad, Apple TV and for sales of iPod touch beginning in June 2010, the Company has indicated it may from time-to-time provide
future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers. The Company has identified two deliverables in arrangements involving the sale of these devices. The first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the
functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale. The second deliverable is the embedded right included with the purchase of iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Apple TV to receive on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified
software upgrades and features relating to the products essential software. The Company has allocated revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method. Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for the two
deliverables, the allocation of revenue has been based on the Companys ESPs. Amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue
recognition have been met. Amounts allocated to the embedded unspecified software upgrade rights are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the 24-month estimated life of each of these devices. All product cost of sales, including
estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs for engineering and sales and marketing are expensed as incurred. 
 
The Companys process for determining its ESP for deliverables without VSOE or TPE considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each
deliverable. The Company believes its customers, particularly consumers, would be reluctant to buy unspecified software upgrade rights related to iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Apple TV. This view is primarily based on the fact that unspecified
upgrade rights do not obligate the Company to provide upgrades at a particular time or at all, and do not specify to customers which upgrades or features will be delivered. Therefore, the Company has concluded that if it were to sell upgrade rights
on a standalone basis, including those rights associated with iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Apple TV, the selling price would be relatively low. Key factors considered by the Company in developing the ESPs for these upgrade rights include prices
charged by the Company for similar offerings, the Companys historical pricing practices, the nature of the upgrade rights (e.g., unspecified and when-and-if-available), and the relative ESP of the upgrade rights as compared to the total
selling price of the product. The Company may also consider, when appropriate, the impact of other products and services, including advertising services, on selling price assumptions when developing and reviewing its ESPs for software upgrade rights
and related deliverables. The Company may also consider additional factors as appropriate, including the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist, and product-specific business objectives. 


Beginning in the third quarter of 2010 in conjunction with the announcement of iOS 4, the Companys ESPs for the embedded software
upgrade rights included with iPhone, iPad and iPod touch reflect the positive financial impact expected by the Company as a result of its introduction of a mobile advertising platform for these devices and the expectation of customers regarding
software that includes or supports an advertising component. iOS 4 supports iAd, the Companys new mobile advertising platform, which enables applications on iPhone, iPad and iPod touch to embed media-rich advertisements. 


For all periods presented, the Companys ESP for the embedded software upgrade right included with each Apple TV sold is $10. The
Companys ESP for the software upgrade right included with each iPhone sold through the 


 
 
52 






Table of Contents



Companys second quarter of 2010 was $25. Beginning in April 2010 in conjunction with the Companys announcement of iOS 4 for iPhone, the Company lowered its ESP for the software
upgrade right included with each iPhone to $10. 
 
Beginning with initial sales of iPad in April 2010, the Company has also
indicated it may from time-to-time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to iPad customers. The Companys ESP for the embedded software upgrade right included with the sale of each iPad is $10. In June 2010,
the Company announced that certain previously sold iPod touch models would receive an upgrade to iOS 4 free of charge and indicated iPod touch devices running on iOS 4 may from time-to-time receive future unspecified software upgrades and features
free of charge. The Companys ESP for the embedded software upgrade right included with each iPod touch sold beginning in June 2010 is $5. 
 
The Company accounts for multiple element arrangements that consist only of software or software-related products, including the sale of upgrades to previously sold software, in accordance with industry
specific accounting guidance for software and software-related transactions. For such transactions, revenue on arrangements that include multiple elements is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element, and fair value
is determined by VSOE. If the Company cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in such multiple-element arrangements, the Company defers revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been
performed, or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements. When the fair value of a delivered element has not been established, but fair value exists for the undelivered elements, the Company uses the
residual method to recognize revenue. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue. 


Except as described for iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Apple TV, the Company generally does not offer unspecified upgrade rights to its
customers in connection with software sales or the sale of AppleCare extended warranty and support contracts. A limited number of the Companys software products are available with maintenance agreements that grant customers rights to
unspecified future upgrades over the maintenance term on a when and if available basis. Revenue associated with such maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term. 
 
Shipping Costs 
 
For all periods presented, amounts billed to customers
related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue, and the Companys shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales. 


Warranty Expense 
 
The
Company generally provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. The Company assesses the adequacy of its pre-existing warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary
based on actual experience and changes in future estimates. 
 
Software Development Costs 


Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed
are subject to capitalization beginning when a products technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. In most instances, the Companys products are released soon
after technological feasibility has been established. Therefore, costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally most software development costs have been expensed as incurred.

 
The Company did not capitalize any software development costs during 2010. In 2009 and 2008, the Company capitalized $71
million and $11 million, respectively, of costs associated with the development of Mac OS X 


 
 
53 






Table of Contents



Version 10.6 Snow Leopard (Mac OS X Snow Leopard), which was released during the fourth quarter of 2009. The capitalized costs are being amortized to cost of sales on a straight-line
basis over a three year estimated useful life of the underlying technology.
 
Total amortization related to capitalized software
development costs was $48 million, $25 million and $27 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 
 
Advertising Costs 


Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $691 million, $501 million and $486 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively. 
 
Stock-Based Compensation 
 
The Company accounts for stock-based payment transactions in which the Company receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are
based on the fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. Stock-based compensation cost for restricted stock units (RSUs) is measured based on the closing fair
market value of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation cost for stock options is estimated at the grant date based on each options fair-value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM)
option-pricing model. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation cost as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company will recognize a benefit from stock-based compensation in equity if an incremental
tax benefit is realized by following the ordering provisions of the tax law. In addition, the Company accounts for the indirect effects of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit, the foreign tax credit and the domestic manufacturing
deduction through the income statement. Further information regarding stock-based compensation can be found in Note 7, Shareholders Equity and Stock-Based Compensation of this Form 10-K. 


Income Taxes 
 
The
provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax
bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax
assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. 


The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be
sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50%
likelihood of being realized upon settlement. See Note 6, Income Taxes of this Form 10-K for additional information. 
 
Earnings
Per Common Share 
 
Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the
weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued. 


 
 
54 






Table of Contents



Potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options, shares to be purchased under the employee stock purchase plan and unvested RSUs. The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive
securities is reflected in diluted earnings per common share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the Companys common stock can result in a greater dilutive
effect from potentially dilutive securities. 
 
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per
common share for the three years ended September 25, 2010 (in thousands, except net income in millions and per share amounts):

securities representing 1.6 million, 12.6 million and 10.3 million shares of common stock for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share for these periods because their
effect would have been antidilutive. 
 
Financial Instruments 
 
Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities 
 
All highly liquid investments
with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. The Companys debt and marketable equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. Management determines the
appropriate classification of its investments in debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates the available-for-sale designations as of each balance sheet date. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or
long-term based on each instruments underlying contractual maturity date. Marketable securities with maturities of less than 12 months are classified as short-term and marketable securities with maturities greater than 12 months are classified
as long-term. These securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of shareholders equity. The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method.

 
Derivative Financial Instruments 
 
The Company accounts for its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value. Derivatives that are not defined as hedges must be adjusted to fair value through
earnings. 
 
For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated
as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or
periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in current earnings. To receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly
effective in offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. For
derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that are designated as fair value hedges, the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the
hedged item attributable to 


 
 
55 






Table of Contents



the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current period. The Company did not have a net gain or loss on these derivative instruments during 2010, 2009 and 2008. The net gain or loss on
the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure of the net investment in a foreign operation is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation
adjustment. For forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses
related to this component are recognized in current earnings. 
 
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 


The Company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. The Company considers historical
experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of the Companys customers, current economic conditions, and other factors that may affect customers ability to pay. 


Inventories 
 
Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out method, or market. If the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. The
Companys inventories consist primarily of components and finished goods for all periods presented. 
 
Property, Plant and Equipment

 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, up to five years for equipment, and the shorter of lease terms or ten years for leasehold improvements. The Company
capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $815 million, $606 million and $387 million during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 


Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets 
 
The Company reviews property, plant and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property,
plant and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. The Company did not record any
significant impairments during 2010, 2009 and 2008. 
 
The Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives, rather such assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. The Company performs its goodwill and intangible
asset impairment tests on or about August 31 of each year. The Company did not recognize any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in 2010, 2009 and 2008. The Company established reporting units based on its current reporting
structure. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit. 
 
The Company amortizes its intangible assets with definite lives over their estimated useful lives and reviews these assets for impairment. The Company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible
assets with definite lives over periods ranging from three to ten years.

Fair Value Measurements

 
During 2009, the Company adopted the FASBs new accounting standard on fair value measurements and disclosures for
all financial assets and liabilities. The new accounting principles define fair value, provide a framework for measuring fair value, and expand the disclosures required for fair value measurements. During the first quarter of 2010, the Company
adopted the new fair value accounting principles for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, which did not have a
material effect on the Companys financial condition or operating results. 
 
The Company applies fair value accounting for
all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from
selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value,
the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk,
transfer restrictions and credit risk. In accordance with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company has not elected the fair value option
for any eligible financial instruments. 
 
Foreign Currency Translation and Remeasurement 


The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange
rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are credited or charged to foreign
currency translation included in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity. The Companys subsidiaries that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates
in effect at the end of each period, and inventories, property, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. Gains and losses from these remeasurements were insignificant and have been included in the Companys results of
operations. 
 
Segment Information 
 
The Company reports segment information based on the management approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing
performance as the source of the Companys reportable segments. Information about the Companys products, major customers and geographic areas on a company-wide basis is also disclosed. 


Business Combinations 


In December 2007, the FASB issued a new accounting standard for business combinations, which established principles and requirements for
how an acquirer is to recognize and measure in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree in a business combination. This new accounting standard also
established principles regarding how goodwill acquired in a business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase should be recognized and measured, requiring the capitalization of in-process research and development at fair value and the expensing
of acquisition-related costs as incurred, as well as providing guidelines on the disclosure requirements. In April 2009, the FASB amended this new accounting standard to require that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination
that arise from contingencies be recognized at fair value, if the fair value can be determined during the measurement period. The Company adopted the new business combination accounting standard in the first quarter of 2010 and applied these
principles to any business combinations completed in or after the first quarter of 2010. The adoption of the new business combination accounting standard did not have a material effect on the Companys financial condition or operating results.

The Company had net unrealized gains on its investment portfolio of $180 million and $57 million as of
September 25, 2010 and September 26, 2009, respectively. The net unrealized gains as of September 25, 2010 and September 26, 2009 related primarily to long-term marketable securities. The Company may sell certain of its
marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. The Company recognized no significant net realized gains or losses during 2010, 2009 and 2008 related
to such sales. The maturities of the Companys long-term marketable securities generally range from one year to five years
.

The Company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be
temporary in nature. The unrealized losses on the Companys marketable securities were caused primarily by changes in market interest rates or widening credit spreads. The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its policy
generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Companys investment policy requires investments to be investment grade, primarily rated single-A or better, with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal
loss. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating the investments for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value
has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the Companys intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell, the investment before recovery of the
investments amortized cost basis. During the years ended September 25, 2010 and September 26, 2009, the Company did not recognize any significant impairment charges. As of September 25, 2010, the Company does not consider any of
its investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired. 
 
Derivative Financial Instruments 


The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. The Company may enter into
foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset some of the foreign exchange risk of expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales, of net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and on certain existing
assets and liabilities. To help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Companys subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar, hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency
revenue. The Companys subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar and who sell in local currencies, may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries functional currencies. The
Company typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases for three to six months. To help protect the net investment in a foreign operation from adverse changes in foreign currency
exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company may also enter into
foreign currency forward and option contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. However, the Company may
choose not to hedge certain foreign currency exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to immateriality, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no
assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange rates.

The Companys
accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. The Company records all derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The effective portions of cash
flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment.
Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments and the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges and net investment hedges are adjusted to fair value through earnings in other income and expense. 


The Company had a net deferred loss associated with cash flow hedges of approximately $252 million and a net deferred gain of $1 million,
net of taxes, recorded in other comprehensive income as of September 25, 2010 and September 26, 2009, respectively. Other comprehensive income associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue is recognized as a component of net
sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and other comprehensive income related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases is recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized.
Substantially all of the Companys hedged transactions as of September 25, 2010 are expected to occur within six months. 
 
Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within
a subsequent two month time period. Deferred gains and losses in other comprehensive income associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified immediately into earnings through other income and expense. Any subsequent changes in fair value
of such derivative instruments also are reflected in current earnings unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. The Company did not recognize any significant net gains or losses related to the loss of hedge designation on
discontinued cash flow hedges during 2010, 2009 and 2008. 
 
The Company had an unrealized net loss on net investment hedges of
$9 million and $2 million, net of taxes, included in the cumulative translation adjustment account of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) as of September 25, 2010 and September 26, 2009, respectively. The ineffective
portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness test of net investment hedges are recorded in current earnings in other income and expense. 
 
The Company recognized in earnings a net loss of $123 million and $133 million on foreign currency forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments during the year ended
September 25, 2010 and September 26, 2009, respectively. These amounts represent the net gain or loss on the derivative contracts and do not include changes in the related exposures, which generally offset a portion of the gain or loss on
the derivative contracts. 
 
The following table shows the notional principal and credit risk amounts of the Companys
derivative instruments outstanding as of September 25, 2010 and September 26, 2009 (in millions):

The notional
principal amounts for derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding and does not represent the amount of the Companys exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts represent the Companys
gross exposure to potential accounting loss on these transactions if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency exchange rates at each respective date. The Companys gross
exposure on these transactions may be further mitigated by

collateral received from certain counterparties. The Companys exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a function of currency exchange rates. Although the table above
reflects the notional principal and credit risk amounts of the Companys foreign exchange instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the foreign exchange instruments are intended to
hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. 


The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with
the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuate from
contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values. As of September 25, 2010, the Company has posted cash collateral related to the derivative instruments
under its collateral security arrangements of $445 million and recorded the offsetting balance as other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company did not record any significant amounts of cash collateral related to the derivative
instruments under its master netting arrangements as of September 26, 2009. The Company did not have any derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features that would require it to post additional collateral as of
September 25, 2010 or September 26, 2009. 
 
The estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used
pricing models and prevailing financial market information as of September 25, 2010. Refer to Note 3, Fair Value Measurements of this Form 10-K, for additional information on the fair value measurements for all financial assets and
liabilities, including derivative assets and derivative liabilities, that are measured at fair value in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis. The following tables show the Companys derivative instruments measured at gross

Accounts Receivable 


Trade Receivables 
 
The
Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers and directly to certain education, consumer and enterprise customers. The Company generally does not require collateral
from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in
Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Australia, or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such,
the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables not covered by collateral, third-party financing arrangements, or credit insurance are
outstanding with the Companys third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. Trade receivables from two of the Companys customers accounted for 15% and 12% of trade receivables as of
September 25, 2010 and one of the Companys customers accounted for 16% of trade receivables as of September 26, 2009. The Companys cellular network carriers accounted for 64% and 51% of trade receivables as of
September 25, 2010 and as of September 26, 2009, respectively. The additions and write-offs to the Companys allowance for doubtful accounts during 2010, 2009 and 2008 were not significant. 


Vendor Non-Trade Receivables 
 
The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final
products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. Vendor non-trade receivables from two of the Companys vendors accounted for 57% and 24%, respectively, of non-trade receivables as of September 25,
2010 and two of the Companys vendors accounted for 40% and 36%, respectively, of non-trade receivables as of September 26, 2009. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in net sales and does not recognize any profits on
these sales until the related products are sold by the Company, at which time any profit is recognized as a reduction of cost of sales.

Note 3  Fair Value
Measurements 
 
The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer
a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal
or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and credit risk.

 
The Company applies the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three
levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement: 
 
Level 1 
 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
 
Level 2 
 Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets,
or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 
 
Level 3 
 Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect managements estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

 
The Companys valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity
securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of all other financial instruments, all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings,
were valued based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.

The foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pretax earnings of $13.0 billion, $6.6 billion
and $4.6 billion in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Companys consolidated financial statements provide for any related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated, aside from undistributed earnings of certain of the Companys
foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the U.S. As of September 25, 2010, U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $12.3 billion of such earnings. The amount of
unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these temporary differences is estimated to be approximately $4.0 billion. 
 
As
of September 25, 2010 and September 26, 2009, $30.8 billion and $17.4 billion, respectively, of the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S.
dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. 
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits, and the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

The Companys
income taxes payable have been reduced by the tax benefits from employee stock plan awards. For stock options, the Company receives an income tax benefit calculated as the difference between the fair market value of the stock issued at the time of
the exercise and the option price, tax effected. For RSUs, the Company receives an income tax benefit upon the awards vesting equal to the tax effect of the underlying stocks fair market value. The Company had net excess tax
benefits from employee stock plan awards of $742 million, $246 million and $770 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, which were reflected as increases to common stock. 
 
Uncertain Tax Positions 
 
Tax positions are evaluated in a two-step process.
The Company first determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination. If a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold it is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to
recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company classifies gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax
benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
As of September 25, 2010, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $943 million, of which $404 million, if recognized, would affect the Companys effective tax rate. As of
September 26, 2009, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $971 million, of which $307 million, if recognized, would affect the Companys effective tax rate.

The Company includes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for
income taxes. As of September 25, 2010 and September 26, 2009, the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $247 million and $291 million, respectively, which is classified as non-current liabilities in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. In 2010 and 2009, the Company recognized an interest benefit of $43 million and interest expense of $64 million, respectively, in connection with tax matters. 
 
The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, all years prior to 2004
are closed. The Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) has completed its field audit of the Companys federal income tax returns for the years 2004 through 2006 and proposed certain adjustments. The Company has contested certain of
these adjustments through the IRS Appeals Office. The IRS is currently examining the years 2007 through 2009. During the third quarter of 2010, the Company reached a tax settlement with the IRS for the years 2002 through 2003. In connection with the
settlement, the Company reduced its gross unrecognized tax benefits by $100 million and recognized a $52 million tax benefit in the third quarter of 2010. In addition, the Company is also subject to audits by state, local and foreign tax
authorities. In major states and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 1988 and 2001, respectively, generally remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities. 


Management believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the
outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Companys tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for
income tax in the period such resolution occurs. Although timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits would materially change in the next
12 months. 
 
Note 7  Shareholders Equity and Stock-Based Compensation 


Preferred Stock 
 
The
Company has five million shares of authorized preferred stock, none of which is issued or outstanding. Under the terms of the Companys Restated Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors is authorized to determine or alter the rights,
preferences, privileges and restrictions of the Companys authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock. 
 
Comprehensive Income

 
Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income
refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under GAAP are recorded as an element of shareholders equity but are excluded from net income. The Companys other comprehensive income consists

Employee Benefit Plans 


2003 Employee Stock Plan 


The 2003 Employee Stock Plan (the 2003 Plan) is a shareholder approved plan that provides for broad-based equity grants to
employees, including executive officers. The 2003 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, stock purchase rights and performance-based awards. Options granted under the 2003
Plan generally expire seven to ten years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based on continued employment, with either annual, semi-annual or quarterly vesting. In general, RSUs granted under the 2003
Plan vest over two to four years, are subject to the employees continued employment and are paid upon vesting in shares of the Companys common stock on a one-for-one basis. At the Companys 2010 annual meeting of shareholders, the
2003 Plan was amended to (i) increase the number of shares of the Companys common stock that may be delivered pursuant to awards granted under the 2003 Plan by an additional 36,000,000 shares and (ii) extend the Companys
authority to grant awards under the 2003 Plan intended to qualify as performance-based awards within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code through the 2015 annual meeting of shareholders. As of
September 25, 2010, approximately 62.5 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2003 Plan.

1997 Employee Stock Option Plan

 
In August 1997, the Companys Board of Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 1997
Plan), a non-shareholder approved plan for grants of stock options to employees who are not officers of the Company. Options granted under the 1997 Plan generally expire seven to ten years after the grant date. All stock options granted under
the 1997 Plan are fully vested. In October 2003, the Company terminated the 1997 Plan, and no new options can be granted from this plan. 


1997 Director Stock Plan 


In August 1997, the Companys Board of Directors (the Board) adopted a Director Stock Option Plan, which was
subsequently renamed the 1997 Director Stock Plan (the Director Plan) and has been approved by shareholders. As amended, the Director Plan (i) permits the Company to grant awards of RSUs or stock options to the Companys
non-employee directors, (ii) beginning February 25, 2010, provides for automatic initial grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the Board and automatic annual grants of RSUs at each annual meeting of shareholders, and
(iii) permits the Board to prospectively change the relative mixture of stock options and RSUs for the initial and annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the Companys common stock subject to these
grants without shareholder approval. Each share issued with respect to RSUs granted under the plan reduces the number of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares. The Director Plan expires November 9, 2019. As of September 25,
2010, approximately 199,000 shares were reserved for future issuance under the Director Plan. 
 
Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans 


During the fourth quarter of 2010, executive officers Timothy D. Cook, Peter Oppenheimer, D. Bruce Sewell, Philip W. Schiller and Bertrand
Serlet had trading plans pursuant to Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). A trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for
determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Companys stock including the exercise and sale of employee stock options and shares acquired pursuant to the Companys employee stock purchase plan and upon
vesting of RSUs. 
 
Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
 
The Company has a shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan (the Purchase Plan), under which substantially all employees may purchase the Companys common stock through payroll
deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values of the stock as of the beginning and end of six-month offering periods. An employees payroll deductions under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of the employees
compensation and employees may not purchase more than $25,000 of stock for any calendar year. Additionally, no more than 1,000,000 shares may be purchased in the aggregate in any one offering period. As of September 25, 2010,
approximately 3.8 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan. 
 
Employee Savings Plan 


The Company has an employee savings plan (the Savings Plan) qualifying as a deferred salary arrangement under
Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the Savings Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the IRS annual contribution limit ($16,500 for calendar year 2010). The Company matches 50%
to 100% of each employees contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employees eligible earnings. The Companys matching contributions to the Savings Plan were $72 million, $59 million and $50 million
in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The fair value as of the vesting date of RSUs was $1 billion, $221 million and $320 million for
2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Upon vesting, the RSUs are generally net share-settled to cover the required withholding tax and the remaining amount is converted into an equivalent number of shares of common stock. The majority of RSUs that
vested in 2010, 2009 and 2008, were net-share settled such that the Company withheld shares with value equivalent to the employees minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the
appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 1.8 million, 707,000 and 857,000 for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their vesting date as determined by the
Companys closing stock price. Total payments for the employees tax obligations to the taxing authorities were $406 million, $82 million and $124 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity
within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These net-share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the Company as they reduced and retired the number of shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting
and did not represent an expense to the Company.

Aggregate intrinsic
value represents the value of the Companys closing stock price on the last trading day of the fiscal period in excess of the weighted-average exercise price multiplied by the number of options outstanding or exercisable. The aggregate
intrinsic value excludes the effect of stock options that have a zero or negative intrinsic value. Total intrinsic value of options at time of exercise was $2.0 billion, $827 million and $2.0 billion for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

 
RSUs granted are deducted from the shares available for grant under the Companys stock option plans utilizing a factor
of two times the number of RSUs granted. Similarly, RSUs cancelled are added back to the shares available for grant under the Companys stock option plans utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs cancelled. Outstanding RSU balances
are not included in the outstanding options balances in the stock option activity table.

Stock-Based Compensation

 
Stock-based compensation cost for RSUs is measured based on the closing fair market value of the Companys common
stock on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation cost for stock options and employee stock purchase plan rights (stock purchase rights) is estimated at the grant date and offering date, respectively, based on the fair-value as
calculated by the BSM option-pricing model. The BSM option-pricing model incorporates various assumptions including expected volatility, expected life and interest rates. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the
Companys common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Companys stock options and other relevant factors including implied volatility in market traded options on the Companys common
stock. The Company bases its expected life assumption on its historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards it grants to employees. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation cost as expense ratably on a straight-line
basis over the requisite service period. 
 
The weighted-average assumptions used for stock options granted do not apply to
employee stock options assumed in conjunction with business acquisitions during the year ended September 25, 2010. The weighted-average fair value of stock options assumed during the year ended September 25, 2010 was $216.82. There were no
stock options assumed during 2009 and 2008. The weighted-average assumptions used for the three years ended September 25, 2010, and the resulting estimates of weighted-average fair value per share of options granted and of stock purchase rights
during those periods are as follows:

Stock-based compensation expense capitalized as software development costs was not significant as of
September 25, 2010 or September 26, 2009. The income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation expense was $314 million, $266 million and $169 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The total unrecognized compensation cost
related to stock options and RSUs expected to vest was $1.9 billion as of September 25, 2010, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.73 years. 
 
Note 8  Commitments and Contingencies 
 
Lease Commitments 


The Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company
does not currently utilize any other off-balance sheet financing arrangements. The

Table of Contents



major facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms not exceeding five additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms
ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are for ten years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of September 25, 2010, the Companys total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were
$2.1 billion, of which $1.7 billion related to leases for retail space. 
 
Rent expense under all operating leases, including
both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $271 million, $231 million and $207 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of one year as of
September 25, 2010, are as follows (in millions):

Accrued Warranty and Indemnifications 
 
The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period for hardware products is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. The
Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the Companys hardware products. The Company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product warranties at the time
related revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical and projected warranty claim rates,
historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Companys typical experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its pre-existing warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as
necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates. 
 
The Company periodically provides updates to its
applications and system software to maintain the softwares compliance with published specifications. The estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for as warranty costs that are recognized at the time related software revenue is
recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units delivered, the number of updates expected to occur, and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary
to develop these updates. 
 
The following table reconciles changes in the Companys accrued warranty and related costs for
the three years ended September 25, 2010 (in millions):

The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against
legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by 


 
 
76 






Table of Contents



the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an
indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a
potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results. Therefore, the Company did not record a liability for infringement costs as
of either September 25, 2010 or September 26, 2009. 
 
The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with
its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to
advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited
history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. However, the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations, and payments made
under these agreements historically have not materially adversely affected the Companys financial condition or operating results. 


Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product 


Although most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components
including but not limited to microprocessors, enclosures, certain liquid crystal displays (LCDs), certain optical drives and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are currently obtained by the Company from single
or limited sources, which subjects the Company to significant supply and pricing risks. Many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources including but not limited to NAND flash memory, dynamic random access memory
(DRAM) and certain LCDs, are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. In addition, the Company has entered into certain agreements for the supply of key components including but not
limited to microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs at favorable pricing, but there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar favorable terms, or at all, upon expiration or otherwise obtain
favorable pricing in the future. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and/or price increases that can materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. 


The Company and other participants in the personal computer, and mobile communication and media device industries also compete for
various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. In addition, the Company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries, and new products introduced by the Company
often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the
Companys supply of a key single-sourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, if such components were available only at significantly higher prices, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed
products to the Company, the Companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Companys business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to
obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided
to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements. 


Substantially all of the Companys Macs, iPhones, iPads, iPods, logic boards and other assembled products are now manufactured by
outsourcing partners, primarily in various parts of Asia. A significant concentration of this outsourced manufacturing is currently performed by only a few outsourcing partners of the Company, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing
partners are the sole-sourced supplier of components and manufacturing outsourcing for many of the Companys key products including but not limited to final assembly 


 
 
77 






Table of Contents



of substantially all of the Companys Macs, iPhones, iPads and iPods. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Companys
operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The Companys purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. 


Long-Term Supply Agreements 
 
The Company has entered into prepaid long-term supply agreements to secure the supply of certain inventory components, which generally expire between 2011 and 2015. As of September 25, 2010, the
Company had a total of $956 million of inventory component prepayments outstanding, of which $157 million is classified as other current assets and $799 million is classified as other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In August 2010, the
Company entered into a long-term supply agreement under which it has committed to prepay $500 million in 2011. The Company had a total of $1.2 billion of inventory component prepayments outstanding as of September 26, 2009. These prepayments
will be applied to certain inventory component purchases made over the life of each respective agreement. 
 
Contingencies 


The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully
adjudicated, which are discussed in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading Legal Proceedings. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and
claims that would individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results. However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. If the Company failed to prevail in any of
these legal matters or if several of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. 


On March 14, 2008, 
Mirror Worlds, LLC 
filed an action against the Company alleging that certain of its products infringed on
three patents covering technology used to display files. On October 1, 2010, a jury returned a verdict against the Company, and awarded damages of $208 million per patent for each of the three patents asserted. The Company is challenging
the verdict, believes it has valid defenses and has not recorded a loss contingency at this time. 
 
Production and marketing of
products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental, product safety and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life,
and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including various countries within Europe and Asia and
certain states and provinces within North America. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws
or future laws will not materially adversely affect the Companys financial condition or operating results. 
 
Note 9
 

Segment Information and Geographic Data 
 
The Company reports segment information based on the management
approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Companys reportable segments. 


The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. Accordingly, the Company determined its operating and reporting
segments, which are generally based on the nature and location of its customers, to be the Americas, Europe, Japan, Asia-Pacific and Retail operations. The Americas, Europe, Japan and Asia-Pacific reportable segment results do not include results of
the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries, as well as the Middle East and 


 
 
78 






Table of Contents



Africa. The Asia-Pacific segment includes Australia and Asia, but does not include Japan. The Retail segment operates Apple retail stores in 11 countries, including the U.S. Each reportable
operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. 


The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic
segments are generally based on the location of customers, while Retail segment net sales are based on sales from the Companys retail stores. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and
operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain
expenses managed outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses, such as manufacturing costs and variances not included in standard costs, research and development, corporate marketing
expenses, stock-based compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges, and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting
purposes. Segment assets exclude corporate assets, such as cash, short-term and long-term investments, manufacturing and corporate facilities, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets. Except for the
Retail segment, capital asset purchases for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment. Cash payments for capital asset purchases by the Retail segment were $392 million, $369 million and $389 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively. 
 
The Company has certain retail stores that have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to
promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Companys more typical retail
stores. The Company allocates certain operating expenses associated with its high-profile stores to corporate marketing expense to reflect the estimated Company-wide benefit. The allocation of these operating costs to corporate expense is based on
the amount incurred for a high-profile store in excess of that incurred by a more typical Company retail location. The Company had opened a total of 15 high-profile stores as of September 25, 2010. Amounts allocated to corporate expense
resulting from the operations of high-profile stores were $75 million, $65 million and $53 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Report of Ernst & Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 


The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Apple Inc. 
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September 25, 2010 and September 26, 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders equity and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Apple Inc. at September 25, 2010 and September 26, 2009, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Apple Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of September 25, 2010, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control  Integrated Framework
 issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated October 27, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of
Ernst & Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Apple Inc.

 
We have audited Apple Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of September 25, 2010, based on criteria
established in 
Internal Control  Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Apple Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 


We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
A companys
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 


Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 


In our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
September 25, 2010, based on the COSO criteria. 
 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the 2010 consolidated financial statements of Apple Inc. and our report dated October 27, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


Nature of Operations 

Apple Computer (the "Company") designs, manufactures, and markets 
microprocessor-based personal computers and related personal computing 
products for sale primarily to education, home, business, and government 
customers.

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple 
Computer, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company).  Intercompany 
accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  The Company's fiscal 
year-end is the last Friday in September.

Accounting Estimates

General
The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity 
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to 
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these 
consolidated  financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results 
could differ materially from those estimates.

Significant Accounting Estimates
Reserves Against Inventories
The Company's reserves against inventories are based on the Company's 
best estimates of product sales prices and customer demand patterns, 
and/or its plans to transition its products.  However, the Company 
participates in a highly competitive industry that is characterized by 
aggressive pricing practices, downward pressures on gross margins, 
frequent introductions of new products, short product life cycles, rapid 
technological advances, continual improvement in product 
price/performance characteristics, and price sensitivity and changing 
demand patterns on the part of consumers.  As a result of the industry's 
ever-changing and dynamic nature, it is at least reasonably possible that 
the estimates used by the Company to determine its reserves against 
inventories will be materially different from the actual amounts or results.  
These differences could result in materially higher than expected inventory 
reserve costs, which could have a materially adverse effect on the 
Company's results of operations and financial condition in the near term.

Warranty and Related Accruals
The Company's warranty and related accruals are based on the Company's 
best estimates of product failure rates and unit costs to repair.  However, 
the Company is continually releasing new and ever-more complex and 
technologically advanced products.  As a result, it is at least reasonably 
possible that product could be released with certain unknown quality 
and/or design problems.  Such an occurrence could result in materially 
higher than expected warranty and related costs, which could have a 
materially adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and 
financial condition in the near term.

Deferred Tax Assets
Realization of approximately $85 million of the total deferred tax assets is 
dependent on the Company's ability to generate approximately $245 
million of future U.S. taxable income.  Management believes that it is 
more likely than not that the asset will be realized based on forecasted U.S. 
income.   However, there can be no assurance that the Company will meet 
its expectations of future U.S. income.  As a result, the amount of the 
deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in the near and 
long term if estimates of future taxable U.S. income are reduced.  Such an 
occurrence could materially adversely affect the Company's results of 
operations and financial condition.  The Company will continue to 
evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing 
the need for a valuation allowance.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Financial Instruments 
Investments
All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the 
date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents; investments with 
maturities between three and twelve months are considered to be short-
term investments.  There are no investments with maturities greater than 
twelve months.  The Company's cash equivalents consist primarily of U.S. 
Government securities, Euro-dollar deposits, and commercial paper.  
Short-term investments consist principally of Euro-dollar deposits and 
commercial paper.  The Company's cash equivalents and short-term 
investments are generally held until maturity.  The Company's marketable 
equity securities consist of securities issued by U.S. corporations and are 
included in "Other assets" on the accompanying balance sheets. 

Management determines the appropriate classification of its debt and 
marketable equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such 
designation as of each balance sheet date.  The Company's debt and 
marketable equity securities have been classified and accounted for as 
available-for-sale.  These securities are carried at fair value, with the 
unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of 
shareholders' equity.  These unrealized gains or losses include any 
unrealized losses and gains on interest rate contracts accounted for as 
hedges against the available-for-sale securities.  Equity securities that are 
not considered marketable as defined are carried at cost.  Realized gains 
and losses on the sale of securities are included in interest and other 
income (expense), net.  The cost of securities sold is based on the specific 
identification method. 

Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk
In the ordinary course of business and as part of the Company's asset and 
liability management, the Company enters into various types of 
transactions that involve contracts and financial instruments with off-
balance-sheet risk.  These instruments are entered into in order to manage 
financial market risk, primarily interest rate and foreign exchange risk.  
The Company enters into these financial instruments with major 
international financial institutions utilizing over-the-counter as opposed to 
exchange traded instruments.  The Company does not hold or transact in 
financial instruments for purposes other than risk management. 

Gains and losses on accounting hedges of existing assets or liabilities are 
recorded currently in income or shareholder's equity against the losses and 
gains on the hedged transactions.  Gains and losses related to qualifying 
accounting hedges of firmly committed or probable but not firmly 
committed transactions are deferred until the occurrence of the hedged 
transactions.  Gains and losses on interest rate and foreign exchange 
contracts that do not qualify as accounting hedges are recorded currently in 
income.

The Company monitors its interest rate and foreign exchange positions 
daily based on applicable and commonly used pricing models.  The 
correlation between the changes in the fair value of hedging instruments 
and the changes in the underlying hedged items is assessed periodically 
over the life of the hedged instrument.  In the event that it is determined 
that a hedge is ineffective, the Company recognizes in income the change 
in market value of the instrument beginning on the date it was no longer an 
effective hedge.  

Interest Rate Derivatives
The Company enters into interest rate derivative transactions, including 
interest rate swaps, collars, and floors, with financial institutions in order
to better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its cash 
equivalents and short-term investments with the fixed-rate interest expense 
of its long-term debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the Company's 
exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates.   The 
Company may also enter into interest rate contracts that are intended to 
reduce the cost of the interest rate risk management program.

In addition, the Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to 
hedge certain intercompany loan transactions.  These forward contracts 
effectively change certain foreign currency denominated debt into U.S. 
dollar denominated debt, which better matches against the Company's U.S. 
dollar denominated cash equivalents and short-term investments. 

				31




Foreign Currency Instruments
The Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts 
with financial institutions primarily to protect against currency exchange 
risks associated with certain firmly committed and certain other probable 
but not firmly committed transactions.  The Company's foreign exchange 
risk management policy requires it to hedge a majority of its existing 
material foreign exchange transaction exposures.  However, the Company 
may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures that are 
immaterial either in terms of their minimal U.S. dollar value or in terms of 
their historically high correlation with the U.S. dollar.   

Probable but not firmly committed transactions comprise sales of the 
Company's products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.  A majority of 
these non-U.S. dollar-based sales are made through the Company's 
subsidiaries in Europe, Asia (particularly Japan), Canada, and Australia.  
The Company also purchases foreign exchange option contracts to hedge 
certain other probable but not firmly committed transactions.  The 
Company also sells foreign exchange option contracts, in order to partially 
finance the purchase of foreign exchange option contracts used to hedge 
both firmly committed and certain other probable but not firmly committed 
transactions.  In addition, the Company enters into other foreign exchange 
transactions, which are intended to reduce the costs associated with its 
foreign exchange risk management programs.  The duration of foreign 
exchange hedging instruments, whether for firmly committed transactions 
or for probable but not firmly committed transactions, currently does not 
exceed one year.

For further information regarding the Company's accounting treatment of 
its financial instruments, refer to pages 33 - 36 of the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. If
the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are made 
currently for the difference between the cost and the market value.

Property, Plant, and Equipment
Property, plant, and equipment is stated at cost.  Depreciation and 
amortization is computed by use of the declining balance and straight-line 
methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets.

Long-Lived Assets
Effective September 30, 1995, the Company adopted Financial Accounting 
Standard No. 121 ("FAS 121"), "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-
Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of."  In 
accordance with FAS 121, prior period financial statements have not been 
restated to reflect this change in accounting principle and the cumulative 
effect of this change was not material. 

Stock-Based Compensation
The Company has not elected early adoption of Financial Accounting 
Standard No. 123 ("FAS 123"), "Accounting for Stock-Based 
Compensation."  FAS 123 becomes effective for the Company in 1997, 
and will have no impact on the Company's results of operations and 
financial condition as the Company has elected to continue measuring 
compensation expense for its stock-based employee compensation plans 
using the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25, 
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees."  However, the Company will 
provide pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if 
the fair value-based method prescribed by FAS 123 had been applied in 
measuring compensation expense.

Foreign Currency Translation  
The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its foreign sales 
subsidiaries at year-end exchange rates.  Gains and losses from these 
translations are credited or charged to "accumulated translation 
adjustment" included in shareholders' equity.  The foreign manufacturing 
and certain other entities use the U.S. dollar as the functional currency and 
translate monetary assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates, and 
inventories, property, and non-monetary assets and liabilities at historical  
rates.  Gains and losses from these translations are included in the results 
of operations and are immaterial.  

				32




Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue at the time products are shipped.  
Provisions are made currently for estimated product returns and price 
protection that may occur under Company programs.  Historically, actual 
amounts recorded for product returns and price protection have not varied 
significantly from estimated amounts. 

Warranty Expense
The Company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be 
incurred under product warranties when products are shipped.

Advertising Costs 
Advertising costs are charged to expense the first time the advertising 
takes place. 

Earnings (Loss) per Share
Earnings (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average number 
of common shares outstanding and (in 1995 and 1994 only) the dilutive 
effect of common stock options using the treasury stock method.  Common 
stock options, the convertible subordinated notes, and certain common 
shares issued pending shareholder approval were not included in the 
computation of loss per share in 1996 as their effect was antidilutive.
 
Reclassifications
Certain prior year amounts in the Industry Segment and Geographic 
Information footnote have been reclassified to conform to the current 
year's presentation.

The gross realized gains recorded to earnings on sales of available-for-sale 
securities, as well as the related cash proceeds from those sales, were $15 
million and $1 million in 1996 and 1995, respectively.  There were no 
gross realized losses recorded to earnings on sales of available-for-sale 
securities in 1996 or 1995.

The Company's cash and cash equivalent balance at September 27, 1996, 
includes $177 million pledged primarily as collateral to support letters of 
credit, and at September 29, 1995, includes $90 million pledged as 
collateral to support notes payable to banks.

Interest Rate Derivatives and Foreign Currency Instruments
The table on page 35 shows the notional principal, fair value, and credit 
risk amounts of the Company's interest rate derivative and foreign 
currency instruments as of September 27, 1996, and September 29, 1995.  
The notional principal amounts for off-balance-sheet instruments provide 
one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of year end, and do 
not represent the amount of the Company's exposure to credit or market 
loss.  The credit risk amount shown in the table below represents the 
Company's gross exposure to potential accounting loss on these 
transactions if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of
the contract, based on then-current currency exchange and interest rates at 
each respective date.  The Company's exposure to credit loss and market 
risk will vary over time as a function of interest rates and currency 
exchange rates. 

The estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used 
pricing models using prevailing financial market information as of 
September 27, 1996, and September 29, 1995.  In certain instances where 
judgment is required in estimating fair value, price quotes were obtained 
from several of the Company's counterparty financial institutions.  
Although the table below reflects the notional principal, fair value, and 
credit risk amounts of the Company's interest rate and foreign exchange 
instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the 
exposures and transactions that the interest rate and foreign exchange 
instruments are intended to hedge.  The amounts ultimately realized upon 
settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses 
on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions 
during the remaining life of the instruments.

The interest rate swaps generally require the Company to pay a floating 
interest rate based on the three- or six-month U.S. dollar LIBOR and 
receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of the underlying 
notional amounts.  As a result, these swaps effectively convert the 
Company's fixed-rate ten-year debt to floating-rate debt and generally 
qualify for hedge accounting treatment.  Maturity dates for these swaps 
currently range from one to seven years.  At September 27, 1996, and 
September 29, 1995, interest rate swaps classified as receive-fixed swaps 
had weighted average receive rates of  6.04% and 5.89%, respectively.  
Weighted average pay rates on these swaps were 5.82% and 5.88% at 
September 27, 1996, and September 29, 1995, respectively.  The 
unrealized gains and losses on these swaps are generally deferred and 
recognized in income in the same period as the hedged transaction.  
Deferred losses on such contracts totaled approximately $13 million and 
$9 million at September 27, 1996, and September 29, 1995, respectively.

Interest rate collars limit the Company's exposure to fluctuations in short-
term interest rates by locking in a range of interest rates. An interest rate
collar is a no-cost structure that consists of a purchased option and a sold
option. The Company receives a payment when the three-month LIBOR 
falls below predetermined levels, and makes a payment when the three-
month LIBOR rises above predetermined levels. The entire structure 
generally qualifies as an accounting hedge.  Purchased floors limit the 
Company's exposure to falling interest rates on its cash equivalents and 
short-term investments by locking in a minimum interest rate.  The 
Company receives a payment when interest rates fall below a 
predetermined level.  A purchased floor generally qualifies for hedge 
accounting treatment and is reported on the balance sheet at its premium 
cost, which is amortized over the life of the floor.  The interest rate collars
and purchased floors are generally designated and effective as hedges 
against interest rate risk on the Company's debt securities classified as 
available-for-sale and are carried at fair value as an adjustment to the basis
of the underlying security.  The related unrealized gains and losses,net of 
taxes, are reported as a component of shareholders' equity and are 
recognized in income in the same period as the hedged transaction.  
Unrealized gains and losses on such contracts were immaterial at 
September 27, 1996, and September 29, 1995. 



				35





Interest rate option contracts require the Company to make payments 
should certain interest rates either fall below or rise above predetermined 
levels.  These contracts are generally not accounted for as hedges and are 
carried at fair value with gains and losses recorded currently in income as a 
component of interest and other income (expense), net.

The foreign exchange forward contracts not accounted for as hedges are 
carried at fair value with gains and losses recorded currently in income as a 
component of interest and other income (expense), net.  The foreign 
exchange forward contracts that are designated and effective as hedges are 
also carried at fair value with gains and losses recorded currently in 
income as a component of interest and other income (expense), net, against 
the losses and gains on the hedged transactions.  All foreign exchange 
forward contracts expire within one year.

The premium costs of purchased foreign exchange option contracts that are 
designated and effective as hedges are amortized over the life of the 
option.  If the option contract is designated and effective as a hedge of a 
firmly committed transaction, or a probable but not firmly committed 
transaction, then any gain or loss is deferred until the occurrence of the 
hedged transaction.  Deferred gains and losses on such contracts were 
immaterial at September 27, 1996, and September 29, 1995.  If the option 
contract is used to hedge an asset or liability, then the hedge is carried at
fair value with gains or losses recorded currently in income as a 
component of interest and other income (expense), net, against the losses 
or gains on the hedged transaction.  As of September 27, 1996, maturity 
dates for purchased foreign exchange option contracts ranged from one to 
twelve months.

The purchased and sold foreign exchange option contracts not accounted 
for as hedges are carried at fair value with gains and losses recorded 
currently in income as a component of interest and other income 
(expense), net.  As of September 27, 1996, maturity dates for sold option 
contracts ranged from one to six months.

The Company monitors its interest rate and foreign exchange positions 
daily based on applicable and commonly used pricing models.  The 
correlation between the changes in the fair value of hedging instruments 
and the changes in the underlying hedged items is assessed periodically 
over the life of the hedged instrument.  In the event that it is determined 
that a hedge is ineffective, the Company recognizes in income the change 
in market value of the instrument beginning on the date it was no longer an 
effective hedge.  

Notes Payable to Banks

The weighted average interest rates for Japanese yen-denominated notes 
payable to banks at September 27, 1996, and September 29, 1995, were 
approximately 1.3% and 2.2%, respectively.  The Company had no U.S. 
dollar-denominated notes payable to banks at September 27, 1996.  The 
weighted average interest rate for U.S. dollar-denominated notes payable 
to banks at September 29, 1995, was approximately 6.2%.

The carrying amount of notes payable to banks approximates their fair 
value due to their short-term maturities.


				36




  

Long-Term Debt
During 1996, the Company issued $661 million aggregate principal 
amount of 6% unsecured convertible subordinated notes (the "Notes") to 
certain qualified parties in a private placement.  The Notes were sold at 
100% of par.  The Notes pay interest semi-annually and mature on June 1, 
2001.  The Notes are convertible by their holders at any time after 
September 5, 1996 at a conversion price of $29.205 per share subject to 
adjustments as defined in the Note agreement.  The Notes are redeemable 
by the Company at 102.4% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest, 
for the twelve-month period beginning June 1, 1999, and at 101.2% of the 
principal amount, plus accrued interest, for the twelve-month period 
beginning June 1, 2000.  The Notes are subordinated to all present and 
future senior indebtedness of the Company as defined in the Note 
agreement.  In addition, the Company incurred approximately $15 million 
of costs associated with the issuance of the Notes.  These costs are 
accounted for as a deduction from the face amount of the Notes and are 
being amortized over the life of the Notes.  In October 1996, the Company 
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission $569 million of 
the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, including the related common 
shares issuable upon conversion of these Notes.

During 1994, the Company issued $300 million aggregate principal 
amount of 6.5% unsecured notes in a public offering registered with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission.  The notes were sold at 99.925% of 
par, for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%.  The notes pay interest 
semi-annually and mature on February 15, 2004.   

The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company's long-
term debt are as follows:

The fair value of the ten-year unsecured notes is based on their listed 
market value as of September 27, 1996.  The fair value of the convertible 
subordinated notes is based on estimates from several financial 
institutions.

Concentrations of Risk

Concentrations of Credit Risk

The Company distributes its products principally through third-party 
computer resellers and various education and consumer channels.  
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited 
because of flooring arrangements for selected customers with third-party 
financing companies and because the Company's customer base consists of 
large numbers of geographically diverse customers dispersed across 
several industries.  As such, the Company generally does not require 
collateral from its customers.  

The counterparties to the agreements relating to the Company's 
investments and foreign exchange and interest rate instruments consist of a 
number of major international financial institutions.  To date, no such 
counterparty has failed to meet its financial obligations to the Company.  
The Company does not believe that there is significant risk of 
nonperformance by these counterparties because the Company continually 
monitors its positions and the credit ratings of such counterparties, and 
limits the financial exposure and the number of agreements and contracts it 
enters into with any one party.  The Company generally does not require 
collateral from counterparties, except for margin agreements associated 
with the ten-year interest rate swaps on the Company's ten-year unsecured 
notes.  To mitigate the credit risk associated with these ten-year swap 
transactions, the Company entered into margining agreements with its 
third-party bank counterparties.  Margining under these agreements does 
not start until 1997.  Furthermore, these agreements would require the 
Company or the counterparty to post margin only if certain credit risk 
thresholds were exceeded.

Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product

Although certain components essential to the Company's business are 
generally available from multiple sources, other key components 
(including microprocessors and application-specific integrated circuits, or 
"ASICs") are currently obtained by the Company from single sources.  If 
the supply of a key single-sourced component to the Company were to be 
delayed or curtailed, the Company's ability to ship the related product 
utilizing such component in desired quantities and in a timely manner 
could be adversely affected, depending on the time required to obtain 
sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain 
sufficient quantities from an alternate source.  In addition, the Company 
uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal 
computer industry.  Continued availability of these components may be 
affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of 
common components instead of components customized to meet the 
Company's requirements.  Finally, a significant portion of the Company's 
CPUs and logic boards are now manufactured by SCI Systems, Inc. 
("SCI").  Although the Company works closely with SCI on manufacturing 
schedules and levels, the Company's operating results could be adversely 
affected if SCI were unable to meet its production obligations.

Significant Customers

No customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company's net sales in

Advertising expense was $183 million, $205 million, and $158 million for 
1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively.

Restructuring of Operations

In the second quarter of 1996, the Company announced and began to 
implement a restructuring plan aimed at reducing costs and restoring 
profitability to the Company's operations.  The restructuring plan was 
necessitated by decreased demand for Company products and the 
Company's adoption of a new strategic direction.  The Company's 
restructuring actions consist primarily of terminating approximately 1,500 
full-time employees (down from an initial planned termination of 
approximately 2,800), approximately 900 of whom have been terminated 
through September 27, 1996, excluding employees who were hired by SCI 
Systems, Inc. and MCI Systemhouse, the purchasers of the Company's 
Fountain, Colorado, manufacturing facility and the Napa, California, data 
center facility, respectively);canceling or vacating certain facility leases as
a result of these employee terminations; writing down certain land, 
buildings and equipment to be sold as a result of downsizing operations 
and outsourcing various operational functions; and canceling contracts as a 
result of terminating eWorld, Apple's on-line service.  These actions 
resulted in an initial charge of $207 million.  The charge was adjusted 
downward by $28 million in the fourth quarter of 1996, primarily as a 
result of greater than expected voluntary terminations, which led to fewer 
than planned involuntary terminations, as well as lower than expected 
costs to cancel or vacate certain facility leases, partially offset by greater
than expected costs to cancel certain contracts and to write down certain
operating assets sold or to be sold.  The restructuring actions have resulted
in cash expenditures of $55 million and noncash asset write-downs of $7 
million through September 27, 1996.  The Company expects that the 
remaining $117 million accrued balance at September 27, 1996, will result 
in cash expenditures of approximately $60 million over the next twelve 
months and approximately $10 million thereafter.  The Company expects 
that most of the contemplated restructuring actions will be completed 
within the next six months and will be financed through current working 
capital and continued short-term borrowings.  

The following table depicts the restructuring activity through September 
27, 1996:

In the third quarter of 1993, the Company initiated a plan to restructure its
operations worldwide in order to address the competitive conditions in the 
personal computer industry.  In connection with this plan, the Company 
recorded a $321 million charge to operating expenses.  In 1995 and 1994, 
the Company lowered its estimate of the total costs associated with this 
restructuring and recorded an adjustment that increased income by $23 
million and $127 million, respectively.  These adjustments primarily 
reflected the modification or cancelation of certain elements of the 
Company's original restructuring plan because of changing business and 
economic conditions that made certain elements of the restructuring plan 
financially less attractive than originally anticipated.  In addition, some 
actions were completed at a lower cost than originally estimated.

Income Taxes			
			
The provision (benefit) for income taxes consists of
the following:						(In millions)

Provision (benefit) for
income taxes			$(479)     	$ 250   	$ 190


			
The foreign provision (benefit) for income taxes is based on foreign pretax 
earnings (loss) of approximately $(141) million, $572 million, and $474 
million in 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively.  A substantial portion of the 
Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments is held by 
foreign subsidiaries and is generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated 
holdings.  Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries would be subject to U.S. 
income taxation on repatriation to the United States.  The Company's 
financial statements fully provide for any related tax liability on amounts 
that may be repatriated, aside from undistributed earnings of certain of the 
Company's foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be indefinitely 
reinvested in operations outside the United States.  U.S. income taxes have 
not been provided on a cumulative total of $395 million of such earnings.  
It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that might be 
incurred if these earnings were to be distributed.  Except for such 
indefinitely reinvested earnings, the Company provides for federal and 
state income taxes currently on undistributed earnings of foreign 
subsidiaries. 


				40



Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the future income tax effects of
temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of 
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are 
measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years 
in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or 
settled.   

At September 27, 1996, and September 29, 1995, the significant 
components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities were:

At September 27, 1996, the Company had operating loss carryforwards for 
tax purposes of approximately $273 million, which expire principally in 
2011.  Substantially all of the remaining benefits from tax losses and 
credits do not expire.  

The net change in the total valuation allowance was negligible in 1996 and 
an increase of $3 million in 1995.   

A reconciliation of the provision (benefit) for income taxes, with the 
amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate  (35% 
in 1996, 1995, and 1994) to income (loss) before provision (benefit) for 
income taxes, is as follows:

The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has proposed federal income tax 
deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company has made 
certain prepayments thereon.  The Company contested the proposed 
deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1988, and most of the issues in 
dispute for these years have been resolved.  On June 29, 1995, the IRS 
issued a notice of deficiency proposing increases to the amount of the 
Company's federal income taxes for the years 1989 through 1991.  The 
Company has filed a petition with the United States Tax Court to contest 
these alleged tax deficiencies.  Management believes that adequate 
provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from these 
tax examinations.

Common Stock

Shareholder Rights Plan

In May 1989, the Company adopted a shareholder rights plan and 
distributed a dividend of one right to purchase one share of common stock 
(a "Right") for each outstanding share of common stock of the Company.  
The Rights become exercisable in certain limited circumstances involving 
a potential business combination transaction of the Company and are 
initially exercisable at a price of $200 per share.  Following certain other 
events after the Rights have become exercisable, each Right entitles its 
holder to purchase for $200 an amount of common stock of the Company, 
or, in certain circumstances, securities of the acquiror, having a then-
current market value of two times the exercise price of the Right. The 
Rights are redeemable and may be amended at the Company's option 
before they become exercisable.  Until a Right is exercised, the holder of a 
Right, as such, has no rights as a shareholder of the Company.  The Rights 
expire on April 19, 1999.

Stock Option Plans

The Company has in effect a 1990 Stock Option Plan (the "1990 Plan").  
The 1981 Stock Option Plan terminated in October 1990 and the 1987 
Executive Long Term Stock Option Plan (the "1987 Plan") terminated in 
July 1995.  Options granted before those plan termination dates remain 
outstanding in accordance with their terms.  Options may be granted under 
the 1990 Plan to employees, including officers and directors who are 
employees, at not less than the fair market value on the date of grant.  
These options generally become exercisable over a period of three years, 
based on continued employment, and generally expire ten years after the 
grant date.  The 1990 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, 
nonstatutory stock options, and stock appreciation rights.

In December 1996, the Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the 
1990 Plan to increase the number of shares reserved for issuance by 1 
million, subject to shareholder approval at the Company's Annual Meeting 
of Shareholders scheduled for February 1997.  In July 1995, the Board of 
Directors adopted an amendment to the 1990 Plan to increase the number 
of shares reserved for issuance by 8.6 million.  In December 1995, the 
Board of Directors adopted a new amendment to reduce this increase to 4.2 
million shares.  This new amendment was approved by the Company's 
shareholders in January 1996.  Also in July 1995, the Board of Directors 
resolved to terminate the 1987 Plan and transfer all unused shares 
remaining under the 1987 Plan to the 1990 Plan.  This resolution was 
approved by the Company's shareholders in January 1996.

In March 1996, the Board of Directors approved the issuance of options to 
purchase 1 million shares of common stock to the Chief Executive Officer 
of the Company, subject to shareholder approval at the Company's Annual 
Meeting of Shareholders scheduled for February 1997.  These options will 
have an exercise price of $26.25 per share and will become exercisable 
over five years.  As the issuance of these options is pending shareholder 
approval, they are not included as outstanding in the table below. 

On May 14, 1996, the Board of Directors adopted a resolution allowing 
employees up to and including the level of Vice President to exchange 
1.25 options at their existing option price for 1.0 new options having an 
exercise price of $26.375 per share, the fair market value of the Company's 
common stock at May 29, 1996.  Options received under this program are 
subject to one year of additional vesting such that the new vesting date for 
each vesting portion will be the later of May 29, 1997, and the original 
vesting date plus one year.  Approximately 2.9 million options were 
exchanged under this program.

Summarized information regarding the Company's stock option plans as of 
September 27, 1996, is as follows:

Restricted Stock Plan

On April 1, 1993, the Company's Board of Directors approved a Restricted 
Stock Plan for officers of the Company (the "RSP"), which became 
effective July 1, 1993.  The RSP was subsequently ratified by the 
shareholders on January 26, 1994.  The RSP is designed to provide an 
incentive for officers to continue to own shares of the Company's common 
stock acquired upon exercise of options under any of the Company's stock 
option plans, thus more closely aligning officers' financial interests with 
those of the shareholders.  The RSP provides that officers who exercise 
stock options and continue to hold the exercised shares for at least three 
years will receive up to three awards of shares of restricted stock.  Each 
such award is for one-third the number of shares held for the requisite 
retention period.  Each restricted stock award granted pursuant to the plan 
becomes fully vested three years after the grant date, provided that the 
officer maintains continuous employment with the Company and that other 
vesting requirements are met.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Company has an employee stock purchase plan (the "Purchase Plan") 
under which substantially all employees may purchase common stock 
through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair 
market values as of the beginning and end of the offering period.  Stock 
purchases under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of an employee's 
compensation, up to a maximum of $25,000 in any calendar year.  As of 
September 27, 1996, approximately 400,000 shares were reserved for 
future issuance under the Purchase Plan.  In December 1996, the Board of 
Directors adopted an amendment to the Purchase Plan to increase the 
number of shares reserved for issuance by 3.5 million, subject to 
shareholder approval at the Company's Annual Meeting of Shareholders 
scheduled for February 1997.  In July 1995, the Board of Directors 
adopted an amendment to the Purchase Plan to increase the number of 
shares reserved for issuance by 3 million.  In December 1995, the Board of 
Directors adopted a new amendment to reduce this increase to 1.5 million 
shares.  This new amendment was approved by the Company's 
shareholders in January 1996.

Chief Executive Officer Performance Shares

In February of 1996, the Board of Directors approved the issuance of up to 
1 million shares of common stock (the "Performance Shares") to the Chief 
Executive Officer of the Company, subject to shareholder approval at the 
Company's Annual Meeting of Shareholders scheduled for February 1997.  
The Company may issue up to 200,000 Performance Shares for each full 
fiscal year during the five-year term of the Chief Executive Officer's 
employment agreement, which began on February 2, 1996. For each partial 
fiscal year during the term of this agreement, the number of shares that 
may be issued shall be prorated to reflect that partial year.  The issuance of
the Performance Shares is subject to the achievement of certain 
performance goals established by the Board of Directors at the beginning 
of the employment agreement and at the beginning of each subsequent 
fiscal year during the term of the employment agreement.  As these 
Performance Shares are pending shareholder approval, they are not 
included as outstanding on the accompanying balance sheet.  However, the 
related estimated compensation expense is included in the 1996 results of 
operations and is immaterial.  The Performance Shares for years after 1996 
will become part of the Senior Officers Restricted Performance Share Plan 
(refer to discussion below) upon approval of the Senior Officers Restricted 
Performance Share Plan by the Company's shareholders at the Annual 
Meeting of Shareholders scheduled for February 1997.

				43



Senior Officers Restricted Performance Share Plan

In December 1996, the Company's Board of Directors approved a Senior 
Officers Restricted Performance Share Plan (the "Performance Share 
Plan") for which officers of the Company at the level of Senior Vice 
President and above, and other key employees as recommended by 
management and designated by the Compensation Committee of the 
Board, will be eligible.  The Performance Share Plan provides for a grant 
of shares to each eligible participant, with annual vesting conditioned on 
the achievement of performance goals established in advance by the 
Compensation Committee and subject to such other terms as may be 
determined by the Committee.  The Performance Share Plan is intended to 
provide an incentive for superior performance, to promote the maintenance 
of substantial stock ownership levels by officers of the Corporation, and to 
enable the Corporation to attract and retain highly qualified executive 
officers.  The Company's Board of Directors has reserved 2 million shares 
for issuance under the provisions of the Performance Share Plan.  The 
Performance Share Plan is subject to shareholder approval at the Annual 
Meeting of Shareholders scheduled for February 1997.

Stock Repurchase Programs

In November 1992, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 
10 million shares of the Company's common stock in the open market.    
Approximately 6.6 million shares remain authorized for repurchase.  No 
shares were repurchased under this authorization in 1996, 1995, or 1994.

Employee Savings Plan

The Company has an employee savings plan (the "Savings Plan") that 
qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the 
Internal Revenue Code.  Under the Savings Plan, participating U.S. 
employees may defer a portion of their pretax earnings, up to the Internal 
Revenue Service annual contribution limit ($9,500 for calendar year 1996).  
Effective October 1, 1995, the Company matches 50% to 100% of each 
employee's contributions, depending on length of service, up to a 
maximum 6% of the employee's earnings.  Prior to October 1, 1995, the 
Company matched 30% to 70% of each employee's contributions, 
depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employee's 
earnings.  The Company's matching contributions to the Savings Plan were 
approximately $22 million, $15 million, and $11 million in 1996, 1995, 
and 1994,  respectively. 

Commitments and Contingencies

Lease Commitments

The Company leases various facilities and equipment under noncancelable 
operating lease arrangements.  The major facilities leases are for terms of 
five to ten years and generally provide renewal options for terms of up to 
five additional years.  Rent expense under all operating leases was 
approximately $129 million, $127 million, and $122 million  in 1996, 
1995, and 1994, respectively.  Future minimum lease payments under 
these noncancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of 
one year as of September 27, 1996, are as follows:

Total minimum lease payments	$188  


Purchase Commitment

In connection with the sale of its Fountain, Colorado, manufacturing 
facility to SCI Systems, Inc. ("SCI"), the Company is obligated to purchase 
certain percentages of its total annual volumes of CPUs and logic boards 
from SCI over each of the next three years.   The Company has met these 
obligations through September 27, 1996, and believes it will meet them in 
the future.

Litigation

Abraham and Evelyn Kostick Trust v. Peter Crisp  et al.
In January 1996, a purported shareholder class action was filed in the 
California Superior Court for Santa Clara County naming the Company 
and its directors as defendants. The complaint sought injunctive relief and 
damages and alleged that acts of mismanagement resulted in a depressed 
price for the Company. In February 1996, the complaint was amended to 
add a former  director as a defendant and to add purported class and 
derivative claims based on theories such as breach of fiduciary duty, 
misrepresentation, and insider trading. In July 1996, the Court sustained 
defendants' demurrer and dismissed the amended complaint on a variety of 
grounds and granted plaintiffs leave to amend the complaint. In October 
1996, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint naming the 
Company's directors and certain former directors as defendants and again 
alleging purported class and derivative claims, seeking injunctive relief 
and damages (compensatory and punitive) based on theories such as 
breach of fiduciary duty, misrepresentation, and insider trading. In 
November 1996, the Company filed a demurrer seeking dismissal of the 
second amended complaint.

Derek Pritchard v. Michael Spindler et al.
In March 1996, a purported shareholder class action was filed in the 
California Superior Court for Santa Clara County naming certain current 
and former directors of the Company as defendants. The complaint sought 
damages and alleged that the defendants breached their fiduciary duty by 
allegedly rejecting an offer from a computer company (not named in the 
complaint) to acquire the Company at a price in excess of $50 per share. In
August 1996, the Court sustained defendants' demurrer and dismissed the 
complaint on a variety of grounds, and granted plaintiff leave to amend the 
complaint. In October 1996, the plaintiff filed his first amended complaint 
in which he asserted the same purported cause of action as the original 
complaint, alleged additional facts purportedly in support thereof, and 
added the Company as a defendant. The Company intends to file a 
demurrer seeking dismissal of the first amended complaint. 

LS Men's Clothing Defined Benefit Pension Fund v. Michael Spindler et al.
In May 1996, an action was filed in the California Superior Court for 
Alameda County naming as defendants the Company and certain of its 
current and former officers and directors. The complaint seeks 
compensatory and punitive damages and generally alleges that the 
defendants misrepresented or omitted material facts about the Company's 
operations and financial results, which plaintiff contends artificially 
inflated the price of the Company's stock. The case has been transferred to 
the California Superior Court for Santa Clara County. None of the 
defendants has yet responded to the complaint.  

"Repetitive Stress Injury" Litigation
The Company is named in numerous lawsuits (fewer than 100) alleging 
that the plaintiff incurred so-called "repetitive stress injury" to the upper
extremities as a result of using keyboards and/or mouse input devices sold 
by the Company. On October 4, 1996, in a trial of one of these cases 
(Dorsey v. Apple) in the United States District Court for the Eastern 
District of New York, the jury rendered a verdict in favor of the Company, 
and final judgement in favor of the Company has been entered. The other 
cases are in various stages of pretrial activity. These suits are similar to 
those filed against other major suppliers of personal computers. Ultimate 
resolution of the litigation against the Company may depend on progress in 
resolving this type of litigation in the industry overall. 
				45



Monitor-Size Litigation
In August 1995, the Company was named, along with 41 other entities, 
including computer manufacturers and computer monitor vendors, in a 
putative nationwide class action filed in the California Superior Court for 
Orange County, styled Keith Long et al. v. AAmazing Technologies Corp. 
et al.  The complaint alleges that each of the defendants engaged in false or 
misleading advertising with respect to the size of computer monitor 
screens. Also in August 1995, the Company was named as the sole 
defendant in a purported class action alleging similar claims filed in the 
New Jersey Superior Court for Camden County, entitled Mahendri Shah v. 
Apple Computer, Inc. Subsequently, in November 1995, the Company, 
along with 26 other entities, was named in a purported class action alleging 
similar claims filed in the New Jersey Superior Court for Essex County, 
entitled Maizes & Maizes v. Apple Computer, Inc. et al. Similar putative 
class actions have been filed in other California counties in which the 
Company was not named as a defendant. The complaints in all of these 
cases seek restitution in the form of refunds or product exchange, damages, 
punitive damages, and attorneys fees. In December 1995, the California 
Judicial Council ordered all of the California actions, including Long, 
coordinated for purposes of pretrial proceedings and trial before a single
judge, the Honorable William Cahill, sitting in the County of San 
Francisco. All of the California actions were subsequently coordinated 
under the name In re Computer Monitor Litigation and a master 
consolidated complaint filed superseding all of the individual complaints 
in those actions. On July 3, 1996, Judge Cahill ordered all of the California
cases dismissed without leave to amend as to plaintiffs residing in 
California on the ground that a stipulated judgment entered in September 
1995 in a prior action brought by the California Attorney General alleging
the same cause of action was res judicata as to the plaintiffs in the 
consolidated California class action suits. This order may be subject to 
appellate review at a later stage of the proceedings. Both the New Jersey
cases and the consolidated California cases are at a preliminary stage, with
no discovery having taken place.  

The Company has various claims, lawsuits, disputes with third parties, 
investigations, and pending actions involving allegations of false or 
misleading advertising, product defects, discrimination, infringement of 
intellectual property rights, and breach of contract and other matters 
against the Company and its subsidiaries incident to the operation of its
business. The liability, if any, associated with these matters is not 
determinable.

The Company believes the resolution of the foregoing actions will not 
have a material adverse effect on its financial condition. However, 
depending on the amount and timing of any unfavorable resolution of these
lawsuits, it is possible that the Company's results of operations could be 
materially affected in a particular period.
