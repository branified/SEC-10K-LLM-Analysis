GENERAL

Paragraph:
Our vision

Paragraph:
Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. Our strategy is to build best-in-class platforms and productivity services for a
mobile-first, cloud-first world.

Paragraph:
The mobile-first, cloud-first world is transforming the way individuals and organizations use and
interact with technology. Mobility is not focused on any one device; it is centered on the mobility of experiences that, in turn, are orchestrated by the cloud. Cloud computing and storage solutions provide people and enterprises with various
capabilities to store and process their data in third-party datacenters. Mobility encompasses the rich collection of data, applications, and services that accompany our customers as they move from setting to setting in their lives. We are
transforming our businesses to enable Microsoft to lead the direction of this digital transformation, and enable our customers and partners to thrive in this evolving world.

Paragraph:
What we offer

Paragraph:
Founded in 1975, we operate worldwide in over 190 countries. We develop,
license, and support a wide range of software products, services, and devices that deliver new opportunities, greater convenience, and enhanced value to peoples lives.

Paragraph:
Our products include operating systems; cross-device productivity applications; server applications; business solution applications; desktop and server management tools; software development tools; video games; and
training and certification of computer system integrators and developers. We also design, manufacture, and sell devices, including PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, phones, other intelligent devices, and related accessories, that
integrate with our cloud-based offerings. We offer an array of services, including cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content, and we provide solution support and consulting services. We also deliver
relevant online advertising to a global audience.

Paragraph:
The ambitions that drive us

Paragraph:
To carry out our strategy, our research and development efforts focus on three interconnected ambitions:

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Reinvent productivity and business processes.

Paragraph:
Item 1

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Build the intelligent cloud platform.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Create more personal computing.

Paragraph:
Reinvent productivity and business processes

Paragraph:
We believe we can significantly enhance the lives of our customers using our broad portfolio of productivity, communication, and information
services that span devices and platforms. Productivity will be the first and foremost objective, to enable people to meet and collaborate more easily, and to effectively express ideas in new ways. We invent new scenarios that in turn create
opportunity for our partners and help businesses accelerate their transformation while respecting each persons privacy choices. The foundation for these efforts will rest on advancing our leading productivity, collaboration, communication, and
business process tools including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, OneDrive, Skype, and Microsoft Dynamics (Dynamics). With Office 365, we provide these familiar industry-leading productivity and business process tools as cloud
services, enabling access from anywhere and any device. This creates an opportunity to reach new customers and expand the usage of our services by our existing customers. We see opportunity in combining our offerings in new ways that are
mobile, collaborative, intelligent and trustworthy. We offer our services across platforms and devices outside our own. As people move from device to device, so will their content and the richness of their services. We engineer our applications so
users can find, try, and buy them in friction-free ways.

Paragraph:
Build the intelligent cloud platform

Paragraph:
In deploying technology that advances business strategy, enterprises decide what solutions will make employees more productive, collaborative, and
satisfied, and connect with customers in new and compelling ways. They work to unlock business insights from a world of data. To achieve these objectives, increasingly businesses look to leverage the benefits of the cloud. Helping businesses move to
the cloud is one of our largest opportunities, and we believe we work from a position of strength. Microsoft is one of two leaders in the market.

Paragraph:
The shift to the cloud is driven by three important economies of scale: larger datacenters can deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; larger datacenters can
coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns, improving the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy lowers application maintenance labor costs for large public clouds. As
one of the largest providers of cloud computing at scale, we are well-positioned to help businesses move to the cloud and focus on innovation while leaving non-differentiating activities to reliable and cost-effective providers like Microsoft.

Paragraph:
We believe our server products and cloud services, which include Microsoft SQL Server (SQL Server), Windows Server, Visual
Studio, System Center, and Microsoft Azure (Azure), make us the only company with a public, private, and hybrid cloud platform that can power modern business. With Azure, we are one of very few cloud vendors that run at a scale that
meets the needs of businesses of all sizes and complexities. We are working to enhance the return on IT investment by enabling enterprises to combine their existing datacenters and our public cloud into a single cohesive infrastructure. Businesses
can deploy applications in their own datacenter, a partners datacenter, or in our datacenters with common security, management, and administration across all environments, with the flexibility and scale they want.

Paragraph:
We enable organizations to securely adopt software-as-a-service applications, both our own and third-party, and integrate them with their existing
security and management infrastructure. We continue to innovate with higher-level services including identity and directory services that manage employee corporate identity and manage and secure corporate information accessed and stored across a
growing number of devices, rich data storage and analytics services, machine learning services, media services, web and mobile backend services, and developer productivity services. To foster a rich developer ecosystem, our platform is extensible,
enabling customers and partners to further customize and enhance our solutions, achieving even more value. This strategy requires continuing investment in datacenters and other infrastructure to support our services.

Paragraph:
Item 1

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Create more personal computing

Paragraph:
We strive to make computing more personal by putting users at the core of the experience, enabling them to interact with technology in more intuitive, engaging, and dynamic ways. A computing device should be not
just a tool, but a partner. Windows 10 is the cornerstone of our ambition to usher in this era of more personal computing. We consider the launch of Windows 10 in July 2015 to be a transformative moment as we moved from an operating system that
runs on a PC to a service that can power the full spectrum of devices. We developed Windows 10 not only to be familiar to our users, but more safe, secure, and always up-to-date. Windows 10 is more personal and productive with functionality such as
Cortana, Windows Hello, Windows Ink, Microsoft Edge, and universal applications. Windows 10 is designed to foster innovation  from us, our partners, and developers  through rich and consistent experiences across the range of existing
devices and entirely new device categories.

Paragraph:
Our ambition for Windows 10 is to broaden our economic opportunity through three key
levers: an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) ecosystem that creates exciting new hardware designs for Windows 10; our own commitment to the health and profitability of our first-party premium device portfolio; and monetization
opportunities such as services, subscriptions, gaming, and search advertising. Our OEM partners are investing in an extensive portfolio of hardware designs and configurations for Windows 10. We now have the widest range of Windows hardware ever
available.

Paragraph:
With the unified Windows operating system, developers and OEMs can contribute to a thriving Windows ecosystem. We invest
heavily to make Windows the most secure, manageable, and capable operating system for the needs of a modern workforce. We are working to create a broad developer opportunity by unifying the installed base to Windows 10 through upgrades and ongoing
updates, and by enabling universal Windows applications to run across all device targets. As part of our strategic objectives, we are committed to designing and marketing first-party devices to help drive innovation, create new categories, and
stimulate demand in the Windows ecosystem. We are developing new input/output methods within Windows 10, including speech, pen, gesture, and augmented reality holograms to power more personal computing experiences.

Paragraph:
Our future opportunity

Paragraph:
There are several
distinct areas of technology that we aim to drive forward. Our goal is to lead the industry in these areas over the long-term, which we expect will translate to sustained growth. We are investing significant resources in:

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Delivering new productivity and business processes to improve how people communicate, collaborate, learn, work, play, and interact with one another.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Building and running cloud-based services in ways that unleash new experiences and opportunities for businesses and individuals.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Establishing the Windows platform across servers and devices, both our own and third-party, and the cloud to drive a thriving ecosystem of developers, unify
the cross-device user experience, and increase agility when bringing new advances to market.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Developing new devices that have increasingly natural ways to interact with them, including speech, pen, gesture, and augmented reality holograms.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Applying machine learning to make technology more intuitive and able to act on our behalf to understand and interpret our needs using natural methods of
communication.

Paragraph:
We believe the breadth of our products and services portfolio, our large global partner and customer
base, our growing ecosystem, and our ongoing investment in innovation position us to be a leader in these areas and differentiate ourselves from competitors.

OPERATING SEGMENTS

Paragraph:
Our segments provide management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. The segments enable the alignment of strategies and objectives across the development, sales, marketing, and services
organizations, and they provide a framework for timely and rational allocation of resources within businesses.

Paragraph:
In June 2015, we
announced a change in organizational structure to align to our strategic direction as a productivity and platform company. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, our chief operating decision maker, who is also our Chief Executive Officer,
requested changes in the information that he regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. As a result, beginning in fiscal year 2016, we report our financial performance based on our new segments, Productivity
and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing.

Paragraph:
Additional information on our operating segments and geographic
and product information is contained in Note 21  Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).

Paragraph:
Our reportable segments are described below.

Paragraph:

offerings into new markets such as security, analytics, collaboration, unified communications, and business intelligence. Office Commercial revenue is mainly affected by a combination of the demand from commercial customers for volume licensing and
Software Assurance and the number of information workers in an enterprise, as well as the continued shift to Office 365. Office 365 is our cloud-based service that provides access to Office plus other productivity services. CALs provide access
rights to certain Office Commercial products and services, including Exchange, SharePoint, and Skype for Business, and revenue is reported along with the associated Office products and services.

Paragraph:
Office Consumer

Paragraph:
Office Consumer is
designed to increase personal productivity through a range of products and services. Growth depends on our ability to reach new users, add value to our core product set, and continue to expand our product and service offerings into new markets.
Office Consumer revenue is mainly affected by the combination of customers that buy Office with their new devices and the continued shift to Office 365. Office Consumer Services revenue is mainly affected by the demand for communication and storage
through Skype, Outlook.com, and OneDrive, which is largely driven by subscriptions, advertising, and the sale of minutes. Skype is designed to connect friends, family, clients, and colleagues through a variety of devices.

Paragraph:
Dynamics provides business solutions for financial management, customer relationship management (CRM), supply chain management, and analytics applications for small and mid-size businesses, large
organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. Dynamics revenue is largely driven by the number of information workers licensed.

Paragraph:
Competition

Paragraph:
Competitors to Office include software and global application vendors such as Adobe Systems, Apple, Cisco Systems, Facebook,
Google, IBM, Oracle, SAP, and numerous web-based and mobile application competitors as well as local application developers in Asia and Europe. Cisco Systems is using its position in enterprise communications equipment to grow its unified
communications business. Google provides a hosted messaging and productivity suite. Apple distributes versions of its pre-installed application software, such as email, note-taking, and calendar products, through its PCs, tablets, and phones. Skype
for Business and Skype also compete with a variety of instant messaging, voice, and video communication providers, ranging from start-ups to established enterprises. Web-based offerings competing with individual applications have also positioned
themselves as alternatives to our products. We believe our products compete effectively based on our strategy of providing powerful, flexible, secure, and easy-to-use solutions that work well with technologies our customers already have and are
available on a device or via the cloud.

Paragraph:
Our Dynamics products compete with vendors such as Oracle and SAP in the market for large
organizations and divisions of global enterprises. In the market focused on providing solutions for small and mid-sized businesses, our Dynamics products compete with vendors such as Infor, The Sage Group, and NetSuite. Salesforce.coms
cloud CRM offerings compete directly with our Dynamics CRM on-premises and CRM Online offerings.

Paragraph:
Intelligent Cloud

Paragraph:
Our Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server products and cloud services that can power modern business. This
segment primarily comprises:

Enterprise Services

Paragraph:
Enterprise Services, including Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services, assist customers in developing, deploying, and managing Microsoft server and desktop solutions and provide training and
certification to developers and IT professionals on various Microsoft products.

Paragraph:
Competition

Paragraph:
Our server products face competition from a wide variety of server operating systems and applications offered by companies with a range of market
approaches. Vertically integrated computer manufacturers such as Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and Oracle offer their own versions of the Unix operating system preinstalled on server hardware. Nearly all computer manufacturers offer server hardware for the
Linux operating system and many contribute to Linux operating system development. The competitive position of Linux has also benefited from the large number of compatible applications now produced by many commercial and non-commercial software
developers. A number of companies, such as Red Hat, supply versions of Linux.

Paragraph:
We compete to provide enterprise-wide computing solutions
and point solutions with numerous commercial software vendors that offer solutions and middleware technology platforms, software applications for connectivity (both Internet and intranet), security, hosting, database, and e-business servers. IBM and
Oracle lead a group of companies focused on the Java Platform Enterprise Edition that competes with our enterprise-wide computing solutions. Commercial competitors for our server applications for PC-based distributed client/server environments
include CA Technologies, IBM, and Oracle. Our web application platform software competes with open source software such as Apache, Linux, MySQL, and PHP. In middleware, we compete against Java vendors.

Paragraph:
Our database, business intelligence, and data warehousing solutions offerings compete with products from IBM, Oracle, SAP, and other companies. Our
system management solutions compete with server management and server virtualization platform providers, such as BMC, CA Technologies, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and VMware. Our products for software developers compete against offerings from Adobe, IBM,
Oracle, other companies, and open-source projects, including Eclipse (sponsored by CA Technologies, IBM, Oracle, and SAP), PHP, and Ruby on Rails, among others.

Paragraph:
We believe our server products provide customers with advantages in performance, total costs of ownership, and productivity by delivering superior applications, development tools, compatibility with a broad base of
hardware and software applications, security, and manageability.

Paragraph:
Azure faces diverse competition from companies such as Amazon, Google,
IBM, Oracle, Salesforce.com, VMware, and open source offerings. Azures competitive advantage includes enabling a hybrid cloud, allowing deployment of existing datacenters with our public cloud into a single, cohesive infrastructure, and the
ability to run at a scale that meets the needs of businesses of all sizes and complexities.

Paragraph:
Our Enterprise Services business competes
with a wide range of companies that provide strategy and business planning, application development, and infrastructure services, including multinational consulting firms and small niche businesses focused on specific technologies.

Paragraph:
Windows

Paragraph:
The Windows operating system is designed to deliver a more personal computing experience for users by enabling consistency of
experience, applications, and information across their devices. We consider the launch of Windows 10 in July 2015 to be a transformative moment as we moved from an operating system that runs on a PC to a service that can power the full spectrum of

multinational OEMs, and different pricing of Windows versions licensed.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Piracy.

Paragraph:
Volume licensing
of the Windows operating system is affected mainly by the demand from commercial customers for volume licensing and Software Assurance, often reflecting the number of information workers in a licensed enterprise, and is therefore relatively
independent of the number of PCs sold in a given year.

of technology areas, including mobile devices and cloud offerings.

Paragraph:
Windows Embedded extends the power of Windows and the cloud to
intelligent systems by delivering specialized operating systems, tools, and services.

Paragraph:
Display advertising primarily includes MSN ads.
In June 2015, we entered into agreements with AOL and AppNexus to outsource our display sales responsibility.

Paragraph:
The Windows Phone
operating system is designed to bring users closer to the people, applications, and content they need. Prior to our acquisition of Nokia Corporations (Nokia) Devices and Services business (NDS) in April 2014, Microsoft
and Nokia jointly created new mobile products and services and extended established products and services to new markets through a strategic alliance.

Paragraph:
Devices

Paragraph:
We design, manufacture, and sell
devices such as Surface, phones, and other intelligent devices, as well as PC accessories. Our devices are designed to enable people and organizations to connect to the people and content that matter most using integrated Microsoft services and
Windows. Surface is designed to help organizations, students, and consumers to be more productive. Our latest Surface devices, the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book, were released in October 2015. We began manufacturing and selling Microsoft Lumia
(Lumia) phones and other phones with the acquisition of NDS in April 2014. In July 2015, we announced a plan to restructure our phone business to better focus and align resources. In May 2016, we announced plans to further streamline our
smartphone hardware business. We also recently announced the sale of our entry-level feature phone business in May 2016. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2016, subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.

Gaming

Paragraph:
Our gaming platform is designed to provide a unique variety of entertainment through the use of our devices, peripherals, applications, online services, and content. We released Xbox 360 and Xbox One in November
2005 and November 2013, respectively, and recently announced Xbox One S will be released in August 2016. We also launched our Windows 10 Xbox app in July 2015. Xbox Live enables people to connect and share online gaming experiences and is
accessible on Xbox consoles, Windows-enabled devices, and other devices. Xbox Live services consist of subscriptions and sales of Xbox Live enabled content, as well as advertising, and are designed to benefit users by providing access to a
network of certified applications and services and to benefit our developer and partner ecosystems by providing access to a large customer base. We also design and sell gaming content to showcase our unique platform capabilities for Xbox consoles,
Windows-enabled devices, and other devices. We acquired Mojang Synergies AB, the Swedish video game developer of the Minecraft gaming franchise, in November 2014. The addition of Minecraft and its community enhances our gaming portfolio across
Windows, Xbox, and other ecosystems besides our own. We believe the success of our gaming business is determined by the overall active user base through Xbox Live enabled content, availability of games, providing exclusive game content that gamers
seek, the computational power and reliability of the devices used to access our content and services, and the ability to create new experiences via online services, downloadable content, and peripherals.

Paragraph:
Search Advertising

Paragraph:
Search advertising,
including Bing and Bing Ads, is designed to deliver relevant online advertising to a global audience. We have several partnerships with other companies, including Yahoo!, in which we provide and monetize search results. Growth depends on our ability
to attract new users, understand intent, and match intent with relevant content and advertiser offerings.

Paragraph:
Competition

Paragraph:
The Windows operating system faces competition from various software products and from alternative platforms and devices, mainly from Apple and
Google. We believe Windows competes effectively by giving customers choice, value, flexibility, security, an easy-to-use interface, and compatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications, including those that enable productivity.

Paragraph:
Our devices face competition from various computer, tablet, hardware, and phone manufacturers, and offer a unique combination of
high-quality industrial design and innovative technologies across various price points, many of which are also current or potential partners and customers. These manufacturers include Apple, as well as our Windows OEM partners.

Paragraph:
Our gaming platform competes with console platforms from Sony and Nintendo, both of which have a large, established base of customers. The
lifecycle for gaming and entertainment consoles averages five to ten years. Nintendo released their latest generation console in November 2012. Sony released their latest generation console in November 2013.

Paragraph:
In addition to Sony and Nintendo, we compete with other providers of entertainment services through online marketplaces. We believe our gaming
platform is effectively positioned against competitive products and services based on significant innovation in hardware architecture, user interface, developer tools, online gaming and entertainment services, and continued strong exclusive content
from our own game franchises as well as other digital content offerings. Our video games competitors include Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard. Xbox Live faces competition from various online marketplaces, including those operated by Amazon,
Apple, and Google.

Paragraph:
Our search advertising business competes with Google and a wide array of websites, social platforms like Facebook,
and portals that provide content and online offerings to end users.

OPERATIONS

Paragraph:
We have operations centers that support all operations in their regions, including customer contract and order processing, credit and collections, information processing, and vendor management and logistics. The
regional center in Ireland supports the European, Middle Eastern, and African region; the center in Singapore supports the Japan, India, Greater China, and Asia-Pacific region; and the centers in Fargo, North Dakota, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Puerto
Rico, Redmond, Washington, and Reno, Nevada support Latin America and North America. In addition to the operations centers, we also operate datacenters throughout the Americas, Australia, Europe, and Asia.

Paragraph:
To serve the needs of customers around the world and to improve the quality and usability of products in international markets, we localize many of
our products to reflect local languages and conventions. Localizing a product may require modifying the user interface, altering dialog boxes, and translating text.

Paragraph:
We operate manufacturing facilities for the production and customization of phones, predominantly in Vietnam. We announced the sale of our entry-level feature phone business in May 2016, which includes the sale of
our phone manufacturing facility in Vietnam.

Paragraph:
Our devices, other than phones, are primarily manufactured by third-party contract
manufacturers. We generally have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements.

Paragraph:
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Paragraph:
During fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, research and development
expense was $12.0 billion, $12.0 billion, and $11.4 billion, respectively. These amounts represented 14%, 13%, and 13% of revenue in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. We plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad
range of research and development efforts.

Paragraph:
Product and Service Development, and Intellectual Property

Paragraph:
We develop most of our products and services internally through three engineering groups.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Applications and Services Engineering Group
, focuses on broad applications and services core technologies in productivity, communication, education,
search, and other information categories.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Cloud and Enterprise Engineering Group
, focuses on our cloud infrastructure, server, database, CRM, enterprise resource planning, management,
development tools, and other business process applications and services for enterprises.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Windows and Devices Engineering Group
, focuses on our Windows platform across devices of all types, hardware development of our devices, and associated
online marketplaces.

Paragraph:
Internal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product
differentiation and closer technical control over our products and services. It also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. We strive to obtain information as early
as possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software design. Before releasing new software platforms, we provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development, training, and testing.
Generally, we also create product documentation internally.

Paragraph:
We protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. We
work actively in the U.S. and internationally to ensure the enforcement of copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other protections that apply to our software and hardware products, services, business plans, and branding. We are a leader among
technology companies in pursuing patents and currently have a portfolio of over 61,000 U.S. and international patents issued and over 35,000

pending. While we employ much of our internally developed intellectual property exclusively in Microsoft products and services, we also engage in outbound and inbound licensing of specific
patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees or Microsofts products. From time to time, we enter into broader cross-license agreements with other technology companies covering entire groups of patents. We also purchase or
license technology that we incorporate into our products or services. At times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as promoting industry standards, advancing
interoperability, or attracting and enabling our external development community.

Paragraph:
While it may be necessary in the future to seek or
renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and business methods, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our continuing
research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products.

Paragraph:
Investing in the Future

Paragraph:
Microsofts success is based on our ability to create new and
compelling products, services, and experiences for our users, to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new geographic and product markets, and to drive broad adoption of our products and services. We invest in a range of
emerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we believe offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the company. Based on our assessment of key technology trends, we maintain our long-term commitment to
research and development across a wide spectrum of technologies, tools, and platforms spanning digital work and life experiences, cloud computing, and devices operating systems and hardware.

Paragraph:
While our main research and development facilities are located in Redmond, Washington, we also operate research and development facilities in other
parts of the U.S. and around the world, including Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, India, Ireland, Israel, Japan, and the United Kingdom. This global approach helps us remain competitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract
top talent from across the world. We generally fund research at the corporate level to ensure that we are looking beyond immediate product considerations to opportunities further in the future. We also fund research and development activities at the
business segment level. Much of our business segment level research and development is coordinated with other segments and leveraged across the company.

Paragraph:
In addition to our main research and development operations, we also operate Microsoft Research. Microsoft Research is one of the worlds largest computer science research organizations, and works in close
collaboration with top universities around the world to advance the state-of-the-art in computer science, providing us a unique perspective on future technology trends and contributing to our innovation.

Paragraph:
DISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING

Paragraph:
We market and distribute our products and services through the following channels: OEMs, distributors and resellers, online, and Microsoft retail stores. Our sales force performs a variety of functions, including
working directly with enterprises and public sector organizations worldwide to identify and meet their software requirements; managing OEM relationships; and supporting solution integrators, independent software vendors, and other partners who
engage directly with our customers to perform sales, consulting, and fulfillment functions for our products.

Paragraph:
OEMs

Paragraph:
We distribute software through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they sell. The largest component of the OEM business
is the Windows operating system pre-installed on computing devices. OEMs also sell hardware pre-installed with other Microsoft products, including server and embedded operating systems and applications such as our Microsoft Office suite. In addition
to these products, we also market our services through OEMs and service bundles such as Windows with Bing or Windows with Office 365 subscription.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
There are two broad categories of OEMs. The largest OEMs, many of which operate globally, are
referred to as Direct OEMs, as our relationship with them is managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all of the multinational
OEMs, including Acer, ASUST, Dell, Fujitsu, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, Samsung, Toshiba, and with many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs consists of lower-volume PC manufacturers (also called system builders),
which source their Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft.

Paragraph:
Distributors and Resellers

Paragraph:
Many
organizations that license our products and services through Enterprise Agreements transact directly with us, with sales support from solution integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and developers that advise organizations on
licensing our products and services (Enterprise Agreement Software Advisors, or ESAs). Organizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners (LSPs),
distributors, value-added resellers (VARs), OEMs, system builder channels, and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner reaches organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily engaged with large organizations, distributors
resell primarily to VARs, and VARs typically reach small- and medium-sized organizations. ESAs typically are also authorized as LSPs and operate as resellers for our other licensing programs, such as the Select Plus and Open licensing programs
discussed under Licensing Options below. Some of our distributors include Ingram Micro and Tech Data, and some of our largest resellers include CDW, Dell, Insight Enterprises, and Software House International.

Paragraph:
Our Dynamics software offerings are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and
specialized services. We distribute our retail packaged products primarily through independent non-exclusive distributors, authorized replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail
outlets, including Microsoft retail stores. We distribute our devices through third-party retailers and Microsoft retail stores. Our phones are also distributed through global wireless communications carriers. We have a network of field sales
representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers, and provide product training and sales support.

Paragraph:
Online

Paragraph:
Although on-premises software
continues to be an important part of our business, increasingly we are delivering additional value to customers through cloud-based services. We provide commercial cloud-based solutions such as Office 365, Azure, and Dynamics CRM Online. We also
provide online content services to consumers through Bing, MSN portals and channels, Office 365, Xbox Live, Outlook.com, OneDrive, Skype, and Windows Store. Other services delivered online include our online advertising platform with offerings for
advertisers and publishers, as well as Microsoft Developer Network subscription content and updates, periodic product updates, and online technical and practice readiness resources to support our partners in developing and selling our products and
solutions. As we increasingly deliver online services, we sell many of these cloud-based services through our enterprise agreements and have also enabled new sales programs to reach small and medium-sized businesses. These programs include
direct sales, direct sales supported by a large network of partner advisors, and resale of services through operator channels, such as telephone, cell, and cable providers.

Paragraph:
We also sell our products through our Microsoft retail stores and online marketplaces.

Paragraph:
LICENSING
OPTIONS

Paragraph:
We license software to organizations under agreements that allow the customer to acquire multiple licenses of products and
services. Our agreements for organizations to acquire multiple licenses of products and services are designed to provide them with a means of doing so without having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. In delivering organizational
licensing agreements to the market, we use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations of various sizes. While these programs may differ in various parts of the world, generally they include those discussed below.

Enterprise Agreement Licensing

Paragraph:
Designed primarily for medium- and large-sized organizations
that want to obtain the best value by standardizing on a common IT platform across their organization. Under the Enterprise Agreement, customers can acquire licenses for online services and/or software products with Software Assurance, which convey
rights to future versions of certain software products over the contract period. Software Assurance also provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use software efficiently. Enterprises can elect to acquire perpetual licenses
or, under the Enterprise Subscription option, can acquire non-perpetual, subscription licenses for a specified period (generally three years). Online services are also available, and subscriptions are generally structured with three-year terms.

Paragraph:
Microsoft Product and Services Agreement Licensing

Paragraph:
Suited for medium- and large-sized organizations, the Microsoft Products and Services Agreement (MPSA) provides customers the ability to purchase online services subscriptions, software licenses,
software licenses with Software Assurance, and renewals of Software Assurance through a single agreement. Software Assurance and online services subscriptions are generally available for a term of up to three years. We plan on expanding the
offers under the MPSA in fiscal year 2017 to better enable organizations to obtain the best value by standardizing on a common IT platform across their organization.

Paragraph:
Select Plus Licensing

Paragraph:
Designed primarily for medium- and large-sized organizations, the
Select Plus program allows customers to acquire perpetual licenses and, at the customers election, Software Assurance over a specified time period (generally three years or less). Similar to Open programs, the Select Plus program allows
customers to acquire licenses only, acquire licenses with Software Assurance, or renew Software Assurance upon the expiration of existing volume licensing agreements. A subset of online services is also available for purchase through the Select Plus
program, and subscriptions are generally structured with terms between one and three years.

Paragraph:
In July 2014, we announced the retirement
over a two-year period of Select Plus agreements for commercial customers, in favor of modern licensing options. Beginning July 2015, no new Select Plus agreements were signed with commercial organizations, and customers who want to purchase
licenses were encouraged to transition to the MPSA. Starting in July 2016, we will no longer be accepting orders from commercial organizations for Select Plus after their next agreement anniversary. We expect the entire Select Plus business to
transition to the MPSA within a few years.

Paragraph:
Open Licensing

Paragraph:
Designed primarily for small- and medium-sized organizations, the Open programs allow customers to acquire perpetual or subscription licenses and, at the customers election, rights to future versions of
software products over a specified time period (generally two or three years depending on the specific programs used). The Open programs have several variations to fit customers diverse ways of purchasing. Under the Open License program,
customers can acquire licenses only or licenses with Software Assurance, and/or renew Software Assurance upon the expiration of other existing volume licensing agreements. Under the Open Value and Open Value Subscription programs, customers can
acquire perpetual or subscription licenses, respectively, over a three-year period. Online services are available in each of the Open programs.

Paragraph:
Customer Licensing Programs  Online Services Only

support their customer subscriptions. Partners can easily package their own tools, products, and services, and combine them into one monthly or annual customer bill.

Paragraph:
The Microsoft Services Provider License Agreement is a program targeted at service providers and independent software vendors allowing these partners to provide software services and hosted applications to their
end customers. Agreements are generally structured with a three-year term, and partners are billed monthly based upon consumption.

Paragraph:
The
Microsoft Online Services Reseller Agreement is a program that enables partners to package Microsoft online services with the partners services.

Paragraph:
The Independent Software Vendor Royalty program enables partners to use Microsoft software in their own software programs.

Paragraph:
CUSTOMERS

Paragraph:
Our customers include individual consumers, small- and medium-sized organizations,
large global enterprises, public sector institutions, Internet service providers, application developers, and OEMs. No sales to an individual customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue in fiscal years 2016, 2015, or 2014. Our practice is to
ship our products promptly upon receipt of purchase orders from customers; consequently, backlog is not significant.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Paragraph:
Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash
flows, and the trading price of our common stock.

Paragraph:
We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to
lower revenue or operating margins.

Paragraph:
Competition in the technology sector

Paragraph:
Our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized firms
whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and
disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and
consumers.

Paragraph:
Competition among platforms, ecosystems, and devices

Paragraph:
An important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among
users, application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. We face significant competition from firms that provide
competing platforms, applications, and services.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related services, has succeeded
with some consumer products such as personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles, and wearables. Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform. We also offer some
vertically-integrated hardware and software products and services. To the extent we shift a portion of our business to a vertically integrated model we increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on personal computers. We face significant competition from competing platforms
developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablet computers. These devices compete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the device and its platform. Users are increasingly turning to these devices to
perform functions that in the past were performed by personal computers. Even if many users view these devices as complementary to a personal computer, the prevalence of these devices may make it more difficult to

attract application developers to our PC operating system platforms. Competing with operating systems licensed at low or no cost may decrease our PC operating system margins. In addition, some of
our devices compete with products made by our OEM partners, which may affect their commitment to our platform.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Competing platforms have application marketplaces (sometimes referred to as stores) with scale and significant installed bases. The variety and
utility of applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing decisions. Users incur costs to move data and buy new applications when switching platforms. To compete, we must successfully enlist developers to write
applications for our marketplace and ensure that these applications have high quality, customer appeal, and value. Efforts to compete with competitors application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our operating margins.

Paragraph:
Business model competition

Paragraph:
Companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Even as we transition to a mobile-first and cloud-first strategy, the license-based proprietary software model generates most of our software revenue. We bear
the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products. Many of our competitors also develop and sell software to
businesses and consumers under this model.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Other competitors develop and offer free applications, online services and content, and make money by selling third-party advertising. Advertising revenue
funds development of products and services these competitors provide to users at no or little cost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Some companies compete with us using an open source business model by modifying and then distributing open source software at nominal cost to end-users, and
earning revenue on advertising or complementary services and products. These firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the software. Some open source software vendors develop software that mimics the features and functionality
of our products.

Paragraph:
The competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions,
and/or increased operating costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. This may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income.

Paragraph:
Our increasing focus on services presents execution and competitive risks.    
A growing part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing
devices. Our strategic vision is to compete and grow as a productivity and platform company for the mobile-first and cloud-first world. At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and
business customers. Pricing and delivery models are evolving. Devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the users choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We are devoting significant
resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. The Windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. We are undertaking cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to
innovation. The Companys increasing reliance on data-driven insights is becoming more important to the success of key opportunities in monetization, customer perceptions of quality, and operational efficiency. Besides software development
costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. These costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. Whether we succeed in cloud-based services depends on our execution in
several areas, including:

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based services on the growing array of computing devices, including PCs, smartphones,
tablets, gaming consoles, and other television-related devices.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Making our suite of cloud-based services platform-agnostic, available on a wide range of devices and ecosystems, including those of our competitors.

Paragraph:
It is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed. If we are
not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure
and development investments described above. This may negatively impact gross margins and operating income.

Paragraph:
We make significant
investments in new products and services that may not achieve expected returns.    
We will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies,
including the Windows operating system, the Microsoft Office system, Bing, Windows Phone, Windows Server, the Windows Store, the Microsoft Azure Services platform, Office 365, other cloud-based offerings, and the Xbox entertainment platform. We also
invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment including PCs, tablets, phones, and gaming devices. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on
many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new
software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be
profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically.

Paragraph:
The launch of Windows 10, with free upgrades available to existing users of Windows 7 and 8.1, constitutes the most ambitious update effort we have ever undertaken. We have done extensive preparation and
compatibility testing for applications and devices to help ensure a positive experience for our users installing Windows 10. However, if users have a negative upgrade experience, or the community reacts negatively to the process we are following to
promote and undertake the upgrades, the reception of Windows 10 in the marketplace may be harmed, and customers or government agencies may bring litigation or regulatory actions. In addition, we anticipate that Windows 10 will enable
new post-license monetization opportunities beyond initial license revenues. Our failure to realize these opportunities to the extent we expect could have an adverse impact on our revenues. Finally, our practices around data collection, use,
and management in Windows 10 could result in regulatory review and decisions directing us to change these practices and imposing fines. If so, we could face negative public reaction, degraded user experiences, and reduced flexibility in product
design.

Paragraph:
Developing new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases
or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue.

Paragraph:
Acquisitions, joint ventures, and
strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business.    
We expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. In June 2016,
we announced our acquisition of LinkedIn for approximately $26.2 billion. The LinkedIn acquisition and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we
get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that we have difficulty integrating new employees, business systems, and technology, or that they distract management from our other businesses. If an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate
changing circumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. The success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing
products and services or develop compelling new ones. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements, such as increased revenue, enhanced efficiencies, or increased market share, or the
benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. These events could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition.

Paragraph:
If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record
a significant charge to earnings.    
We acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. We review
our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be a change in circumstances, indicating
that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in
which we participate. We may be required to record a significant charge on our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our
results of operations. For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we recorded a $5.1 billion charge for the impairment of goodwill and a $2.2 billion charge for the impairment of intangible assets, and in the fourth quarter of fiscal
year 2016 we recorded a $480 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets. The impairment charges for both periods related to our phone business. Our acquisition of LinkedIn will result in a significant increase in our goodwill and
intangible asset balances.

Paragraph:
We may not earn the revenues we expect from our intellectual property rights.

Paragraph:
We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights

Paragraph:
Protecting our global intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property is difficult. While piracy adversely affects U.S. revenue, the impact on
revenue from outside the U.S. is more significant, particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights. Our revenue in these markets may grow slower than the underlying device market. Similarly, the absence of
harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. Throughout the world, we educate consumers about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual
property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. Reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue.

Paragraph:
We may not receive expected royalties from our patent licenses

Paragraph:
We expend significant resources to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will generate revenues by incorporating that intellectual property in our products or services or, in some
instances, by licensing our patents to others in return for a royalty. Changes in the law may weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents. These include legislative changes and
regulatory actions that make it more difficult to obtain injunctions, and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patents. Similarly, licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties, or may contest
the scope and extent of their obligations. Finally, the royalties we can obtain to monetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology, selling price changes in products using licensed patents, or the difficulty of
discovering infringements.

Paragraph:
Third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights.
    From
time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. The number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, the
rapid rate of issuance of new patents, and our offering of first-party devices, such as Surface and Lumia phones. To resolve these claims, we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available,
stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. These outcomes may cause operating margins to decline. Besides money damages, in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek
injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. In some countries, such as Germany, an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the
validity of the underlying patents. We have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk, and may
continue to do so.

Paragraph:
We may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized
disclosure of source code.    
Source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. Although we license portions of our application and operating system
source code to several licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. If a significant portion of our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that source code. It may
become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the
next paragraph.

Paragraph:
Cyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our
competitive position.

Paragraph:
Security of Microsofts information technology

Paragraph:
Threats to IT security can take a variety of forms. Individual and groups of hackers, and sophisticated organizations including state-sponsored
organizations or nation-states themselves, may take steps that pose threats to our customers and our IT. These actors may use a wide variety of methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software to attack our products and
services and gain access to our networks and datacenters, using social engineering techniques, or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. Cyber threats are constantly evolving, thereby
increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Cyber threats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers. Breaches of
our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays,
compromise confidential or technical business information harming our competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies, or otherwise
adversely affect our business.

Paragraph:
In addition, our internal IT environment continues to evolve. Often we are early adopters of new devices
and technologies. We embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. Our business policies and internal security controls
may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge.

Paragraph:
Security of our products, services, devices, and customers data

Paragraph:
Security threats are a particular challenge to companies like us whose business is technology products and services. Threats to our own IT
infrastructure can also affect our customers. Customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data. Hackers tend to focus their efforts on the
most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we expect that to continue. The security of our products and services is important in our customers purchasing decisions.

Paragraph:
To defend against security threats, both to our internal IT systems and those of our customers, we must continuously engineer more secure products
and services, enhance security and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not
deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services, and provide customers security tools such as firewalls and anti-virus software.

Paragraph:
The cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins. If we fail to do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our
products and services could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. Customers may also spend more on protecting their existing
computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional

products or services. Customers may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install security patches. Any of these
actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no
assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. Legislative or regulatory action in these areas may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services.

Paragraph:
Disclosure of personal data could cause liability and harm our reputation.    
As we continue to grow the number and
scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment
increasingly hostile to information security. Despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and vendors on data
security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of customer data we or our vendors store and manage. Improper disclosure could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers, or subject us to liability under
laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our software products and services also enable our customers to store and process personal data on-premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host.
Government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer data in response to valid legal orders. In the U.S. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to
compel disclosure. Despite our efforts to protect customer data, perceptions that the collection, use and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could limit adoption of
our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. Additional security measures we may take to address customer concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to
customer expectations or governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses.

Paragraph:
We may have outages, data losses, and
disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure.    
Our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power.
We spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. These demands continue to increase as we
introduce new products and services and support the growth of existing services such as Bing, Exchange Online, Office 365, SharePoint Online, OneDrive, Skype, Xbox Live, Microsoft Azure, Outlook.com, Windows Stores, and Microsoft Account services.
We are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users. Maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex. It requires that we
maintain an Internet connectivity infrastructure that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve. Inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data or
insufficient Internet connectivity, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential
users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may harm our operating results and financial condition.

Paragraph:
Government litigation and
regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products.    
As a leading global software and device maker, we are closely scrutinized by government agencies under U.S. and foreign
competition laws. An increasing number of governments are regulating competition law activities and this includes increased scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the European Union (EU), the U.S., and China. Some jurisdictions
also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. U.S. federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business.

Paragraph:
The European Commission (the Commission) closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume Microsoft products and the terms on which we
make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. Flagship product releases such as Windows 10 can receive significant scrutiny under competition laws. For
example, in 2004, the Commission ordered us to create new versions of our Windows operating system that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our

competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary Windows communications protocols in their own products. In 2009, the Commission accepted a set of commitments offered by
Microsoft to address the Commissions concerns relating to competition in web browsing software, including an undertaking to address Commission concerns relating to interoperability. The web browsing commitments expired in 2014. The remaining
obligations may limit our ability to innovate in Windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the Windows platform, and increase our product development costs. The availability of licenses related to protocols and file
formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products, which could hamper sales of our products.

Paragraph:
Our portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time our OEM partners offer a large variety of devices on our platforms. As a result, increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our OEM
partners, creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules. Regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase. Certain foreign governments, particularly in China and other countries in Asia, have advanced arguments under their
competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property. Because these jurisdictions only recently implemented competition laws, their enforcement activities are unpredictable.

Paragraph:
Government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and
businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them. New competition law actions could be initiated. The outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways,
including:

Paragraph:
Our ability to realize anticipated Windows 10 post-sale monetization opportunities may be limited.

Paragraph:
Our global operations subject us to potential liability under anti-corruption, trade protection, and other laws and
regulations.    
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (Anti-Corruption Laws) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents. From time to time, we receive
inquiries from authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere and reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the U.S. and our compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws. Specifically, we have been cooperating with authorities in the US
in connection with reports concerning our compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in various countries. While we devote substantial resources to our global compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls
designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments, our employees, vendors, or agents may violate our policies. Our failure to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our
officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some geographies. Operations outside the U.S. may be
affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies, and measures, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. We may be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we sell goods or services in violation
of U.S. trade sanctions on countries such as Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Sudan, and Syria.

Paragraph:
Other regulatory areas that may apply to our
products and online services offerings include user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, and online content. For example, regulators may take the position that our offerings such as Skype are covered by laws regulating
telecommunications services. Applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may conflict from

jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Additionally, these laws and governments approach to their enforcement, and our products and services, are continuing to evolve. Compliance with these types of
regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity.

Paragraph:
Laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs, legal
claims, or fines against us.
    The growth of our internet- and cloud-based services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries. Legal requirements relating to the collection,
storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. For example, in October 2015 the European Court of Justice (ECJ) invalidated the EU/U.S. safe harbor framework, in place since 2000, that enabled companies to transfer
data from EU member states to the U.S. Although other legally-recognized methods to enable data transfers currently remain valid, the reasoning of the ECJ striking down the safe harbor framework could be used to challenge those methods in future
complaints. There is a recognized need for a new regulatory safe harbor framework that will also support other methods of data transfer between the EU and U.S. Outcomes may include a new trans-Atlantic data transfer agreement, a new EU data
protection directive, or a range of legal requirements adopted by individual EU member states, or no action at all. One or more of these outcomes may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements affecting the location and movement of our
customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data. Compliance may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty
in competing with foreign-based firms. Failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity.

Paragraph:
Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees.    
Our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees. The market for highly
skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. We are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain key
employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth
transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. How employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our
workforce needs.

Paragraph:
We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes.    
We are
subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. These claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases such as Windows 10, significant business transactions, and employment practices.
Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. The litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties
and managements view of these matters may change in the future. A material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably
estimable.

Paragraph:
We may have additional tax liabilities.    
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many
foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
We regularly are under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. Although we believe our
tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation in the jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of
an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made.

Paragraph:
We earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the U.S., and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the U.S. may result in higher effective tax rates for the
company. In addition, there have been proposals from Congress to change U.S. tax laws that would significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed
legislation may pass, if enacted, it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flows.

Our hardware and software products may experience quality or supply
problems.    
Our vertically-integrated hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, phones, and other devices we design, manufacture, and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or
associated software. We could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm if we fail to detect or address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs. We acquire some device components from sole suppliers. Our
competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. If a component from a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity
constraint or industry shortages, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales. Component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue.
Xbox consoles, Surface devices, phones, and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins. These same
risks would apply to any other vertically-integrated hardware and software products we may offer.

Paragraph:
Our software products also may
experience quality or reliability problems. The highly sophisticated software products we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could
cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our
exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge.

Paragraph:
We strive to empower all people and
organizations to achieve more and accessibility of our products is an important aspect of this goal. There is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, and customers to make technology more accessible. If our products do not
meet customer expectations or emerging global accessibility requirements, we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory actions.

Paragraph:
Our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks.    
Our customers are located in over 200 countries and
a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks. Emerging markets are a significant focus of our international growth strategy. The developing nature of these
markets presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. Although we hedge a portion of our international
currency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenue. Competitive or regulatory pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we
reduce the sales price of our software in the U.S. and other countries.

Paragraph:
Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt
our business.    
A disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing
services, or performing other critical functions. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other
business operations in the Silicon Valley area of California, both of which are seismically active regions. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems could harm our ability to
conduct normal business operations. Providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans, and magnifies the potential impact of
prolonged service outages on our operating results.

Paragraph:
Abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict pose a risk of
general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs. These conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers, and may cause supply chain
disruptions for hardware manufacturers, either of which may adversely affect our revenue. The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy or the IT industry in particular are unclear. Environmental regulations or changes in the supply,
demand or available sources of energy or other natural resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. Changes in weather where we operate may increase the costs of
powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services.

Adverse economic or market conditions may harm our
business.    
Worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower IT spending and adversely affect our revenue. If demand for PCs, servers, and other
computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected. Substantial revenue comes from our U.S. government contracts. An extended federal government shutdown resulting from
failing to pass budget appropriations, adopt continuing funding resolutions or raise the debt ceiling, and other budgetary decisions limiting or delaying federal government spending, could reduce government IT spending on our products and services
and adversely affect our revenue.

Paragraph:
Our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. OEMs building
devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution. The impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, OEM, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption.

Paragraph:
Challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. As a result,
allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase.

We maintain an investment portfolio of various
holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by unusual events that affect global financial markets. A significant part of our investment

portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results.

and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements.

Paragraph:
OVERVIEW

Paragraph:
Microsoft is a
technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. Our strategy is to build best-in-class platforms and productivity services for a mobile-first, cloud-first world. We develop, license,
and support a wide range of software products, services, and devices that deliver new opportunities, greater convenience, and enhanced value to peoples lives.

Paragraph:
We generate revenue by licensing and supporting an array of software products, by offering a wide range of services, including cloud-based services to consumers and businesses, by designing, manufacturing, and
selling devices that integrate with our cloud-based services, and by delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees; designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling
our products and services; datacenter costs in support of our cloud-based services; and income taxes.

Paragraph:
Much of our focus in fiscal year
2016 was toward transforming our organization to support our strategy of building best-in-class platforms and productivity services for a mobile-first, cloud-first world. We achieved product development milestones, implemented organizational
changes, and made strategic and tactical moves to support the three central ambitions that support our strategy: reinventing productivity and business processes; building the intelligent cloud platform; and creating more personal computing.

Paragraph:
Highlights from fiscal year 2016 included:

Mobility customers nearly doubled year-over-year to over 33,000.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Windows 10 is now active on more than 350 million devices around the world.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Xbox Live monthly active users grew 33% year-over-year to 49 million.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate is calculated by multiplying revenue for the last month of the quarter by twelve for Office 365 commercial,
Azure, Dynamics Online, and other cloud properties.

Paragraph:
In June 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to
acquire LinkedIn for $196 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $26.2 billion, inclusive of LinkedIns net cash (the Merger Agreement). We will finance the transaction primarily through the issuance of new indebtedness. The
Merger Agreement has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both Microsoft and LinkedIn, and we expect the acquisition will close in calendar year 2016, subject to approval by LinkedIns shareholders, satisfaction of certain
regulatory approvals, and other customary closing conditions. The acquisition is anticipated to accelerate the growth of LinkedIn, as well as Office 365 and Dynamics.

Paragraph:
In May 2016, we announced the sale of our entry-level feature phone business for $350 million. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2016, subject to regulatory approvals and other closing
conditions.

Paragraph:
In July 2015, we announced a plan to restructure our phone business to better focus and align resources. In May 2016, we
announced plans to further streamline our smartphone hardware business. These changes in the phone business reinforce our strategy to create a vibrant Windows ecosystem with a single set of experiences across our first-party device family and
original equipment manufacturer (OEM) offerings. Part of this strategy involves focusing our phone devices on a narrower range of customer categories and differentiating through the combination of hardware and software we are uniquely
positioned to offer. As anticipated, our change in phone strategy resulted in a reduction in units sold and associated expenses in fiscal year 2016, and this trend is expected to continue in fiscal year 2017.

Paragraph:
Industry Trends

Paragraph:
Our industry is dynamic
and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At
Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces.

Paragraph:
Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks

Paragraph:
The market for software, devices, and cloud-based services is dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and
devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the users choice
of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in devices and infrastructure will continue to increase our operating
costs and may decrease our operating margins.

Paragraph:
Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees.
We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. Microsoft competes for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow ones career across
many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic.

Paragraph:
Item 7

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many
of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign
currencies throughout fiscal year 2015, and continuing into fiscal year 2016, negatively impacted reported revenue and reduced reported expenses from our international operations.

Paragraph:
See a discussion of these factors and other risks under Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K).

Paragraph:
Seasonality

Paragraph:
Our revenue historically has
fluctuated quarterly and has generally been highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers.

Paragraph:
Unearned Revenue

Paragraph:
Quarterly and annual revenue is impacted
by the deferral of revenue, primarily including:

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Revenue deferred on Windows 10 licenses to reflect ratable recognition over the life of the device.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Revenue deferred on bundled products and services (Bundled Offerings).

Paragraph:
If our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-based products and services,
the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable.

Paragraph:
Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue

Paragraph:
Due to the growth in our cloud-based solutions,
service revenue exceeded 10% of total revenue for the first time in fiscal year 2016. As a result, we have separately disclosed product revenue and service and other revenue on our consolidated income statements.

Paragraph:
Product revenue includes sales from operating systems; cross-device productivity applications; server applications; business solution applications;
desktop and server management tools; software development tools; video games; hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, phones, other intelligent devices, and related accessories; and training and certification of computer
system integrators and developers.

Paragraph:
Service and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with
software, services, platforms, and content such as Office 365, Azure, Dynamics CRM Online, and Xbox Live; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising.

included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. Segment information appearing in Note 21  Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of
this Form 10-K) is also presented on this basis. All differences between our internal management reporting basis and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP), along with certain corporate-level and other
activity, are included in Corporate and Other.

Paragraph:
In June 2015, we announced a change in organizational structure to align to our
strategic direction as a productivity and platform company. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, our chief operating decision maker, who is also our Chief Executive Officer, requested changes in the information that he regularly reviews for
purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. As a result, beginning in fiscal year 2016, we report our financial performance based on our new segments, Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal
Computing, and analyze operating income as the measure of segment profitability. We have recast certain previously reported amounts to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor segment performance.

Gross margin

Paragraph:
Operating income

Paragraph:
Diluted earnings per share

Paragraph:
Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015

Paragraph:
Revenue decreased $8.3 billion or 9%, primarily due to the impact of the net revenue deferral from Windows 10 of $6.6 billion and an unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately $3.8 billion or 4%. Windows
10 revenue is primarily recognized at the time of billing in the More Personal Computing segment, and the deferral and subsequent recognition of revenue is reflected in Corporate and Other. More Personal Computing revenue decreased, mainly due to
lower revenue from Devices and Windows, offset in part by higher revenue from search advertising and Gaming. Intelligent Cloud revenue increased, primarily due to higher revenue from server products and cloud services and Enterprise Services.
Productivity and Business Processes revenue increased slightly, driven by an increase in Office and Dynamics revenue.

Paragraph:
Operating income
increased $2.0 billion or 11%, primarily due to a decrease in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses and sales and marketing expenses, offset in part by lower gross margin. Gross margin decreased $8.0 billion or 13%, driven by the
decline in revenue as discussed above, and included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately $3.3 billion or 5%. Productivity and Business Processes and More Personal Computing gross margin decreased, offset in part by higher gross
margin from Intelligent Cloud.

Paragraph:
Key changes in expenses were:

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Cost of revenue decreased $258 million or 1%, mainly due to a reduction in phone sales, driven by the change in strategy for the phone business, offset in
part by growth in commercial cloud and search advertising.

Paragraph:

our phone business and restructuring charges associated with our phone business restructuring plans.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Sales and marketing expenses decreased $1.0 billion or 6%, driven by a reduction in phone expenses and a favorable foreign currency impact of approximately
2%.

Paragraph:
Diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $2.10 for fiscal year 2016. Current year diluted EPS was
negatively impacted by the net revenue deferral from Windows 10 and impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses, which resulted in a decrease to diluted EPS of $0.69, and favorably impacted by the adoption of new accounting guidance related
to stock-based compensation, which resulted in an increase to diluted EPS of $0.05. Diluted EPS was $1.48 for fiscal year 2015. Prior year diluted EPS was negatively impacted by impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses, which resulted in
a decrease to diluted EPS of $1.15.

Research and development expenses increased $665 million or 6%, mainly due to increased investment in new products and services, including phone expenses,
offset in part by reduced headcount-related expenses.

business PC market. Windows OEM non-Pro revenue declined, mainly due to an increased mix of opening price point devices sold, and declines in the consumer PC market. Windows Phone revenue,
including related patent licensing, decreased $1.4 billion or 55%, primarily due to prior year revenue associated with our joint strategic initiatives with Nokia that terminated when we acquired NDS.

Paragraph:
More Personal Computing operating income decreased $938 million or 17%, primarily due to higher operating expenses, as well as a reduction in gross
margin. Gross margin decreased $364 million or 2%, reflecting a reduction in Windows gross margin, offset in part by an increase in devices gross margin. Cost of revenue increased $5.1 billion or 28%, driven by higher phones cost of revenue, as well
as higher Xbox Live and search infrastructure costs, offset in part by a reduction in Windows Phone cost of revenue. Phones cost of revenue increased $4.8 billion, reflecting a full year of phone sales in fiscal year 2015. Windows Phone cost of
revenue decreased $897 million, driven by prior year costs associated with our joint strategic initiatives with Nokia that terminated when we acquired NDS. Operating expenses increased $574 million or 4%, driven by a full year of NDS expenses.
Research and development expenses increased $346 million or 5%, mainly due to increased investment in new product and services, including higher phone expenses, offset in part by reduced headcount-related expenses. Sales and marketing expenses
increased $211 million or 3%, primarily due to higher phone expenses, offset in part by a decline in advertising and other marketing program costs.

Paragraph:
Corporate and Other

Paragraph:
Corporate and Other
revenue primarily comprises certain revenue deferrals, including those related to Windows 10, Bundled Offerings, and video games. Corporate and Other operating income (loss) primarily comprises revenue deferrals and corporate-level activity not
specifically allocated to a segment, including impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses.

Paragraph:
Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015

Paragraph:
Corporate and Other revenue decreased $6.9 billion, primarily due to the impact of the net revenue deferral from Windows 10. During
fiscal year 2016, we deferred net revenue from Windows 10 of $6.6 billion. During fiscal year 2015, we recognized a net $303 million of previously deferred revenue related to Bundled Offerings.

Paragraph:
Corporate and Other operating loss decreased $2.0 billion, primarily due to an $8.9 billion reduction in impairment, integration, and restructuring
expenses, driven by prior year goodwill and asset impairment charges related to our phone business, offset in part by lower revenue.

Paragraph:
Fiscal year
2015 compared with fiscal year 2014

Paragraph:
Corporate and Other revenue increased $613 million, primarily due to the timing of net revenue
deferrals compared to the prior year. During fiscal year 2015, we recognized a net $303 million of previously deferred revenue related to Bundled Offerings. During fiscal year 2014, we deferred a net $349 million of revenue related to Bundled
Offerings.

Paragraph:
Corporate and Other operating loss increased $9.3 billion, primarily due to higher impairment, integration, and
restructuring expenses, offset in part by increased revenue.

IMPAIRMENT, INTEGRATION, AND RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES

Paragraph:
Impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses include costs associated with the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets related to our
phone business, employee severance expenses and costs associated with the consolidation of facilities and manufacturing operations related to restructuring activities, and systems consolidation and other business integration expenses associated with
our acquisition of NDS.

Paragraph:
Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015

Paragraph:
Impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses were $1.1 billion for fiscal year 2016, compared to $10.0 billion for fiscal year 2015.

Paragraph:
During fiscal year 2016, we recorded $630 million of asset impairment charges related to our phone business. We also recorded $480
million of restructuring charges, including employee severance expenses and contract termination costs, primarily related to our previously announced phone business restructuring plans.

Paragraph:
During fiscal year 2015, we recognized impairment charges of $7.5 billion related to our phone business. Our annual goodwill impairment test as of
May 1, 2015 indicated that the carrying value of our previous Phone Hardware reporting unit goodwill exceeded its estimated fair value. Accordingly, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $5.1 billion, reducing our Phone Hardware reporting
unit goodwill from $5.4 billion to $116 million, net of foreign currency remeasurements, as well as an impairment charge of $2.2 billion related to the write-down of our Phone Hardware reporting unit intangible assets. All remaining goodwill and
intangible assets are included in our Devices reporting unit, within More Personal Computing under our current segment structure. Restructuring charges were $2.1 billion, including employee severance expenses and the write-down of certain assets in
connection with our restructuring activities. Integration expenses associated with the acquisition of NDS were $435 million in fiscal year 2015.

Paragraph:
Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014

Paragraph:
We use derivative instruments to: manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and
credit; enhance investment returns; and facilitate portfolio diversification. Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. Other than those
derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities and gains (losses) on certain balance
sheet amounts from foreign exchange rate changes.

Paragraph:
Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015

Paragraph:
Dividends and interest income increased due to higher portfolio balances and slightly higher yields on fixed-income securities. Interest expense
increased due to higher outstanding long-term debt. Net recognized gains on investments decreased primarily due to higher other-than-temporary impairments and lower gains on sales of fixed-income securities, offset in part by higher gains on sales
of equity securities. Other-than-temporary impairments were $322 million in fiscal year 2016, compared with $183 million in fiscal year 2015. Net losses on derivatives increased due to higher losses on currency and equity contracts and lower gains
on interest rate contracts in the current period as compared to the prior period, offset in part by lower losses on commodity contracts. For fiscal year 2016, other reflects recognized losses from divestitures and certain joint ventures.

Paragraph:

Dividends and interest income decreased due to lower yields on fixed-income securities, offset in part by higher portfolio balances. Interest expense increased due to higher outstanding long-term debt. Net
recognized gains on investments increased primarily due to higher gains on sales of equity securities, offset in part by higher other-than-temporary impairments. Other-than-temporary impairments were $183 million in fiscal year 2015, compared with
$106 million in fiscal year 2014. Net losses on derivatives increased due to losses on commodity contracts in fiscal year 2015 as compared to gains in fiscal year 2014, offset in part by lower losses on currency and equity contracts. For fiscal year
2015, other reflects recognized losses from certain joint ventures and divestitures.

INCOME TAXES

Paragraph:
Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015

Paragraph:
Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2016 and 2015 was 15% and 34%, respectively. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in
foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico.

Paragraph:
The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to changes in the mix of our income
before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries including the impact of net

Paragraph:
revenue deferrals related to sales of Windows 10, tax benefits from the adoption of the new accounting guidance relating to stock-based compensation, and distributions from foreign affiliates.
The fiscal year 2015 effective tax rate included the tax impact of losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we may not realize a tax benefit, primarily as a result of impairment and restructuring charges.

Paragraph:
The mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic
distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. We supply our Windows PC operating system to customers through our U.S. regional operating center, while we supply the Microsoft Office system and our server products and tools to
customers through our foreign regional operations centers. In fiscal year 2016, our U.S. loss before income taxes was $325 million and our foreign income before income taxes was $20.1 billion. Net revenue deferrals related to sales of Windows 10
negatively impacted our fiscal year 2016 U.S. loss before income taxes by $6.0 billion and foreign income before income taxes by $588 million. In fiscal year 2015, our U.S. income before income taxes was $7.4 billion and our foreign income before
income taxes was $11.1 billion. Impairment, integration, and restructuring expense relating to our phone business decreased our fiscal year 2015 U.S income before income taxes by $1.1 billion and foreign income before income taxes by
$8.9 billion.

Paragraph:
On July 27, 2015, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner related to the treatment
of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement. The IRSs decision to appeal on February 19, 2016 prolongs the uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome of the Altera case, and we do not expect to adjust
our consolidated financial statements until there is a final resolution of this case.

Paragraph:
Tax contingencies and other income tax
liabilities were $11.8 billion and $12.1 billion as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. This decrease relates primarily to tax credits available for carryover and a partial settlement of the
IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009, offset by increases relating to intercompany transfer pricing.

Paragraph:
While we settled a portion of the
IRS audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, and settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, we remain under audit for those years. In February
2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. As of June 30, 2016, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing, which could have a significant
impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution
of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We also continue to be subject to
examination by the IRS for tax years 2010 to 2016.

Paragraph:
We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations
in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2016, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial
statements.

Paragraph:
Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014

Paragraph:
Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2015 and 2014 was 34% and 21%, respectively. The fiscal year 2015 effective rate increased by 13%, primarily due to goodwill and asset impairments and restructuring charges
recorded in fiscal year 2015, most of which did not generate a tax benefit. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates resulting from producing and distributing our
products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico. In fiscal year 2015, this reduction was mostly offset by losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we may not realize a tax benefit,
primarily as a result of impairment and restructuring charges.

Paragraph:
Changes in the mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and

comprised 60% and 74%, respectively, of our income before income taxes.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Paragraph:
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments

Paragraph:
Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $113.2 billion as of June 30, 2016, compared with $96.5 billion as of June 30,
2015. Equity and other investments were $10.4 billion as of June 30, 2016, compared with $12.1 billion as of June 30, 2015. Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation. They
consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated
securities in order to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to
certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.

Paragraph:
Of the cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of June 30, 2016, $108.9 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries and would
be subject to material repatriation tax effects. The amount of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds (primarily currency and other local regulatory)
was $2.4 billion. As of June 30, 2016, approximately 83% of the cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in U.S. government and agency securities, approximately 4% were invested in corporate
notes and bonds of U.S. companies, and approximately 5% were invested in U.S. mortgage- and asset-backed securities, all of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The remaining cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our foreign
subsidiaries were invested in foreign securities.

Paragraph:
Securities lending

Paragraph:
We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our consolidated balance sheets. Cash and/or security interests are
received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Collateral received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. Our securities
lending payable balance was $294 million as of June 30, 2016. Our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for fiscal year 2016 were $361 million and $1.2 billion, respectively. Intra-year variances in the amount of securities
loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities.

Paragraph:
Valuation

Paragraph:
In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our
financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, and U.S. government securities. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our
Level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, common and preferred stock, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, U.S. government and agency securities, and certificates of deposit. Level 3 investments are valued
using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.

Paragraph:
Item 7

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2
investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the
investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker
prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all of our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these
investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and
independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.

Paragraph:
Cash Flows

Paragraph:
Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015

Paragraph:
Cash flows from operations increased $3.7
billion to $33.3 billion during the fiscal year, mainly due to lower operating expenditures and a reduction in materials and production costs, offset in part by a decrease in cash received from customers. Cash used in financing decreased $1.3
billion to $8.4 billion, mainly due to a $4.6 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments, offset in part by a $1.5 billion increase in cash used for common stock repurchases and a $1.1 billion increase in dividends paid.
Cash used in investing increased $949 million to $24.0 billion, mainly due to a $2.4 billion increase in cash used for additions to property and equipment and a $1.5 billion increase in cash used for net investment purchases, sales, and maturities,
offset in part by a $2.3 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangibles and other assets.

Paragraph:
Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014

Paragraph:
Cash flows from operations decreased $2.8
billion to $29.7 billion, mainly due to an increase in materials and production costs in support of sales growth as well as payments related to restructuring charges and other changes in working capital, offset in part by increases in cash received
from customers. Cash used in financing increased $1.0 billion to $9.7 billion, mainly due to a $7.1 billion increase in cash used for common stock repurchases, offset in part by a $6.7 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of
repayments. Cash used in investing increased $4.2 billion to $23.0 billion, mainly due to a $5.5 billion increase in cash used for net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, partially offset by a $2.2 billion decrease in cash used for
acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets.

Paragraph:
Debt

Paragraph:
We issued debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate
environment. The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of
existing debt. See Note 12  Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.

Paragraph:
Unearned Revenue

Paragraph:
Unearned revenue as of
June 30, 2016 was comprised mainly of unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the
agreement or annually at the beginning of each coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue as of June 30, 2016 also included payments for: Windows 10 licenses;
post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; Office 365 subscriptions; Xbox Live subscriptions; Microsoft Dynamics business solutions products; Skype prepaid credits and subscriptions; Bundled Offerings; and other
offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.

has no expiration date, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. This share repurchase program replaced the share repurchase program that was announced on September 22, 2008 and expired on September 30, 2013. As of
June 30, 2016, $7.1 billion remained of our $40.0 billion share repurchase program. While the program has no expiration date, we intend to complete it by December 31, 2016. All repurchases were made using cash resources.

Other Planned Uses of Capital

Paragraph:
In June
2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire LinkedIn in an all-cash transaction valued at $26.2 billion, inclusive of LinkedIns net cash. We expect the acquisition will close in calendar year 2016, and we will finance the
transaction primarily through the issuance of new debt.

Paragraph:
We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure,
and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research
and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years in support of our productivity and platform strategy. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales
and support offices and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital
resources.

Paragraph:
Liquidity

Paragraph:
We earn a
significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. As a result, as discussed above under Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments, the majority of our cash, cash
equivalents, and short-term investments are held by foreign subsidiaries. We currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. We expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from
operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt maturities, and material capital
expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our
foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.

Paragraph:
Should we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our operations domestically, for
example to fund significant discretionary activities, such as business acquisitions and share repurchases, we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances. These
alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, increased interest expense, or dilution of our earnings. We have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates.

Paragraph:
RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE

Paragraph:
See Note 1  Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.

Paragraph:
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Paragraph:
Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by managements application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of
investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.

Paragraph:
Revenue Recognition

Paragraph:
Revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted
for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements.

Paragraph:
Judgment is also required to assess whether
future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products. Certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future
versions of software products and are accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period.

Paragraph:
Software updates are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade, which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered. If it is
determined that implied post-contract customer support (PCS) is being provided, revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied PCS term. If updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade,
revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available.

Paragraph:
Microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various
combinations of software, services, and hardware. Where elements are delivered over different periods of time, and when allowed under U.S. GAAP, revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception
of the arrangement, and revenue is recognized as each element is delivered. We use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to elements: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE), (ii)
third-party evidence, and (iii) best estimate of selling price (ESP). For software elements, we follow the industry-specific software guidance which only allows for the use of VSOE in establishing fair value. Generally, VSOE is the price
charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by management for a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before introduction into the marketplace. ESPs are established as best
estimates of what the selling prices would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. Our process for determining ESPs requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts
and circumstances related to each deliverable.

Paragraph:
In January 2015, we announced Windows 10 would be free to all qualified existing users
of Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. This offer differs from historical offers preceding the launch of new versions of Windows as it is being made

Paragraph:

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
available for free to existing users in addition to new customers after the offer announcement. We evaluated the nature and accounting treatment of the Windows 10 offer and determined that it
represents a marketing and promotional activity, in part because the offer is being made available for free to existing users. As this is a marketing and promotional activity, revenue recognition of new sales of Windows 8 will continue to be
recognized as delivered.

Paragraph:
Customers purchasing a Windows 10 license will receive unspecified updates and upgrades over the life of their
Windows 10 device at no additional cost. As these updates and upgrades will not be sold on a stand-alone basis, we are unable to establish VSOE. Accordingly, revenue from licenses of Windows 10 is recognized ratably over the estimated life of the
related device, which ranges between two to four years.

Paragraph:
We currently are evaluating the impact of the new standard related to revenue
recognition, which we anticipate will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 1  Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.

Paragraph:
Impairment of Investment Securities

Paragraph:
We review investments quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that
considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt
instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans
to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including
industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense), net and a new
cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.

Paragraph:
Goodwill

Paragraph:
We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate
our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on
an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a
significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.

Paragraph:
Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units,
and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of
future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.

Paragraph:
The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market
conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.

Paragraph:
Research and Development Costs

Paragraph:
Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is
established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological
feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. The amortization of these costs
is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.

Paragraph:
Legal and Other Contingencies

Paragraph:
The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency
such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be
accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial
statements.

Paragraph:
Income Taxes

Paragraph:
The
objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys
financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of
the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also
provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is
required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated
financial statements.

Paragraph:
Inventories

Paragraph:
Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. We regularly review
inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels,
pricing strategy, and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.

STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Paragraph:
Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report.
The consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on managements estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Paragraph:
The Company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are
safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing consolidated financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. These systems are augmented by written policies, an
organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits.

Paragraph:
The Company engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial
reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).

Paragraph:
The Board of Directors,
through its Audit Committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the Company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities
and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the Audit Committee.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT
MARKET RISK

Paragraph:
RISKS

Paragraph:
We are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, equity prices, and commodity prices. A portion of these risks is hedged, but they may impact our consolidated financial
statements.

Paragraph:
Foreign Currency

Paragraph:
Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and
use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar.

Paragraph:
Interest Rate

Paragraph:
Our fixed-income
portfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities, consisting primarily of investment-grade securities. The credit risk and average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain
global and domestic fixed-income indices. In addition, we use To Be Announced forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed securities.

Paragraph:
Equity

Paragraph:
Our equity portfolio consists of
global, developed, and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk. We manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices.

Paragraph:
Commodity

Paragraph:
We use broad-based
commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification. Our investment portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities, including precious metals, energy, and grain. We manage these exposures relative to global
commodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices.

Paragraph:
VALUE-AT-RISK

Paragraph:
We use a value-at-risk (VaR) model to estimate and quantify our market risks. VaR is the expected loss, for a given confidence level,
in the fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon. The VaR model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, including determinations of other-than-temporary losses in fair value in
accordance with U.S. GAAP, but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign exchange
rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices, assuming normal market conditions.

Paragraph:
The VaR is calculated as the total loss
that will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level or, alternatively stated, the losses could exceed the VaR in 25 out of 1,000 cases. Several risk factors are not captured in the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, and
legal risk.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Paragraph:
NOTE 1  ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Paragraph:
Accounting Principles

Paragraph:
The consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP).

Paragraph:
We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation, with no impact on consolidated net income or cash flows.

Paragraph:
Principles of Consolidation

Paragraph:
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Equity investments through which we are able to exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary
beneficiary of the investees activities are accounted for using the equity method. Investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which do not have readily determinable fair values are
accounted for under the cost method.

Paragraph:
Segment Information

Paragraph:
In June 2015, we announced a change in organizational structure to align to our strategic direction as a productivity and platform company. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, our chief operating decision
maker, who is also our Chief Executive Officer, requested changes in the information that he regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. As a result, beginning in fiscal year 2016, we report our financial
performance based on our new segments described in Note 21  Segment Information and Geographic Data. We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor segment performance during fiscal year
2016. This change primarily impacted Note 10  Goodwill, Note 15  Unearned Revenue, and Note 21  Segment Information and Geographic Data, with no impact on consolidated net income or cash flows.

Paragraph:
Estimates and Assumptions

Paragraph:
Preparing
financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates include: loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of,
and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; allowances for product returns; the market value of
and volume of demand for our inventory; and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates. Examples of assumptions include: the elements comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades or enhancements and new products; when
technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining when investment impairments are
other-than-temporary. Actual results and outcomes may differ from managements estimates and assumptions.

Paragraph:
Foreign Currencies

Paragraph:
Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are
translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income (OCI).

Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue

Paragraph:
Service revenue exceeded 10% of total revenue for the first time in fiscal year 2016. As a result, we have separately disclosed product revenue and
service and other revenue on our consolidated income statements.

Paragraph:
Product revenue includes sales from operating systems; cross-device
productivity applications; server applications; business solution applications; desktop and server management tools; software development tools; video games; hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, phones, other intelligent
devices, and related accessories; and training and certification of computer system integrators and developers.

Paragraph:
Service and other
revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as Office 365, Microsoft Azure (Azure), Microsoft Dynamics (Dynamics) CRM Online, and Xbox Live;
solution support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising.

Paragraph:
Revenue Recognition

Paragraph:
Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable,
and collectability is probable. Revenue generally is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.

Paragraph:
Revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted
for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements.

Paragraph:
Microsoft enters into arrangements that can
include various combinations of software, services, and hardware. Where elements are delivered over different periods of time, and when allowed under U.S. GAAP, revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their relative selling prices
at the inception of the arrangement, and revenue is recognized as each element is delivered. We use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to elements: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value
(VSOE), (ii) third-party evidence, and (iii) best estimate of selling price (ESP). For software elements, we follow the industry specific software guidance which only allows for the use of VSOE in establishing fair
value. Generally, VSOE is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by management for a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before introduction into the marketplace.
ESPs are established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. Our process for determining ESPs requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time
depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable.

Paragraph:
Revenue for retail packaged products, products licensed
to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and perpetual licenses under certain volume licensing programs generally is recognized as products are shipped or made available.

Paragraph:
Technology guarantee programs are accounted for as multiple-element arrangements as customers receive free or significantly discounted rights to
use upcoming new versions of a software product if they license existing versions of the product during the eligibility period. Revenue is allocated between the existing product and the new product, and revenue allocated to the new product is
deferred until that version is delivered. The revenue allocation is based on the VSOE of fair value of the products. The VSOE of fair value for upcoming new products are based on the price determined by management having the relevant authority when
the element is not yet sold separately, but is expected to be sold in the near future at the price set by management.

Paragraph:
Software updates
that will be provided free of charge are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade and create a multiple-element arrangement, which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the
upgrade is delivered, or if it is determined that implied post-contract customer support (PCS) is being provided, the arrangement is accounted for as a multiple-element arrangement and all

Paragraph:

Paragraph:


Paragraph:


Paragraph:
PART II

Paragraph:
Item 8

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied PCS term when the VSOE of fair value does not exist. If updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade,
revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available.

Paragraph:
Customers purchasing a Windows 10 license will receive
unspecified updates and upgrades over the life of their Windows 10 device at no additional cost. As these updates and upgrades will not be sold on a stand-alone basis, we are unable to establish VSOE of fair value. Accordingly, revenue from licenses
of Windows 10 is recognized ratably over the estimated life of the related device, which ranges between two to four years.

Paragraph:
Certain
volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of software products, which we have determined are additional software products and are therefore accounted
for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period. Arrangements that include term-based licenses for current products with the right to use unspecified future versions of the
software during the coverage period, are also accounted for as subscriptions, with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period. Revenue from cloud-based services arrangements that allow for the use of a hosted software product or service
over a contractually determined period of time without taking possession of software are accounted for as subscriptions with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period beginning on the date the
service is made available to customers. Revenue from cloud-based services arrangements that are provided on a consumption basis (for example, the amount of storage used in a particular period) is recognized commensurate with the customer utilization
of such resources.

Paragraph:
Some volume licensing arrangements include time-based subscriptions for cloud-based services and software offerings
that are accounted for as subscriptions. These arrangements are considered multiple-element arrangements. However, because all elements are accounted for as subscriptions and have the same coverage period and delivery pattern, they have the same
revenue recognition timing.

Paragraph:
Revenue related to Microsoft Surface (Surface) devices, Xbox consoles, games published by us,
phones, and other hardware components is generally recognized when ownership is transferred to the resellers or to end customers when selling directly through Microsoft retail stores and online marketplaces. A portion of revenue may be deferred when
these products are combined with software elements, and/or services. Revenue related to licensing for games published by third parties for use on the Xbox consoles is recognized when games are manufactured by the game publishers.

Paragraph:
Display advertising revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed. Search advertising revenue is recognized when the ad appears in the
search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Consulting services revenue is recognized as services are rendered, generally based on the negotiated hourly rate in the consulting arrangement and the number of
hours worked during the period. Consulting revenue for fixed-price services arrangements is recognized as services are provided.

Paragraph:
Cost of Revenue

Paragraph:
Cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to
product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on PCs sold by OEMs, to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs incurred to support and maintain
Internet-based products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized software development
costs. Capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products.

Paragraph:
Product Warranty

Paragraph:
We provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is
recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the
product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security
patches, over the estimated life of the software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.

Paragraph:
Research and Development

Paragraph:
Research and development expenses include payroll, employee
benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to
translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological
feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. Once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the
estimated lives of the products.

Paragraph:
Sales and Marketing

Paragraph:
Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising,
promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $1.6 billion, $1.9 billion, and $2.3 billion in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

Paragraph:
Stock-Based Compensation

Paragraph:
Compensation cost
for stock awards is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related service period using the straight-line method. The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of
our common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) is measured as the discount the employee is entitled
to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.

Paragraph:
Income Taxes

Paragraph:
Income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, the provision for U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of international
subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently reinvested, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary
differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income taxes are classified as long-term on our
consolidated balance sheets.

Paragraph:
Fair Value Measurements

Paragraph:
We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the
market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are:

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Level 1
  inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. Our Level 1 non-derivative
investments primarily include U.S. government securities, domestic and international equities, and actively traded mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
60

Paragraph:


Paragraph:


Paragraph:
PART II

Paragraph:
Item 8

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Level 2
  inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in
markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the
assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and
forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. Our Level 2 non-derivative investments consist primarily of corporate notes and bonds, common and preferred stock, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, U.S. government and agency securities,
and foreign government bonds. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities primarily include certain over-the-counter option and swap contracts.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Level 3
  inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect managements estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in
pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 non-derivative assets primarily comprise investments in common and
preferred stock, and goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.

Paragraph:
We measure certain assets, including our cost and equity method investments, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis
when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. The fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and
discounted cash flow projections. An impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other-than-temporary.

Paragraph:
Our other current financial assets and our current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.

Paragraph:
Financial Instruments

Paragraph:
Investments

Paragraph:
We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments.
Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. All cash equivalents
and short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in OCI.

Paragraph:
Equity and other investments classified as long-term include both debt and equity instruments. Debt and publicly-traded equity
securities are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in the market value of available-for-sale securities, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are
reflected in OCI. Common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost or using the equity method.

Paragraph:
We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. These transactions are accounted for as secured borrowings and
the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our consolidated balance sheets. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent
and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.

Paragraph:
Investments are
considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. We employ a systematic methodology on a
quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative

evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of
debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have
plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including
industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense), net and a new
cost basis in the investment is established.

Paragraph:
Derivatives

Paragraph:
Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and
the resulting designation.

Paragraph:
For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains (losses) are recognized in earnings in
the periods of change together with the offsetting losses (gains) on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For options designated as fair value hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness
and are recognized in earnings.

Paragraph:
For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains (losses)
on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of OCI and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the
assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. Gains (losses) on derivatives representing either hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings.

Paragraph:
For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains (losses) from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income
(expense), net. Other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities, which
are recorded as a component of OCI until the securities are sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) into other income (expense), net.

Paragraph:
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Paragraph:
The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the
allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:

quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our
inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.

Paragraph:
Property and Equipment

Paragraph:
Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the
estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three to seven years; computer equipment, two to three
years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, three to 20 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. Land is not depreciated.

Paragraph:
Goodwill

Paragraph:
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or
one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.

Paragraph:
Intangible Assets

Paragraph:
All of our
intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to 15 years. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into
account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired.

Recent Accounting
Guidance

Paragraph:
Recently adopted accounting guidance

Paragraph:
Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting

Paragraph:
In March 2016, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new standard that changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. The new guidance requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded in the income
statement when stock awards vest or are settled. In addition, cash flows related to excess tax benefits will no longer be separately classified as a financing activity apart from other income tax cash flows. The standard also allows us to repurchase
more of an employees vesting shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting, clarifies that all cash payments made to tax authorities on an employees behalf for withheld shares should be presented as a
financing activity on our cash flows statement, and provides an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. The new standard is effective for us beginning July 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted.

Paragraph:
We elected to early adopt the new guidance in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 which requires us to reflect any adjustments as of July 1,
2015, the beginning of the annual period that includes the interim period of adoption. The primary impact of adoption was the recognition of excess tax benefits in our provision for income taxes rather than paid-in capital for all periods in fiscal
year 2016. Additional amendments to the accounting for income taxes and minimum statutory withholding tax requirements had no impact to retained earnings as of July 1, 2015, where the cumulative effect of these changes are required to be
recorded. We have elected to continue to estimate forfeitures expected to occur to determine the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each period.

Paragraph:
We elected to apply the presentation requirements for cash flows related to excess tax benefits retrospectively to all periods presented which resulted in an increase to both net cash from operations and net cash
used in financing of $588 million and $271 million for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The presentation requirements for cash flows related to employee taxes paid for withheld shares had no impact to any of the periods
presented on our consolidated cash flows statements since such cash flows have historically been presented as a financing activity.

Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recognition of excess tax benefits in our provision

Paragraph:
Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes

Paragraph:
In November 2015, the FASB issued guidance that requires companies to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as
noncurrent on the balance sheet rather than separately disclosing deferred taxes as current and noncurrent. This standard is effective for us beginning July 1, 2017, and can be early adopted and applied either prospectively or retrospectively
to all periods presented upon adoption.

Paragraph:
We elected to early adopt the new guidance in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 on a
retrospective basis. While the guidance changes the manner in which deferred taxes are classified on the balance sheet, we are still required to offset deferred tax assets and liabilities for each taxpaying component within a tax jurisdiction.
Adoption of the new standard impacted our previously reported results as follows:

Paragraph:
Financial Instruments  Credit Losses

Paragraph:
In June 2016, the FASB issued a new standard to
replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. For
trade and other receivables, loans, and other financial instruments, we will be required to use a forward-looking expected loss model rather than the incurred loss model for recognizing credit losses which reflects losses that are probable. Credit
losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities will also be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities. The new standard will be effective for us beginning
July 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted beginning July 1, 2019. Application of the amendments is through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date. We are currently evaluating the impact of this
standard on our consolidated financial statements.

Paragraph:
Leases

Paragraph:
In February 2016, the FASB issued a new standard related to leases to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance
sheet. Most prominent among the amendments is the recognition of assets and liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous U.S. GAAP. Under the new standard, disclosures are required to meet the objective of
enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. We will be required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified
retrospective approach.

Paragraph:
The new standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We
currently anticipate early adoption of the new standard effective July 1, 2017 in conjunction with our adoption of the new revenue standard. Our ability to early adopt is dependent on system readiness, including software procured from
third-party providers, and the completion of our analysis of information necessary to restate prior period financial statements.

Paragraph:
Financial Instruments  Recognition, Measurement, Presentation, and Disclosure

Paragraph:
In January 2016, the FASB issued a new standard to amend certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial
instruments. Most prominent among the amendments is the requirement for changes in the fair value of our equity investments, with certain exceptions, to be recognized through net income rather than OCI. The new standard will be effective for us
beginning July 1, 2018. The application of the amendments will result in a cumulative-effect adjustment to our consolidated balance sheets as of the effective date. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated
financial statements.

Paragraph:
Revenue from Contracts with Customers

Paragraph:
In May 2014, the FASB issued a new standard related to revenue recognition. Under the new standard, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount
that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from
contracts with customers. The FASB has recently issued several amendments to the standard, including clarification on accounting for licenses of intellectual property and identifying performance obligations.

Paragraph:
The guidance permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or
retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the cumulative catch-up transition method). We currently anticipate adopting the standard using the full retrospective
method to restate each prior reporting period presented.

Paragraph:
The new standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2018, and
adoption as of the original effective date of July 1, 2017 is permitted. We currently anticipate early adoption of the new standard effective July 1, 2017. Our ability to early adopt using the full retrospective method is dependent on
system readiness, including software procured from third-party providers, and the completion of our analysis of information necessary to restate prior period financial statements.

Paragraph:
We anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. While we are continuing to assess all potential
impacts of the standard, we currently believe the most significant impact relates to our accounting for software license revenue. We expect revenue related to hardware, cloud offerings, and professional services to remain substantially unchanged.
Specifically, under the new standard we expect to recognize Windows 10 revenue predominantly at the time of billing rather than ratably over the life of the related device. We also expect to recognize license revenue at the time of billing rather
than over the subscription period from certain multi-year commercial software subscriptions that include both software licenses and Software Assurance. Due to the complexity of certain of our commercial license subscription contracts, the actual
revenue recognition treatment required under the standard will be dependent on contract-specific terms, and may vary in some instances from recognition at the time of billing.

Paragraph:
We currently believe that the net change in Windows 10 revenue from period to period is indicative of the net change in revenue we expect from the adoption of the new standard.

NOTE 2  EARNINGS PER SHARE

Paragraph:
Basic earnings per share (EPS) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of

We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Our objectives for
holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible.

Paragraph:
Foreign Currency

Paragraph:
Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge
positions. Option and forward contracts are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future and are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese
yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar. As of June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $8.4 billion and $9.8 billion, respectively.

Paragraph:
Foreign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are
designated as fair value hedging instruments. As of June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $5.3 billion for both periods.

Paragraph:
Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on certain
balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures. As of June 30, 2016, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $12.0 billion and $11.7 billion, respectively. As of
June 30, 2015, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $9.7 billion and $11.0 billion, respectively.

Paragraph:
Equity

Paragraph:
Securities held in our equity and
other investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. Market price risk is managed relative to broad-based global and domestic equity indices using certain convertible preferred investments, options, futures, and swap contracts not
designated as hedging instruments. From time to time, to hedge our price risk, we may use and designate equity derivatives as hedging instruments, including puts, calls, swaps, and forwards. As of June 30, 2016, the total notional amounts
of equity contracts purchased and sold for managing market price risk were $1.3 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, of which $737 million and $986 million, respectively, were designated as hedging instruments. As of June 30, 2015, the total
notional amounts of equity contracts purchased and sold for managing market price risk were $2.2 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, of which $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, were designated as hedging instruments.

Paragraph:
Interest Rate

Paragraph:
Securities held in our
fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using
exchange-traded option and futures contracts, and over-the-counter swap and option contracts, none of which are designated as hedging instruments. As of June 30, 2016, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and
sold were $328 million and $2.4 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2015, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $1.0 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively.

Paragraph:
In addition, we use To Be Announced forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed
securities. These meet the definition of a derivative instrument in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the total notional derivative amounts of
mortgage contracts purchased were $548 million and $812 million, respectively.

Paragraph:
Credit

Paragraph:
Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default swap contracts, not
designated as hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. We use credit default swaps as they are a low-cost method of managing exposure to individual credit risks or
groups of credit risks. As of June 30, 2016, the total notional amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were $440 million and $273 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2015, the total notional amounts of credit contracts purchased
and sold were $618 million and $430 million, respectively.

Commodity

Paragraph:
We use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and to facilitate portfolio diversification. We use swaps, futures, and option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to generate and
manage exposures to broad-based commodity indices. We use derivatives on commodities as they can be low-cost alternatives to the purchase and storage of a variety of commodities, including, but not limited to, precious metals, energy, and grain. As
of June 30, 2016, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $631 million and $162 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2015, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $882
million and $316 million, respectively.

Paragraph:
Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features

Paragraph:
Certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured
debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to
over-the-counter derivatives. As of June 30, 2016, our long-term unsecured debt rating was AAA, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral was required to be posted.

Mojang Synergies AB

Paragraph:
On
November 6, 2014, we acquired Mojang Synergies AB (Mojang), the Swedish video game developer of the Minecraft gaming franchise, for $2.5 billion in cash, net of cash acquired. The addition of Minecraft and its community enhances our
gaming portfolio across Windows, Xbox, and other ecosystems besides our own. The significant classes of assets and liabilities to which we allocated the purchase price were goodwill of $1.8 billion and identifiable intangible assets of $928 million,
primarily marketing-related (trade names). The goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition is primarily attributable to anticipated synergies from future growth, and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. We assigned the
goodwill to More Personal Computing under our current segment structure. Identifiable intangible assets were assigned a total weighted-average amortization period of 6.3 years. Mojang has been included in our consolidated results of operations since
the acquisition date.

Paragraph:
Nokias Devices and Services Business

Paragraph:
On April 25, 2014, we acquired substantially all of Nokia Corporations (Nokia) Devices and Services business (NDS) for a total purchase price of $9.4 billion, including cash
acquired of $1.5 billion (the Acquisition). The purchase price consisted primarily of cash of $7.1 billion and Nokias repurchase of convertible notes of $2.1 billion, which was a non-cash transaction, and liabilities assumed of
$0.2 billion. The Acquisition was expected to accelerate the growth of our Devices business through faster innovation, synergies, and unified branding and marketing.

Paragraph:
The allocation of the purchase price to goodwill was completed as of March 31, 2015. The major classes of assets and liabilities to which we allocated the purchase price were as follows:

Paragraph:
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we recorded $630 million of intangible and fixed
asset impairment charges, and during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we recorded $7.5 billion of goodwill and asset impairment charges. The impairment charges for both periods related to our phone business. These costs are included in
impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses on our consolidated income statement. See Note 10  Goodwill and Note 11  Intangible Assets for additional details.

Paragraph:
In May 2016, we announced an agreement to sell our entry-level feature phone assets for $350 million. The transaction is expected to close in the
second half of calendar year 2016, subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.

Paragraph:
Our consolidated income statement for
fiscal year 2014 included revenue and operating loss of $2.0 billion and $692 million, respectively, attributable to NDS since the Acquisition.

These pro forma results were based on estimates and assumptions, which we believe are reasonable. They are not the

related to purchase accounting adjustments and the elimination of related party transactions between Microsoft and NDS. Acquisition costs and other nonrecurring charges incurred are included in the earliest period presented.

Paragraph:
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, we incurred $21 million of acquisition costs associated with the purchase of NDS. Acquisition costs
are primarily comprised of transaction fees and direct acquisition costs, including legal, finance, consulting, and other professional fees. These costs are included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses on our consolidated income
statement for fiscal year 2014.

Paragraph:
Certain concurrent transactions were recognized separately from the Acquisition. Prior to the
Acquisition, we had joint strategic initiatives with Nokia; this contractual relationship was terminated in conjunction with the Acquisition. No gain or loss was recorded upon termination of this agreement, as it was determined to be at market
value. In addition, we agreed to license Nokias mapping services and will pay Nokia separately for the services provided under a four-year license as they are rendered.

Total goodwill

Paragraph:
The measurement periods for the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed end as soon as information on
the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates becomes available, but do not exceed 12 months. Adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a recasting of the amounts allocated to goodwill retroactive to the periods in
which the acquisitions occurred.

Paragraph:
Any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations and purchase
accounting adjustments are presented as Other in the above table. Also included in Other are business dispositions and transfers between business segments due to reorganizations, as applicable. For fiscal year 2015, a $5.1
billion goodwill impairment charge was included in Other, as discussed below. This goodwill impairment charge was included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses on our consolidated income statement, and reflected in
Corporate and Other in our table of operating income (loss) by segment in Note 21  Segment Information and Geographic Data.

Paragraph:
Our
accumulated goodwill impairment as of both June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $11.3 billion.

Paragraph:
As discussed in Note 21  Segment
Information and Geographic Data, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 our chief operating decision maker requested changes in the information that he regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. This
resulted in a change in our operating segments and reporting units. We allocated goodwill to our new reporting units using a relative fair value approach. In addition, we completed an assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for all reporting
units immediately prior to the reallocation and determined that no impairment existed.

Paragraph:
Goodwill Impairment

Paragraph:
We test goodwill for impairment annually on May 1 at the reporting unit level, primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology with a
peer-based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. We believe use of a discounted cash flow approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the businesses.

Paragraph:
No instances of impairment were identified in our May 1, 2016 test.

Paragraph:
Upon completion of the annual testing as of May 1, 2015, our previous Phone Hardware reporting unit goodwill was determined to be impaired. Phone Hardware goodwill is included in the Devices reporting unit
within More Personal Computing under our current segment structure. In the second half of fiscal year 2015, Phone Hardware did not meet its sales volume and revenue goals, and the mix of units sold had lower margins than planned. These results,
along with changes in the competitive marketplace and an evaluation of business priorities, led to a shift in strategic direction and reduced future revenue and profitability expectations for the business. As a result of these changes in strategy
and expectations, we forecasted reductions in unit volume growth rates and lower future cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the Phone Hardware reporting unit, which resulted in the determination that an impairment adjustment was required.

Paragraph:
Because our annual test indicated that Phone Hardwares carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value, a second phase of the
goodwill impairment test (Step 2) was performed specific to Phone Hardware. Under Step 2, the fair value of all Phone Hardware assets and liabilities were estimated, including tangible assets, existing technology,

patent agreements, and contractual arrangements, for the purpose of deriving an estimate of the implied fair value of goodwill. The implied fair value of the goodwill was then compared to the
recorded goodwill to determine the amount of the impairment. Assumptions used in measuring the value of these assets and liabilities included the discount rates and royalty rates used in valuing the intangible assets, and consideration of the market
environment in valuing the tangible assets.

Paragraph:
No other instances of impairment were identified in our May 1, 2015 test.

Paragraph:
In the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, we corrected our
intangible assets in the table above for a $585 million misstatement between gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization as of June 30, 2015. We do not consider this correction to be material, and there was no impact to our consolidated
financial statements.

Paragraph:
During fiscal year 2016, we recorded impairment charges of $480 million related to intangible assets in the
Devices reporting unit within our More Personal Computing segment. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we tested these intangible assets for recoverability due to changes in facts and circumstances associated with the shift in strategic
direction and reduced profitability expectations for our phone business. Based on the results of our testing, we determined that the carrying value of the intangible assets was not recoverable, and an impairment charge was recorded to the extent
that estimated fair value exceeded carrying value. We primarily used the income approach to determine the fair value of the intangible assets and determine the amount of impairment.

Paragraph:
During fiscal year 2015, we recorded impairment charges of $2.2 billion related to intangible assets in our previous Phone Hardware reporting unit.
Phone Hardware intangible assets are included in the Devices reporting unit under our current segment structure. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we tested these intangible assets for recoverability due to changes in facts and
circumstances associated with the shift in strategic direction and reduced profitability expectations for Phone Hardware. Based on the results of our testing, we determined that the carrying value of the intangible assets was not recoverable, and an
impairment charge was recorded to the extent that estimated fair value exceeded carrying value. We primarily used a relief from royalty income approach to determine the fair value of the intangible assets and determine the amount of impairment.

Paragraph:
These intangible assets impairment charges were included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses on our consolidated
income statement, and reflected in Corporate and Other in our table of operating income (loss) by segment in Note 21  Segment Information and Geographic Data.

Paragraph:
Item 8

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
The reduction from the federal statutory rate is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in
foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico. Our foreign regional operating centers, which are taxed at rates lower
than the U.S. rate, generated 69%, 73%, and 81% of our foreign income before tax in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. In general, other reconciling items consist of interest, U.S. state income taxes, and credits. In fiscal years 2016,
2015, and 2014, there were no individually significant other reconciling items.

Paragraph:
The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year
2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries, including the net impact of revenue deferrals related to sales of Windows 10, tax benefits from the
adoption of the new accounting guidance relating to stock-based compensation, and distributions from foreign affiliates. The fiscal year 2015 effective tax rate included the tax impact of losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we may not realize
a tax benefit, primarily as a result of impairment and restructuring charges.

Paragraph:
The components of the deferred income tax assets and
liabilities were as follows:

As of
June 30, 2016, we had net operating loss carryforwards of $8.0 billion, including $6.3 billion of foreign net operating loss carryforwards. The valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net operating loss

Paragraph:
Item 8

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered.

Paragraph:
As of June 30, 2016, we have not provided deferred U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences of approximately $124.0 billion resulting from earnings for certain non-U.S.
subsidiaries which are permanently reinvested outside the U.S. The unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences was approximately $39.3 billion as of June 30, 2016.

Paragraph:
Income taxes paid were $3.9 billion, $4.4 billion, and $5.5 billion in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

Paragraph:
Tax contingencies and other income tax liabilities were $11.8 billion and $12.1 billion as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are
included in other long-term liabilities. This decrease relates primarily to tax credits available for carryover and a partial settlement of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009, offset by increases relating to intercompany transfer pricing.

Paragraph:
Uncertain Tax Positions

Paragraph:
Unrecognized tax benefits as of June 30, 2016, 2015, and 2014, were $10.2 billion, $9.6 billion, and $8.7 billion, respectively. If
recognized, these tax benefits would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, by $8.8 billion, $7.9 billion, and $7.0 billion, respectively.

Paragraph:
As of June 30, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we had accrued interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $1.9 billion, $1.7 billion, and $1.5 billion, respectively, net of federal income tax benefits.
Interest expense on unrecognized tax benefits was $163 million, $237 million, and $235 million in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, and was included in provision for income taxes.

Paragraph:
The aggregate changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Balance, beginning of year

Paragraph:
Decreases related to settlements

Paragraph:
Increases for tax positions related to the current year

Paragraph:
Increases for tax positions related to prior years

Paragraph:

Paragraph:
Balance, end of year

Paragraph:
While we settled a portion of our IRS audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year
2011, and settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, we remain under audit for those years. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report for tax years 2004 to 2006
and reopened the audit phase of the examination. As of June 30, 2016, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing, which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. We believe
our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently
available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We also continue to be subject to examination by the IRS for tax years 2010 to 2016.

Paragraph:
We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax
years 1996 to 2016, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 14  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

Paragraph:
Phone Hardware Integration

Paragraph:
In July 2014,
we announced a restructuring plan to simplify our organization and align NDS with our companys overall strategy (the Phone Hardware Integration Plan). Pursuant to the Phone Hardware Integration Plan, we eliminated approximately
19,000 positions in fiscal year 2015, including approximately 13,000 professional and factory positions related to the NDS business. The actions associated with the Phone Hardware Integration Plan were completed as of June 30, 2015.

Paragraph:
In connection with the Phone Hardware Integration Plan, we incurred total restructuring charges of $1.3 billion, including severance expenses and
other reorganization costs, primarily associated with our facilities consolidation and write-downs of certain assets. All restructuring charges incurred under the Phone Hardware Integration Plan were recognized in fiscal year 2015.

Paragraph:
Phone Hardware Restructuring

Paragraph:
In June 2015,
management approved a plan to restructure our phone business to better focus and align resources (the Phone Hardware Restructuring Plan), under which we eliminated approximately 7,400 positions in fiscal year 2016.

Paragraph:
In fiscal year 2015, we incurred restructuring charges of $780 million under the Phone Hardware Restructuring Plan, including severance expenses
and other reorganization costs. In fiscal year 2016, we reversed $21 million of previously estimated restructuring charges related to contract termination costs. The actions associated with the Phone Hardware Restructuring Plan were substantially
complete as of June 30, 2016, and are expected to be completed by the end of calendar year 2016.

Paragraph:
2016 Restructuring

Paragraph:
We periodically evaluate how to best deploy the companys resources. In the fourth quarter of 2016, management approved restructuring plans
that would result in job eliminations, primarily across our smartphone hardware business and global sales. In addition to the elimination of 1,850 positions that were announced in May 2016, approximately 2,850 roles globally will be reduced during
the year as an extension of the earlier plan, and these actions are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2017.

Paragraph:
In
connection with the restructuring plans, we incurred restructuring charges of $501 million in fiscal year 2016, including severance expenses and other reorganization costs. We do not expect to incur additional charges for these restructuring plans
in subsequent years.

Paragraph:
Restructuring charges associated with each of these plans were included in impairment, integration, and
restructuring expenses on our consolidated income statement, and reflected in Corporate and Other in our table of operating income (loss) by segment in Note 21 Segment Information and Geographic Data.

LinkedIn, and we expect the acquisition will close in the 2016 calendar year, subject to approval by LinkedIns shareholders, satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals, and other customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to
accelerate the growth of LinkedIn, as well as Office 365 and Dynamics.

Paragraph:
IPCom patent litigation

Paragraph:
IPCom
GmbH & Co. (IPCom) is a German company that holds a large portfolio of mobile technology-related patents spanning about 170 patent families and addressing a broad range of cellular technologies. IPCom has asserted 19 of these
patents in litigation against Nokia and many of the leading cell phone companies and operators. In November 2014, Microsoft and IPCom entered into a standstill agreement staying all of the pending litigation against Microsoft to permit the parties
to pursue settlement discussions.

Paragraph:
InterDigital patent litigation

Paragraph:
InterDigital Technology Corporation and InterDigital Communications Corporation (collectively, IDT) filed four patent infringement cases against Nokia in the International Trade Commission
(ITC) and in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware between 2007 and 2013. We have been added to these cases as a defendant. IDT has cases pending against other defendants based on the same patents because most of the patents
at issue allegedly relate to 3G and 4G wireless communications standards essential functionality. The cases involving us include three ITC investigations where IDT sought an order excluding importation of 3G and 4G phones into the U.S. and one
active case in U.S. District Court in Delaware seeking an injunction and damages. Each of the ITC matters has been resolved in our favor. In September 2015, in an 
inter partes
 review the United States Patent Trial and Appeal Board issued a
final written decision that deemed unpatentable all asserted claims of the patent remaining at issue in the Delaware case. IDT has appealed this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The Delaware case has been stayed pending
final completion of the 
inter partes
 review (including appeals and any subsequent proceedings in the Patent Office). We filed an antitrust complaint against IDT in the District of Delaware in August 2015 asserting violations of Section 2
of the Sherman Act, alleging the unlawful exploitation of standard essential patents. IDT filed a motion to dismiss, which the District Court denied.

Paragraph:
European copyright levies

Paragraph:
We assumed from
Nokia all potential liability due to Nokias alleged failure to pay private copying levies in various European countries based upon sale of memory cards and mobile phones that incorporate blank memory. The levies are based upon
a 2001 European Union (EU) Directive establishing a right for end users to make copies of copyrighted works for personal or private use, but also allowing the collection of levies based upon sales of blank media or recording devices to
compensate copyright holders for private copying. Various collecting societies in EU countries initiated litigation against Nokia, stating that Nokia must pay levies not only based upon sales of blank memory cards, but also phones that include
blank memory for data storage on the phones, regardless of actual usage of that memory. The most significant cases against Nokia are pending in Germany and Austria, due to both the high volume of sales and high levy amounts sought in these
countries. In December 2015, the industry group BITKOM, of which we are a member, reached a settlement with the German collecting society for all claims from 2008 forward, leaving litigation only for the period 2004-2007 pending in Germany. In
addition, the industry is engaged in settlement negotiations with the Austrian collecting society. We have also settled copyright levies litigation in Spain and France.

In addition to these cases, there were 54 other
patent infringement cases pending against Microsoft as of June 30, 2016.

Paragraph:
Product-Related Litigation

Paragraph:
U.S. cell phone litigation

Paragraph:
Nokia, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 19 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for
the District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. We assumed responsibility for these claims as part of the NDS acquisition and have
been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining 10 cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (FCC Guidelines) are pre-empted by federal law.
The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around
emission guidelines.

Paragraph:
In 2013, defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude plaintiffs expert evidence of general
causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the court granted in part defendants motion to exclude plaintiffs general causation experts. The plaintiffs filed an interlocutory appeal challenging the standard for
evaluating expert scientific evidence, which the District of Columbia Court of Appeals agreed to hear 
en banc
. Trial court proceedings are stayed pending resolution of the appeal.

Paragraph:
Canadian cell phone class action

Paragraph:
Nokia, along with other handset manufacturers and network
operators, is a defendant in a 2013 class action lawsuit filed in the Supreme Court of British Columbia by a purported class of Canadians who have used cellular phones for at least 1,600 hours, including a subclass of users with brain tumors.
Microsoft was served with the complaint in June 2014 and has been substituted for the Nokia defendants. The litigation is not yet active as several defendants remain to be served.

Paragraph:
Other

Paragraph:
We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time
in the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements, these matters are
subject to inherent uncertainties and managements view of these matters may change in the future.

Paragraph:
As of June 30, 2016, we
accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $521 million in other current liabilities. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $1.6 billion in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are
reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.

Revenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. However, due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue

prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. Operating expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to
marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit, and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin.

In
addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that benefit our segments are allocated to them. These allocated costs include costs of: legal, including settlements, and fines; information technology; human
resources; finance; excise taxes; field selling; shared facilities services; and customer service and support. Each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated. Certain

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Paragraph:
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Microsoft Corporation

Paragraph:
Redmond, Washington

Paragraph:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Microsoft
Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders equity for each of the three years in the period
ended June 30, 2016. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

Paragraph:
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

Paragraph:
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2016, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Paragraph:
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016, based on the criteria established in 
Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013)

Paragraph:
REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Paragraph:
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company. Internal control
over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal
control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial
statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of company assets
that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a
misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected.

Paragraph:
Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in 
Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management
concluded that the companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2016. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP has audited our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016; their report is
included in Item 9A.

EPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Paragraph:
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Microsoft Corporation

Paragraph:
Redmond, Washington

Paragraph:
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Microsoft
Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of June 30, 2016, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

Paragraph:
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Paragraph:
A companys internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of
directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Paragraph:
Because of the inherent
limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also,
projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Paragraph:
In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016, based on the criteria established in 
Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Paragraph:
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial
statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2016 of the Company and our report dated July 28, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

under the Microsoft Corporation 1991 Stock Option Plan, as amended (1991 Stock Plan) and (b) any Shares that are represented by awards under the 1991 Stock Plan which, after the Effective Date, are forfeited, expire, are cancelled
without delivery of Shares, or otherwise result in the return of Shares to the Company, minus (c) 100,000,000 Shares (unadjusted for any stock split or stock dividend with respect to the Shares). The Shares may be authorized, but unissued, or
reacquired Common Shares.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Subject to the provisions of the following sentence, if an Award should expire or become unexercisable for any reason
without having been exercised in full, the undelivered Shares which were subject thereto shall, unless the Plan shall have been terminated, become available for future Awards under the Plan. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
any Awards of Options that are transferred to a third party pursuant to a program under which the holder of certain Options may transfer such Options to such third party in exchange for cash or other consideration, shall be removed from the Plan and
the Shares subject to such Awards shall not be available for regrant under the Plan regardless of whether the transferred Options are exercised or expire without exercise.

Paragraph:
4. 
Administration of the Plan
.

Paragraph:
(a) 
Procedure
. The Plan shall be
administered by the Board of Directors of the Company.

Paragraph:
(i) The Board of Directors may appoint one or more Committees each consisting of not less than two members of
the Board of Directors to administer the Plan on behalf of the Board of Directors, subject to such terms and conditions as the Board of Directors may prescribe. Once appointed, such Committees shall continue to serve until otherwise directed by the
Board of Directors.

Paragraph:
(ii) From time to time the Board of Directors may increase the size of the Committee(s) and appoint additional members thereof, remove members
(with or without cause) and appoint new members in substitution therefor, or fill vacancies however caused.

Paragraph:
(iii) The Committee(s) appointed to administer the Plan
on behalf of the Board of Directors may delegate its authority to administer the Plan to the extent provided in the charter for the Committee(s) or a resolution of the Board.

Paragraph:
(b) 
Powers of the Board
. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Board shall have the authority, in its discretion: (i) to grant Incentive Stock Options,
Nonqualified Stock Options, Stock Awards, and SARs; (ii) to determine, in accordance with Section 11(b) of the Plan, the fair market value of the Shares; (iii) to determine, in accordance with Section 11(a) of the Plan, the
exercise price per share of Awards to be granted; (iv) to determine the Participants to whom, and the time or times at which, Awards shall be granted and the number of Shares to be represented by each Award; (v) to interpret the Plan and
the terms of Awards; (vi) to prescribe, amend, and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan; including the form of Award Agreement, and manner of acceptance of an Award, (vii) to determine the terms and provisions of each Award
to be granted (which need not be identical) and, with the consent of the Awardee, modify or amend any Award; (viii) to authorize conversion or substitution under the Plan of any or all Conversion Options; (ix) to accelerate or defer (with
the consent of the Awardee) the vesting or exercise date of any Award; (x) to authorize any person to execute on behalf of the Company any instrument required to effectuate the grant of an Award previously granted by the Board; and (xi) to
make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan; 
provided that,
 no consent of an Awardee is necessary under clauses (vii) or (ix) if the modification, amendment, acceleration, or
deferral, in the reasonable judgment of the Board confers a benefit on the Awardee, or is made pursuant to an adjustment in accordance with Section 14.

Paragraph:
The
Board may, but need not, determine that an award shall vest or be granted subject to the satisfaction of one or more performance goals. Performance goals for awards will be determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board and will be designed
to support the business strategy, and align executives interests with customer and shareholder interests. For awards that are intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m), performance goals will be based on
one or more of the following business criteria: sales or licensing volume, revenues, customer satisfaction, expenses, organizational health/productivity, earnings (which includes similar measurements such as net profits, operating profits and net
income, and which may be calculated before or after taxes, interest, depreciation, amortization or taxes), margins, cash flow, shareholder return, return on equity, return on assets or return on investments, working capital, product shipments or
releases, brand or product recognition or acceptance and/or stock price. These criteria may be measured: individually, alternatively or in any combination; with respect to the Company, a subsidiary, division, business unit, product line, product or
any combination of the foregoing; on an absolute basis, or relative to a target, to a designated comparison group, to results in other periods or to other external measures; and including or excluding items that could affect the measurement, such as
extraordinary or unusual and nonrecurring gains or

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
losses, litigation or claim judgments or settlements, material changes in tax laws, acquisitions or divestitures, the cumulative effect of accounting changes, asset write-downs, restructuring
charges, or the results of discontinued operations.

Paragraph:
(c) 
Effect of Boards Decision
. All decisions, determinations, and interpretations of the Board
shall be final and binding on all Participants and Awardees.

Paragraph:
5. 
Eligibility
.

Paragraph:
(a) Awards may be granted to Participants and to persons to whom offers of employment as an Employee have been extended; provided that Incentive Stock Options may only
be granted to Employees. For avoidance of doubt, directors are not eligible to participate in the Plan unless they are Employees or Consultants.

Paragraph:
(b) The maximum
number of Shares with respect to which an Award or Awards may be granted to any Participant in any one taxable year of the Company (the Maximum Annual Participant Award) shall not exceed 20,000,000 Common Shares for Options or SARs, or
5,000,000 shares for Stock Awards (increased, in both cases proportionately, in the event of any stock split, stock dividend or similar event with respect to the Shares). If an Option is in tandem with an SAR, such that the exercise of the Option or
SAR with respect to a Share cancels the tandem SAR or Option right, respectively, with respect to each Share, the tandem Option and SAR rights with respect to each Share shall be counted as covering but one Share for purposes of the Maximum Annual
Participant Award.

Paragraph:
6. 
Options
.

Paragraph:
(a) Each Option shall be designated in
the written or electronic option agreement as either an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonqualified Stock Option. However, notwithstanding such designations, to the extent that the aggregate fair market value of the Shares with respect to which Options
designated as Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by any Employee during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company) exceeds $100,000, such Options shall be treated as Nonqualified Stock Options.

Paragraph:
(b) For purposes of Section 6(a), Options shall be taken into account in the order in which they were granted, and the fair market value of the Shares shall be
determined as of the time the Option with respect to such Shares is granted.

Paragraph:
(c) Options converted or substituted under the Plan for any or all outstanding stock
options and stock appreciation rights held by employees, consultants, advisors or other option holders granted by entities subsequently acquired by the Company or a subsidiary or affiliate of the Company (Conversion Options) shall be
effective as of the close of the respective mergers into, or acquisitions of such entities by, the Company or a subsidiary or affiliate of the Company; provided that such Conversion Options may not be exercised during any periods that may be
specified by the Company immediately following the close of the merger or acquisition necessary to ensure compliance with applicable law. The Conversion Options may be Incentive Stock Options or Nonqualified Stock Options, as determined by the
Committee; provided, however, that stock appreciation rights in the acquired entity shall only be converted to or substituted with Nonqualified Stock Options. The Conversion Options shall be options to purchase the number of Common Shares determined
by multiplying the number of shares of the acquired entitys common stock underlying each such stock option or stock appreciation right immediately prior to the closing of such merger or acquisition by the number specified in the applicable
merger or acquisition agreement for conversion of each share of such entitys common stock to a Common Share (the Merger Ratio), rounded down to the closest whole share. Such Conversion Options shall be exercisable at an exercise
price per Common Share (increased to the nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price per share of the acquired entitys common stock under each such stock option or stock appreciation right immediately prior to closing divided by the Merger
Ratio. No fractional Common Shares will be issued upon exercise of Conversion Options. In lieu of such issuance, the Common Shares issued pursuant to each such exercise shall be rounded to the closest whole Share. Conversion Options may be granted
and exercised without the issuance of an Award Agreement.

Paragraph:
7. 
Stock Awards
.

Paragraph:
(a) Stock Awards may be granted either alone, in addition to, or in tandem with other Awards granted under the Plan. After the Committee determines that it will offer a
Stock Award, it will advise the Awardee in writing or electronically, by means of an Award Agreement, of the terms, conditions and restrictions,

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
including vesting, if any, related to the offer, including the number of Shares that the Awardee shall be entitled to receive or purchase, the price to be paid, if any, and, if applicable, the
time within which the Awardee must accept the offer. The offer shall be accepted by execution of an Award Agreement in the manner determined by the Committee; provided that Shares may be issued to an Awardee under a fully vested Stock Award without
the issuance of an Award Agreement.

Paragraph:
(b) Unless the Committee determines otherwise, the Award Agreement shall provide for the forfeiture of the non-vested Common
Shares underlying such Stock Award upon the Awardee ceasing to be a Participant. To the extent that the Awardee purchased the Shares granted under such Stock Award and any such Shares remain non-vested at the time the Awardee ceases to be a
Participant, the cessation of Participant status shall cause an immediate sale of such non-vested Shares to the Company at the original price per Common Share paid by the Awardee.

Paragraph:
8. 
SARs
.

Paragraph:
(a) The Committee shall have the full power and authority,
exercisable in its sole discretion, to grant SARs to selected Awardees. The Committee is authorized to grant both tandem stock appreciation rights (Tandem SARs) and stand-alone stock appreciation rights (Stand-Alone SARs) as
described below.

Paragraph:
(b) 
Tandem SARs
.

Paragraph:
(i) Awardees may be granted a Tandem
SAR, exercisable upon such terms and conditions as the Committee shall establish, to elect between the exercise of the underlying Section 6 Option for Common Shares or the surrender of the Option in exchange for a distribution from the Company
in an amount equal to the excess of (A) the fair market value (on the Option surrender date) of the number of Shares in which the Awardee is at the time vested under the surrendered Option (or surrendered portion thereof) over (B) the
aggregate exercise price payable for such vested Shares.

Paragraph:
(ii) No such Option surrender shall be effective unless it is approved by the Committee, either at the time
of the actual Option surrender or at any earlier time. If the surrender is so approved, then the distributions to which the Awardee shall become entitled under this Section 8(b) may be made in Common Shares valued at fair market value on the
Option surrender date, in cash, or partly in Shares and partly in cash, as the Committee shall deem appropriate.

Paragraph:
(iii) If the surrender of an Option is not approved
by the Committee, then the Awardee shall retain whatever rights he or she had under the surrendered Option (or surrendered portion thereof) on the Option surrender date and may exercise such rights at any time prior to the later of (A) five
(5) business days after the receipt of the rejection notice or (B) the last day on which the Option is otherwise exercisable in accordance with the terms of the instrument evidencing such Option, but in no event may such rights be
exercised more than ten (10) years after the date of the Option grant.

Paragraph:
(c) 
Stand-Alone SARs
.

Paragraph:
(i) An Awardee may be granted a Stand-Alone SAR not tied to any underlying Option under Section 6 of the Plan. The Stand-Alone SAR shall cover a specified number of
Common Shares and shall be exercisable upon such terms and conditions as the Committee shall establish. Upon exercise of the Stand-Alone SAR, the holder shall be entitled to receive a distribution from the Company in an amount equal to the excess of
(A) the aggregate fair market value (on the exercise date) of the Common Shares underlying the exercised right over (B) the aggregate base price in effect for those Shares.

Paragraph:
(ii) The number of Common Shares underlying each Stand-Alone SAR and the base price in effect for those Shares shall be determined by the Committee at the time the
Stand-Alone SAR is granted. In no event, however, may the base price per Share be less than the fair market value per underlying Common Share on the grant date.

Paragraph:
(iii) The distribution with respect to an exercised Stand-Alone SAR may be made in Common Shares valued at fair market value on the exercise date, in cash, or partly in
Shares and partly in cash, as the Committee shall deem appropriate.

Paragraph:
(d) The Common Shares underlying any SARs exercised under this Section 8 shall not be
available for subsequent issuance under the Plan.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
9. 
Term of Plan
. The Plan shall become effective as of the Effective Date. It shall continue in effect until
terminated under Section 17 of the Plan.

Paragraph:
10. 
Term of Award; Limitations on Vesting and Repricing.

Paragraph:
(a) The term of each Award shall be no more than ten (10) years from the date of grant. However, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to a Participant
who, at the time the Option is granted, owns Shares representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of shares of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the Option shall be no more than five
(5) years from the date of grant.

Paragraph:
(b) Each Award shall vest over a period of not less than three (3) years from the date of grant, provided that Awards
covering up to 50,000,000 shares (increased, proportionately, in the event of any stock split, stock dividend or similar event) may be granted without regard to the 3-year vesting restriction; provided further, that Conversion Options and awards
that are granted or vest based on performance goals or that vest in less than three (3) years based on death, disability, or retirement shall not count toward the limit of this Section 10(b).

Paragraph:
(c) Without the approval of the shareholders of the Company, no Award may be repriced, replaced, regranted through cancellation, repurchased for cash or other
consideration, or modified (except in connection with an adjustment pursuant to Section 14), in each case if the effect would be to reduce the exercise price for the Shares underlying such Award.

Paragraph:
11. 
Exercise Price and Consideration
.

Paragraph:
(a) The per Share exercise price under
each Award shall be such price as is determined by the Board, subject to the following:

Paragraph:
(i) In the case of an Incentive Stock Option

Paragraph:
(A) granted to an Employee who, at the time of the grant of such Incentive Stock Option, owns shares representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of
all classes of shares of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 110% of the fair market value per Share on the date of grant.

Paragraph:
(B) granted to any other Employee, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 100% of the fair market value per Share on the date of grant.

Paragraph:
(ii) Except for Conversion Options under Section 6(c), the per Share exercise price under a Nonqualified Stock Option or SAR shall be no less than seventy-five
percent (75%) of the fair market value per Share on the date of grant. Notwithstanding the foregoing (or any other provision of the Plan), Options and SARs that are granted to Employees who are non-exempt for purposes of the FLSA, shall satisfy
the requirements for exclusion from regular rate of pay for purposes of the FLSA and shall have an exercise price that is at least eighty-five percent (85%) of the fair market value of the underlying Shares at the time of grant; furthermore,
such Options or SARs shall not be exercisable within the six (6) month period immediately following the date of grant, except, if so provided in the Award Agreement, in the event of the Awardees death, disability, or retirement, upon a
change in corporate control of the Company, or under such other circumstances as are permitted under the FLSA or rules and regulations thereunder.

Paragraph:
(iii) The maximum
aggregate number of Shares underlying all Nonqualified Stock Options and SARs with a per Share exercise price of less than fair market value on any grant date that may be granted under this Plan is 50,000,000 Shares (increased, proportionately, in
the event of any stock split, or stock dividend or similar event with respect to the Shares); provided that Conversion Options shall not count against the limit of this Section 11(a)(iii).

Paragraph:
(b) The fair market value per Share shall be the closing price per share of the Common Share on the Nasdaq Stock Market (Nasdaq) on the date of grant. If the
Shares cease to be listed on Nasdaq, the Board shall designate an alternative method of determining the fair market value of the Shares.

Paragraph:
(c) The consideration to be
paid for the Shares to be issued upon exercise of an Award, including the method of payment, shall be determined by the Board at the time of grant and may consist of cash and/or check. Payment may also be made by delivering a properly executed
exercise notice together with irrevocable instructions to a broker to promptly deliver to the Company the amount of sale proceeds

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
necessary to pay the exercise price. If the Awardee is an officer of the Company within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, the officer may, in addition, be allowed to pay all or
part of the purchase price with Shares which, as of the exercise date, the officer has owned for six (6) months or more. If the Awardee is a participant in the 1998 Microsoft Corporation Stock Option Gain And Bonus Deferral Program, he may in
addition be allowed to pay all or part of the purchase price of any deferred Option with Shares. Shares used by officers to pay the exercise price shall be valued at their fair market value on the exercise date.

Paragraph:
(d) Prior to issuance of the Shares upon exercise of an Award, the Awardee shall pay any federal, state, and local income and employment tax withholding obligations
applicable to such Award. If an Awardee is an officer of the Company within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, he may elect to pay such withholding tax obligations by having the Company withhold Shares having a value equal to the
amount required to be withheld, and any Award under the Plan may permit or require that such withholding tax obligations be paid by having the Company withhold Shares having a value equal to the amount required to be withheld. The value of the
Shares to be withheld shall equal the fair market value of the Shares on the day the Award is exercised. The right of an officer to dispose of Shares to the Company in satisfaction of withholding tax obligations shall be deemed to be approved as
part of the initial grant of an Award, unless thereafter rescinded, and shall otherwise be made in compliance with Rule 16b-3 and other applicable regulations, and any Award under the Plan may permit or require that such withholding tax obligations
be paid by having the Company withhold Shares having a value equal to the amount required to be withheld.

Paragraph:
12. 
Exercise of Award
.

Paragraph:
(a) 
Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Shareholder
. Any Award granted hereunder shall be exercisable at such times and under such conditions as determined by the
Board at the time of grant, and as shall be permissible under the terms of the Plan.

Paragraph:
An Award may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share.

Paragraph:
An Award shall be deemed to be exercised when written or electronic notice of such exercise has been given to the Company in accordance with the terms of the Award by
the person entitled to exercise the Award and full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Award is exercised has been received by the Company. Full payment may, as authorized by the Board, consist of any consideration and method of payment
allowable under Section 11(c) of the Plan. Until the issuance (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company) of the share certificate evidencing such Shares, no right to
vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a shareholder shall exist with respect to the Shares subject to the Award, notwithstanding the exercise of the Award. The Company shall issue (or cause to be issued) such share certificate promptly
upon exercise of the Award. In the event that the exercise of an Award is treated in part as the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option and in part as the exercise of a Nonqualified Stock Option pursuant to Section 6(a), the Company shall issue
a share certificate evidencing the Shares treated as acquired upon the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option and a separate share certificate evidencing the Shares treated as acquired upon the exercise of a Nonqualified Stock Option, and shall
identify each such certificate accordingly in its share transfer records. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the share certificate is issued, except as provided in Section 14
of the Plan.

Paragraph:
Exercise of an Award in any manner and delivery of the Shares subject to such Award shall result in a decrease in the number of Shares which thereafter
may be available, both for purposes of the Plan and for sale under the Award, by the number of Shares as to which the Award is exercised.

Paragraph:
(b) 
Termination of
Status as a Participant
. In the event of termination of an Awardees Continuous Status as a Participant, such Awardee may exercise his or her rights under any outstanding Awards to the extent exercisable on the date of termination (but in
no event later than the date of expiration of the term of such Award as set forth in the Award Agreement). To the extent that the Awardee was not entitled to exercise his or her rights under such Awards at the date of such termination, or does not
exercise such rights within the time specified in the individual Award Agreements, the Awards shall terminate, except as otherwise may be provided in the Award Agreement.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
(c) 
Disability of Awardee
. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 12(b) above, in the event of termination
of an Awardees Continuous Status as a Participant as a result of total and permanent disability (i.e., by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be
expected to last for a continuous period of twelve (12) months) (i) the Awardee is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity, or (ii) the Awardee has received income replacement benefits for at least three months under an
accident and health plan covering Company employees):

Paragraph:
(i) Any outstanding but unvested Stock Award shall become immediately vested (unless otherwise provided in the
Award Agreement); and

Paragraph:
(ii) Any outstanding Option or SAR shall vest, but only to the extent of the vesting that would have occurred had the Awardee remained in
Continuous Status as a Participant for a period of twelve (12) months after the date on which the Participant ceased performing services as a result of the total and permanent disability. An Option or SAR that is vested pursuant to this
Section 12(c) must be exercised within eighteen (18) months (or such shorter time as is specified in the grant) from the date on which the Participant ceased performing services as a result of the total and permanent disability (but in no
event later than the date of expiration of the term of such Option or SAR as set forth in the Award Agreement). To the extent that the Awardee was not entitled to exercise such Option or SAR within the time specified herein, the Award shall
terminate. This Section 12(c) shall only apply to a Conversion Option to the extent provided in the Award Agreement for the Conversion Option.

Paragraph:
(d) 
Death of
Awardee
. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 12(b) above, in the event of the death of an Awardee:

Paragraph:
(i) who is at the time of death a Participant with
an outstanding Stock Award, all unvested shares under any outstanding Awards shall become immediately vested (unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement). Such shares may be claimed by the Awardees estate or by a person who acquired the
right to the shares by bequest or inheritance within twelve (12) months following the date of death. Any right to shares not claimed within twelve (12) months from the date of death shall be canceled.

Paragraph:
(ii) who is at the time of death a Participant with an outstanding Option or SAR, the Option or SAR will vest, but only to the extent of the vesting that would have
occurred had the Awardee continued living and remained in Continuous Status as a Participant twelve (12) months following the date of death. An Option or SAR that is vested pursuant to this Section 12(d)(i) may be exercised, at any time
within twelve (12) months following the date of death, by the Awardees estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Award by bequest or inheritance; or

Paragraph:
(iii) whose Option or SAR has not yet expired but whose Continuous Status as a Participant terminated prior to the date of death, the Option or SAR may be exercised, at
any time within twelve (12) months following the date of death, by the Awardees estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option or SAR by bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent of the right to exercise that had
vested at the date of termination.

Paragraph:
This Section 12(d) shall only apply to a Conversion Option to the extent provided in the Award Agreement for the Conversion
Option.

Paragraph:
(e) Notwithstanding subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this Section 12, the Board shall have the authority to extend the expiration date of any
outstanding Option in circumstances in which it deems such action to be appropriate (provided that no such extension shall extend the term of an Award beyond the date on which the Award would have expired if no termination of the Employees
Continuous Status as a Participant had occurred).

Paragraph:
13. 
Non-Transferability of Awards
. An Award may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred,
or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the Awardee, only by the Awardee; provided that the Board may permit further transferability, on a general or
specific basis, and may impose conditions and limitations on any permitted transferability.

Paragraph:
14. 
Adjustments to Shares Subject to the Plan
. If any change is
made to the Shares by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination of shares, exchange of shares or other change affecting the outstanding Shares as a class without the Companys receipt of consideration, appropriate

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
adjustments shall be made to (i) the maximum number and/or class of securities issuable under the Plan, (ii) the number and/or class of securities and/or the price per Share covered by
outstanding Awards under the Plan, (iii) the Maximum Annual Participant Award, (iv) the maximum aggregate number of Shares underlying all Nonqualified Stock Options and SARs with a per Share exercise price of less than fair market value on
any grant date that may be granted under the Plan, and (v) the maximum aggregate number of Shares underlying all Awards with a vesting period of less than three years. The Board may also make adjustments described in (i)-(v) of the
previous sentence in the event of any distribution of assets to shareholders other than a normal cash dividend. In determining adjustments to be made under this Section 14, the Board may take into account such factors as it deems appropriate,
including (i) the restrictions of applicable law, (ii) the potential tax consequences of an adjustment and (iii) the possibility that some Awardees might receive an adjustment and a distribution or other unintended benefit, and in
light of such factors or circumstances may make adjustments that are not uniform or proportionate among outstanding Awards, modify vesting dates, defer the delivery of stock certificates or make other equitable adjustments. Any such adjustments to
outstanding Awards will be effected in a manner that precludes the enlargement of rights and benefits under such Awards. Adjustments, if any, and any determinations or interpretations, including any determination of whether a distribution is other
than a normal cash dividend, made by the Board shall be final, binding and conclusive. For purposes of this Section 14, conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been effected without receipt of
consideration. Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of shares of any class, or securities convertible into shares of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or
price of Shares subject to an Award.

Paragraph:
In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Award will terminate immediately prior to the
consummation of such proposed action, unless otherwise provided by the Board. The Board may, in the exercise of its sole discretion in such instances, declare that any Award shall terminate as of a date fixed by the Board and give each Awardee the
right to exercise an Award as to all or any part of the Shares subject to an Award, including Shares as to which the Award would not otherwise be exercisable. In the event of a proposed sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company,
or the merger of the Company with or into another corporation, each Award shall be assumed or an equivalent award shall be substituted by such successor corporation or a parent or subsidiary of such successor corporation, unless such successor
corporation does not agree to assume the Award or to substitute an equivalent award, in which case the Board shall, in lieu of such assumption or substitution, provide for the Awardee to have the right to exercise the Award as to all of the Shares
subject to Awards, including Shares as to which the Award would not otherwise be exercisable. If the Board makes an Award fully exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a merger or sale of assets, the Board shall notify the
Awardee that the Award shall be fully exercisable for a period of fifteen (15) days from the date of such notice, and the Award will terminate upon the expiration of such period.

Paragraph:
15. 
Time of Granting Awards
. The date of grant of an Award shall, for all purposes, be the date on which the Company completes the corporate action relating to
the grant of such Award and all conditions to the grant have been satisfied, provided that conditions to the grant, exercise or vesting of an Award shall not defer the date of grant. Notice of a grant shall be given to each Participant to whom an
Award is so granted within a reasonable time after the determination has been made.

Paragraph:
16. 
Substitutions and Assumptions
. The Board shall have the right to
substitute or assume Awards in connection with mergers, reorganizations, separations, or other transactions to which Section 424(a) of the Code applies, provided such substitutions and assumptions are permitted by Section 424 of the Code
and the regulations promulgated thereunder. The number of Shares reserved pursuant to Section 3 may be increased by the corresponding number of Awards assumed and, in the case of a substitution, by the net increase in the number of Shares
subject to Awards before and after the substitution.

Paragraph:
17. 
Amendment and Termination of the Plan
.

Paragraph:
(a) 
Amendment and Termination
. The Board may amend or terminate the Plan from time to time in such respects as the Board may deem advisable (including, but not
limited to amendments which the Board deems appropriate to enhance the Companys ability to claim deductions related to stock option exercises); provided that any increase in the number of Shares subject to the Plan, other than in connection
with an adjustment under Section 14 of the Plan, and any amendment described in Section 10(c) of the Plan, shall require approval of or ratification by the shareholders of the Company.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
(b) 
Participants in Foreign Countries
. The Board shall have the authority to adopt such modifications, procedures,
and subplans as may be necessary or desirable to comply with provisions of the laws of foreign countries in which the Company or its Subsidiaries may operate to assure the viability of the benefits from Awards granted to Participants performing
services in such countries and to meet the objectives of the Plan.

Paragraph:
(c) 
Effect of Amendment or Termination
. Except as otherwise provided in Sections 4 and 14,
any such amendment or termination of the Plan shall not affect Awards already granted and such Awards shall remain in full force and effect as if this Plan had not been amended or terminated, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Awardee and
the Board, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Awardee and the Company.

Paragraph:
18.

Cash equivalents, excluding items classified as marketable securities, include short-term, highly liquid Investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and so near their maturity that they present minimal risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Generally, only investments with original maturities of three months or less qualify under that definition. Original maturity means original maturity to the entity holding the investment. For example, both a three-month US Treasury bill and a three-year Treasury note purchased three months from maturity qualify as cash equivalents. However, a Treasury note purchased three years ago does not become a cash equivalent when its remaining maturity is three months. Short-term investments, exclusive of cash equivalents, generally consist of marketable securities intended to be sold within one year (or the normal operating cycle if longer) and may include trading securities, available-for-sale securities, or held-to-maturity securities (if maturing within one year), as applicable.

NOTE 1
 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Paragraph:
Accounting
 Principles

Paragraph:
The
 consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are
 prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
 accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.
 GAAP”).

Paragraph:
We have
 recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current
 period presentation, with no impact on consolidated net income or
 cash flows.

Paragraph:
Principles of
 Consolidation

Paragraph:
The
 consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft
 Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and
 balances have been eliminated. Equity investments through which we
 are able to exercise significant influence over but do not control
 the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the
 investee’s activities are accounted for using the equity
 method. Investments through which we are not able to exercise
 significant influence over the investee and which do not have
 readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost
 method.

Paragraph:
Segment
 Information

Paragraph:
In June
 2015, we announced a change in organizational structure to align to
 our strategic direction as a productivity and platform company.
 During the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, our chief operating
 decision maker, who is also our Chief Executive Officer, requested
 changes in the information that he regularly reviews for purposes
 of allocating resources and assessing performance. As a result,
 beginning in fiscal year 2016, we report our financial performance
 based on our new segments described in Note 21 – Segment
 Information and Geographic Data. We have recast certain prior
 period amounts to conform to the way we internally manage and
 monitor segment performance during fiscal year 2016. This change
 primarily impacted Note 10 – Goodwill, Note 15 –
 Unearned Revenue, and Note 21 – Segment Information and
 Geographic Data, with no impact on consolidated net income or cash
 flows.

Paragraph:
Estimates and
 Assumptions

Paragraph:
Preparing
 financial statements requires management to make estimates and
 assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
 liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates include:
 loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of, and/or
 potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, for our
 reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible
 and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; allowances
 for product returns; the market value of and volume of demand for
 our inventory; and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates.
 Examples of assumptions include: the elements comprising a software
 arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades or
 enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is
 achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax
 consequences of events that have been recognized on our
 consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining
 when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. Actual
 results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates
 and assumptions.

Paragraph:
Foreign
 Currencies

Paragraph:
Assets
 and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at
 the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses
 are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the
 year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are
 recorded to other comprehensive income
 (“OCI”).

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Product Revenue and
 Service and Other Revenue

Paragraph:
Service
 revenue exceeded 10% of total revenue for the first time in fiscal
 year 2016. As a result, we have separately disclosed product
 revenue and service and other revenue on our consolidated income
 statements.

Paragraph:
Product
 revenue includes sales from operating systems; cross-device
 productivity applications; server applications; business solution
 applications; desktop and server management tools; software
 development tools; video games; hardware such as PCs, tablets,
 gaming and entertainment consoles, phones, other intelligent
 devices, and related accessories; and training and certification of
 computer system integrators and developers.

Paragraph:
Service
 and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that
 provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content
 such as Office 365, Microsoft Azure (“Azure”),
 Microsoft Dynamics (“Dynamics”) CRM Online, and Xbox
 Live; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other
 revenue also includes sales from online advertising.

Paragraph:
Revenue
 Recognition

Paragraph:
Revenue
 is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
 delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and
 collectability is probable. Revenue generally is recognized net of
 allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers and
 subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.

Paragraph:
Revenue
 recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to
 determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be
 accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair
 value for each of the elements.

Paragraph:
Microsoft
 enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of
 software, services, and hardware. Where elements are delivered over
 different periods of time, and when allowed under U.S. GAAP,
 revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their
 relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement, and
 revenue is recognized as each element is delivered. We use a
 hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating
 revenue to elements: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of
 fair value (“VSOE”), (ii) third-party evidence,
 and (iii) best estimate of selling price (“ESP”).
 For software elements, we follow the industry specific software
 guidance which only allows for the use of VSOE in establishing fair
 value. Generally, VSOE is the price charged when the deliverable is
 sold separately or the price established by management for a
 product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will
 not change before introduction into the marketplace. ESPs are
 established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be
 if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. Our
 process for determining ESPs requires judgment and considers
 multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique
 facts and circumstances related to each deliverable.

Paragraph:
Revenue
 for retail packaged products, products licensed to original
 equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), and perpetual
 licenses under certain volume licensing programs generally is
 recognized as products are shipped or made available.

Paragraph:
Technology guarantee programs are accounted for as
 multiple-element arrangements as customers receive free or
 significantly discounted rights to use upcoming new versions of a
 software product if they license existing versions of the product
 during the eligibility period. Revenue is allocated between the
 existing product and the new product, and revenue allocated to the
 new product is deferred until that version is delivered. The
 revenue allocation is based on the VSOE of fair value of the
 products. The VSOE of fair value for upcoming new products are
 based on the price determined by management having the relevant
 authority when the element is not yet sold separately, but is
 expected to be sold in the near future at the price set by
 management.

Paragraph:
Software
 updates that will be provided free of charge are evaluated on a
 case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of
 an upgrade and create a multiple-element arrangement, which may
 require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is
 delivered, or if it is determined that implied post-contract
 customer support (“PCS”) is being provided, the
 arrangement is accounted for as a multiple-element arrangement and
 all revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over
 the implied PCS term when the VSOE of fair value does not exist. If
 updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade,
 revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made
 available.

Paragraph:
Customers
 purchasing a Windows 10 license will receive unspecified updates
 and upgrades over the life of their Windows 10 device at no
 additional cost. As these updates and upgrades will not be sold on
 a stand-alone basis, we are unable to establish VSOE of fair value.
 Accordingly, revenue from licenses of Windows 10 is recognized
 ratably over the estimated life of the related device, which ranges
 between two to four years.

Paragraph:
Certain
 volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for
 current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future
 versions of software products, which we have determined are
 additional software products and are therefore accounted for as
 subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and
 recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period.
 Arrangements that include term-based licenses for current products
 with the right to use unspecified future versions of the software
 during the coverage period, are also accounted for as
 subscriptions, with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage
 period. Revenue from cloud-based services arrangements that allow
 for the use of a hosted software product or service over a
 contractually determined period of time without taking possession
 of software are accounted for as subscriptions with billings
 recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over
 the coverage period beginning on the date the service is made
 available to customers. Revenue from cloud-based services
 arrangements that are provided on a consumption basis (for example,
 the amount of storage used in a particular period) is recognized
 commensurate with the customer utilization of such
 resources.

Paragraph:
Some
 volume licensing arrangements include time-based subscriptions for
 cloud-based services and software offerings that are accounted for
 as subscriptions. These arrangements are considered
 multiple-element arrangements. However, because all elements are
 accounted for as subscriptions and have the same coverage period
 and delivery pattern, they have the same revenue recognition
 timing.

Paragraph:
Revenue
 related to Microsoft Surface (“Surface”) devices, Xbox
 consoles, games published by us, phones, and other hardware
 components is generally recognized when ownership is transferred to
 the resellers or to end customers when selling directly through
 Microsoft retail stores and online marketplaces. A portion of
 revenue may be deferred when these products are combined with
 software elements, and/or services. Revenue related to licensing
 for games published by third parties for use on the Xbox consoles
 is recognized when games are manufactured by the game
 publishers.

Paragraph:
Display
 advertising revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed.
 Search advertising revenue is recognized when the ad appears in the
 search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has
 been completed. Consulting services revenue is recognized as
 services are rendered, generally based on the negotiated hourly
 rate in the consulting arrangement and the number of hours worked
 during the period. Consulting revenue for fixed-price services
 arrangements is recognized as services are provided.

Paragraph:
Cost of
 Revenue

Paragraph:
Cost of
 revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products
 sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product
 support service centers and product distribution centers; costs
 incurred to include software on PCs sold by OEMs, to drive traffic
 to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs
 incurred to support and maintain Internet-based products and
 services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs;
 inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery
 of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized
 software development costs. Capitalized software development costs
 are amortized over the estimated lives of the products.

Paragraph:
Product
 Warranty

Paragraph:
We
 provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under
 hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is
 recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on
 historical and projected product failure rates, historical and
 projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures
 (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary
 depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do
 business, but generally include parts and labor over a period
 generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software
 warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as
 security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We
 regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the
 recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as
 necessary.

Paragraph:
Research and
 Development

Paragraph:
Research
 and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits,
 stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related
 expenses associated with product development. Research and
 development expenses also include third-party development and
 programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate
 software for international markets, and the amortization of
 purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to
 software development are included in research and development
 expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached,
 which for our software products, is generally shortly before the
 products are released to manufacturing. Once technological
 feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to
 cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the
 products.

Paragraph:
Sales and
 Marketing

Paragraph:
Sales and
 marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based
 compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses
 associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of
 advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs.
 Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was
 $1.6 billion, $1.9 billion, and $2.3 billion in fiscal years 2016,
 2015, and 2014, respectively.

Paragraph:
Stock-Based
 Compensation

Paragraph:
Compensation cost for stock awards is measured at the fair
 value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated
 forfeitures, over the related service period using the
 straight-line method. The fair value of stock awards is based on
 the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the
 present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting
 period. Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan
 (“ESPP”) is measured as the discount the employee is
 entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of
 purchase.

Paragraph:
Income
 Taxes

Paragraph:
Income
 tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, the
 provision for U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of international
 subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently reinvested, and interest
 and penalties on uncertain tax positions. Certain income and
 expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements
 in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is
 reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported
 net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a
 tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income taxes are
 classified as long-term on our consolidated balance
 sheets.

Paragraph:
Fair Value
 Measurements

Paragraph:
We
 account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The
 hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the
 extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable
 in the market. We categorize each of our fair value
 measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level
 input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its
 entirety. These levels are:

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Level 1
 – inputs are based upon
 unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active
 markets. Our Level 1 non-derivative investments primarily include
 U.S. government securities, domestic and international equities,
 and actively traded mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative
 assets and liabilities include those actively traded on
 exchanges.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Level 2
 – inputs are based upon
 quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted
 prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not
 active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the
 Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are
 observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable
 market data for substantially the full term of the assets or
 liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash
 flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using
 market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves,
 credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices
 for currencies and commodities. Our Level 2 non-derivative
 investments consist primarily of corporate notes and bonds, common
 and preferred stock, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, U.S.
 government and agency securities, and foreign government bonds. Our
 Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities primarily include certain
 over-the-counter option and swap contracts.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Level 3
 – inputs are generally
 unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of
 assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset
 or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using
 model-based techniques, including option pricing models and
 discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 non-derivative assets
 primarily comprise investments in common and preferred stock, and
 goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair
 value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used in
 the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and
 liabilities.

Paragraph:
We
 measure certain assets, including our cost and equity method
 investments, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are
 deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. The fair values of
 these investments are determined based on valuation techniques
 using the best information available, and may include quoted market
 prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections.
 An impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment
 exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be
 other-than-temporary.

Paragraph:
Our other
 current financial assets and our current financial liabilities have
 fair values that approximate their carrying values.

Paragraph:
Financial
 Instruments

Paragraph:
Investments

Paragraph:
We
 consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a
 maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash
 equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their
 carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities
 of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than
 one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with
 maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on
 their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities
 represent the investment of cash that is available for current
 operations. All cash equivalents and short-term investments are
 classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are
 recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in
 market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are
 reflected in OCI.

Paragraph:
Equity
 and other investments classified as long-term include both debt and
 equity instruments. Debt and publicly-traded equity securities are
 classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are
 recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in the
 market value of available-for-sale securities, excluding
 other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in OCI. Common and
 preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more
 than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost or
 using the equity method.

Paragraph:
We lend
 certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment
 returns. These transactions are accounted for as secured borrowings
 and the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on
 our consolidated balance sheets. Cash and/or security interests are
 received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount
 determined based upon the underlying security lent and the
 creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is recorded as an
 asset with a corresponding liability.

Paragraph:
Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in
 fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. Fair value is
 calculated based on publicly available market information or other
 estimates determined by management. We employ a systematic
 methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available
 quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential
 impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds
 its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market
 conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration
 and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for
 equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to
 sell, the investment. For fixed-income securities, we also evaluate
 whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely
 than not that we will be required to sell the security before
 recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to
 the financial health of and business outlook for the investee,
 including industry and sector performance, changes in technology,
 and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in
 fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment
 charge is recorded to other income (expense), net and a new cost
 basis in the investment is established.

Paragraph:
Derivatives

Paragraph:
Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or
 liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for
 changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended
 use of the derivative and the resulting designation.

Paragraph:
For
 derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains
 (losses) are recognized in earnings in the periods of change
 together with the offsetting losses (gains) on the hedged items
 attributed to the risk being hedged. For options designated as fair
 value hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the
 assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in
 earnings.

Paragraph:
For
 derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the
 effective portion of the gains (losses) on the derivatives is
 initially reported as a component of OCI and is subsequently
 recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in
 earnings. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in
 the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge
 effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. Gains (losses) on
 derivatives representing either hedge components excluded from the
 assessment of effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized
 in earnings.

Paragraph:
For
 derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains
 (losses) from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in
 other income (expense), net. Other than those derivatives entered
 into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the
 gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized
 gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities,
 which are recorded as a component of OCI until the securities are
 sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts
 are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income
 (“AOCI”) into other income (expense), net.

Paragraph:
Allowance for Doubtful
 Accounts

Paragraph:
The
 allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of
 probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We
 determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts,
 historical experience, and other currently available evidence.
 Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as
 follows:

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Balance, beginning of
 period

Paragraph:
Charged to costs and other

Paragraph:
Write-offs

Paragraph:
Balance, end of period

Paragraph:
Inventories

Paragraph:
Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of
 cost or market. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing
 overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. We
 regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase
 commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our
 inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below
 carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through
 a charge to cost of revenue.

Paragraph:
Property and
 Equipment

Paragraph:
Property
 and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and
 depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the
 estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated
 useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as
 follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use,
 three to seven years; computer equipment, two to three years;
 buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold
 improvements, three to 20 years; and furniture and equipment, one
 to 10 years. Land is not depreciated.

Paragraph:
Goodwill

Paragraph:
Goodwill
 is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating
 segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis
 (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or
 circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the
 fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.

Paragraph:
Intangible
 Assets

Paragraph:
All of
 our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized
 using the straight-line method over their estimated period of
 benefit, ranging from one to 15 years. We evaluate the
 recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into
 account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates
 of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be
 impaired.

Paragraph:
Recent Accounting
 Guidance

Paragraph:
Recently adopted
 accounting guidance

Paragraph:
Improvements to
 Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting

Paragraph:
In March
 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
 issued a new standard that changes the accounting for certain
 aspects of share-based payments to employees. The new guidance
 requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded in
 the income statement when stock awards vest or are settled. In
 addition, cash flows related to excess tax benefits will no longer
 be separately classified as a financing activity apart from other
 income tax cash flows. The standard also allows us to repurchase
 more of an employee’s vesting shares for tax withholding
 purposes without triggering liability accounting, clarifies that
 all cash payments made to tax authorities on an employee’s
 behalf for withheld shares should be presented as a financing
 activity on our cash flows statement, and provides an accounting
 policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. The new
 standard is effective for us beginning July 1, 2017, with
 early adoption permitted.

Paragraph:
We
 elected to early adopt the new guidance in the third quarter of
 fiscal year 2016 which requires us to reflect any adjustments as of
 July 1, 2015, the beginning of the annual period that includes
 the interim period of adoption. The primary impact of adoption was
 the recognition of excess tax benefits in our provision for income
 taxes rather than paid-in capital for all periods in fiscal year
 2016. Additional amendments to the accounting for income taxes
 and minimum statutory withholding tax requirements had no impact to
 retained earnings as of July 1, 2015, where the cumulative
 effect of these changes are required to be recorded. We have
 elected to continue to estimate forfeitures expected to occur to
 determine the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each
 period.

Paragraph:
We
 elected to apply the presentation requirements for cash flows
 related to excess tax benefits retrospectively to all periods
 presented which resulted in an increase to both net cash from
 operations and net cash used in financing of $588 million and $271
 million for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014,
 respectively. The presentation requirements for cash flows related
 to employee taxes paid for withheld shares had no impact to any of
 the periods presented on our consolidated cash flows statements
 since such cash flows have historically been presented as a
 financing activity.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Adoption
 of the new standard resulted in the recognition of excess tax
 benefits in our provision for income taxes rather than paid-in
 capital of $402 million for the year ended June 30,
 2016.

Paragraph:
Balance Sheet
 Classification of Deferred Taxes

Paragraph:
In
 November 2015, the FASB issued guidance that requires companies to
 classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on
 the balance sheet rather than separately disclosing deferred taxes
 as current and noncurrent. This standard is effective for us
 beginning July 1, 2017, and can be early adopted and applied
 either prospectively or retrospectively to all periods presented
 upon adoption.

Paragraph:
We
 elected to early adopt the new guidance in the fourth quarter of
 fiscal year 2016 on a retrospective basis. While the guidance
 changes the manner in which deferred taxes are classified on the
 balance sheet, we are still required to offset deferred tax assets
 and liabilities for each taxpaying component within a tax
 jurisdiction. Adoption of the new standard impacted our previously
 reported results as follows:

Paragraph:

Paragraph:
Financial Instruments
 – Credit Losses

Paragraph:
In June
 2016, the FASB issued a new standard to replace the incurred loss
 impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that
 reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a
 broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform
 credit loss estimates. For trade and other receivables, loans, and
 other financial instruments, we will be required to use a
 forward-looking expected loss model rather than the incurred loss
 model for recognizing credit losses which reflects losses that are
 probable. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt
 securities will also be recorded through an allowance for credit
 losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of
 the securities. The new standard will be effective for us beginning
 July 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted beginning
 July 1, 2019. Application of the amendments is through a
 cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the
 effective date. We are currently evaluating the impact of this
 standard on our consolidated financial statements.

Paragraph:
Leases

Paragraph:
In
 February 2016, the FASB issued a new standard related to leases to
 increase transparency and comparability among organizations by
 requiring the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on
 the balance sheet. Most prominent among the amendments is the
 recognition of assets and liabilities by lessees for those leases
 classified as operating leases under previous U.S. GAAP. Under the
 new standard, disclosures are required to meet the objective of
 enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount,
 timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. We will
 be required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the
 earliest period presented using a modified retrospective
 approach.

Paragraph:
The new
 standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2019, with
 early adoption permitted. We currently anticipate early adoption of
 the new standard effective July 1, 2017 in conjunction with
 our adoption of the new revenue standard. Our ability to early
 adopt is dependent on system readiness, including software procured
 from third-party providers, and the completion of our analysis of
 information necessary to restate prior period financial
 statements.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
We
 anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our
 consolidated financial statements. While we are continuing to
 assess all potential impacts of the standard, we currently believe
 the most significant impact relates to our accounting for office,
 retail, and datacenter operating leases.

Paragraph:
Financial Instruments
 – Recognition, Measurement, Presentation, and
 Disclosure

Paragraph:
In
 January 2016, the FASB issued a new standard to amend certain
 aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure
 of financial instruments. Most prominent among the amendments is
 the requirement for changes in the fair value of our equity
 investments, with certain exceptions, to be recognized through net
 income rather than OCI. The new standard will be effective for us
 beginning July 1, 2018. The application of the amendments will
 result in a cumulative-effect adjustment to our consolidated
 balance sheets as of the effective date. We are currently
 evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated
 financial statements.

Paragraph:
Revenue from Contracts
 with Customers

Paragraph:
In May
 2014, the FASB issued a new standard related to revenue
 recognition. Under the new standard, revenue is recognized when a
 customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is
 recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the
 entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
 In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature,
 amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising
 from contracts with customers. The FASB has recently issued several
 amendments to the standard, including clarification on accounting
 for licenses of intellectual property and identifying performance
 obligations.

Paragraph:
The
 guidance permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each
 prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or
 retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying
 the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the
 cumulative catch-up transition method). We currently anticipate
 adopting the standard using the full retrospective method to
 restate each prior reporting period presented.

Paragraph:
The new
 standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2018, and
 adoption as of the original effective date of July 1, 2017 is
 permitted. We currently anticipate early adoption of the new
 standard effective July 1, 2017. Our ability to early adopt
 using the full retrospective method is dependent on system
 readiness, including software procured from third-party providers,
 and the completion of our analysis of information necessary to
 restate prior period financial statements.

Paragraph:
We
 anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our
 consolidated financial statements. While we are continuing to
 assess all potential impacts of the standard, we currently believe
 the most significant impact relates to our accounting for software
 license revenue. We expect revenue related to hardware, cloud
 offerings, and professional services to remain substantially
 unchanged. Specifically, under the new standard we expect to
 recognize Windows 10 revenue predominantly at the time of billing
 rather than ratably over the life of the related device. We also
 expect to recognize license revenue at the time of billing rather
 than over the subscription period from certain multi-year
 commercial software subscriptions that include both software
 licenses and Software Assurance. Due to the complexity of certain
 of our commercial license subscription contracts, the actual
 revenue recognition treatment required under the standard will be
 dependent on contract-specific terms, and may vary in some
 instances from recognition at the time of billing.

Paragraph:
We
 currently believe that the net change in Windows 10 revenue from
 period to period is indicative of the net change in revenue we
 expect from the adoption of the new standard.

Paragraph:
The entire disclosure for all significant accounting policies of the reporting entity.

NOTE 5 —
 DERIVATIVES

Paragraph:
We use derivative
 instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity
 prices, interest rates, and credit; to enhance investment returns;
 and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Our objectives for
 holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently
 managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as
 possible.

Paragraph:
Our derivative programs
 include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge
 accounting treatment. All notional amounts presented below are
 measured in U.S. dollar equivalents.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Foreign Currency

Paragraph:
Certain forecasted
 transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign
 currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to
 maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge
 positions. Option and forward contracts are used to hedge a portion
 of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the
 future and are designated as cash flow hedging instruments.
 Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British
 pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar. As of June 30,
 2016 and June 30, 2015, the total notional amounts of these
 foreign exchange contracts sold were $8.4 billion and $9.8 billion,
 respectively.

Paragraph:
Foreign currency risks
 related to certain non-U.S. dollar denominated securities are
 hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated
 as fair value hedging instruments. As of June 30, 2016 and
 June 30, 2015, the total notional amounts of these foreign
 exchange contracts sold were $5.3 billion for both
 periods.

Paragraph:
Certain options and
 forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to
 manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on certain balance
 sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency
 exposures. As of June 30, 2016, the total notional
 amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were
 $12.0 billion and $11.7 billion, respectively. As of June 30,
 2015, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange
 contracts purchased and sold were $9.7 billion and $11.0 billion,
 respectively.

Paragraph:
Equity

Paragraph:
Securities held in our
 equity and other investments portfolio are subject to market price
 risk. Market price risk is managed relative to broad-based
 global and domestic equity indices using certain convertible
 preferred investments, options, futures, and swap contracts not
 designated as hedging instruments. From time to time, to hedge our
 price risk, we may use and designate equity derivatives as hedging
 instruments, including puts, calls, swaps, and forwards. As of
 June 30, 2016, the total notional amounts of equity contracts
 purchased and sold for managing market price risk were $1.3 billion
 and $2.2 billion, respectively, of which $737 million and $986
 million, respectively, were designated as hedging instruments. As
 of June 30, 2015, the total notional amounts of equity
 contracts purchased and sold for managing market price risk were
 $2.2 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, of which $1.1 billion
 and $1.4 billion, respectively, were designated as hedging
 instruments.

Paragraph:
Interest Rate

Paragraph:
Securities held in our
 fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks
 based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of our
 fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate
 to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded
 option and futures contracts, and over-the-counter swap and option
 contracts, none of which are designated as hedging instruments. As
 of June 30, 2016, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest
 rate contracts purchased and sold were $328 million and $2.4
 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2015, the total notional
 amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were
 $1.0 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively.

Paragraph:
In addition, we use
 “To Be Announced” forward purchase commitments of
 mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed
 securities. These meet the definition of a derivative
 instrument in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not
 taken at the earliest available delivery date. As of June 30,
 2016 and 2015, the total notional derivative amounts of mortgage
 contracts purchased were $548 million and $812 million,
 respectively.

Paragraph:
Credit

Paragraph:
Our fixed-income
 portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade
 securities. We use credit default swap contracts, not designated as
 hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures relative to
 broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. We
 use credit default swaps as they are a low-cost method of managing
 exposure to individual credit risks or groups of credit risks. As
 of June 30, 2016, the total notional amounts of credit
 contracts purchased and sold were $440 million and $273 million,
 respectively. As of June 30, 2015, the total notional amounts
 of credit contracts purchased and sold were $618 million and $430
 million, respectively.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Commodity

Paragraph:
We use broad-based
 commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and to facilitate
 portfolio diversification. We use swaps, futures, and option
 contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to generate and
 manage exposures to broad-based commodity indices. We use
 derivatives on commodities as they can be low-cost alternatives to
 the purchase and storage of a variety of commodities, including,
 but not limited to, precious metals, energy, and grain. As of
 June 30, 2016, the total notional amounts of commodity
 contracts purchased and sold were $631 million and $162 million,
 respectively. As of June 30, 2015, the total notional amounts
 of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $882 million and
 $316 million, respectively.

Paragraph:
Credit-Risk-Related Contingent
 Features

Paragraph:
Certain of our
 counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain
 provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term
 unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and
 require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. To the
 extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to
 post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to
 over-the-counter derivatives. As of June 30, 2016, our
 long-term unsecured debt rating was AAA, and cash investments were
 in excess of $1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral was required
 to be posted.

Paragraph:
Fair Values of Derivative
 Instruments

The following table

 hedging instruments (“designated hedge derivatives”)
 and not designated as hedging instruments (“non-designated

Paragraph:
Losses recognized in other income

Paragraph:
We estimate that $319
 million of net derivative gains included in AOCI as of
 June 30, 2016 will be reclassified into earnings within the
 following 12 months. No significant amounts of gains (losses) were
 reclassified from AOCI into earnings as a result of forecasted
 transactions that failed to occur during fiscal year
 2016.

Paragraph:
Non-Designated Derivative Gains
 (Losses)

Paragraph:
Gains (losses) from
 changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as
 hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net.
 These amounts are shown in the table below, with the exception of
 gains (losses) on derivatives presented in income statement line
 items other than other income (expense), net, which were immaterial
 for the periods presented. Other than those derivatives entered
 into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the
 gains (losses) below are generally economically offset by
 unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale
 securities and gains (losses) from foreign exchange rate changes on
 certain balance sheet amounts.

 — BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

Paragraph:
Mojang Synergies
 AB

Paragraph:
On
 November 6, 2014, we acquired Mojang Synergies AB
 (“Mojang”), the Swedish video game developer of the
 Minecraft gaming franchise, for $2.5 billion in cash, net of cash
 acquired. The addition of Minecraft and its community enhances our
 gaming portfolio across Windows, Xbox, and other ecosystems besides
 our own. The significant classes of assets and liabilities to which
 we allocated the purchase price were goodwill of $1.8 billion and
 identifiable intangible assets of $928 million, primarily
 marketing-related (trade names). The goodwill recognized in
 connection with the acquisition is primarily attributable to
 anticipated synergies from future growth, and is not expected to be
 deductible for tax purposes. We assigned the goodwill to More
 Personal Computing under our current segment structure.
 Identifiable intangible assets were assigned a total
 weighted-average amortization period of 6.3 years. Mojang has been
 included in our consolidated results of operations since the
 acquisition date.

Paragraph:
Nokia’s Devices
 and Services Business

Paragraph:
On
 April 25, 2014, we acquired substantially all of Nokia
 Corporation’s (“Nokia”) Devices and Services
 business (“NDS”) for a total purchase price of $9.4
 billion, including cash acquired of $1.5 billion (the
 “Acquisition”). The purchase price consisted primarily
 of cash of $7.1 billion and Nokia’s repurchase of convertible
 notes of $2.1 billion, which was a non-cash transaction, and
 liabilities assumed of $0.2 billion. The Acquisition was expected
 to accelerate the growth of our Devices business through faster
 innovation, synergies, and unified branding and
 marketing.

Paragraph:
The
 allocation of the purchase price to goodwill was completed as of
 March 31, 2015. The major classes of assets and liabilities to
 which we allocated the purchase price were as follows:

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Cash

Paragraph:
During
 the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we recorded $630 million of
 intangible and fixed asset impairment charges, and during the
 fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we recorded $7.5 billion of
 goodwill and asset impairment charges. The impairment charges for
 both periods related to our phone business. These costs are
 included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses on
 our consolidated income statement. See Note 10 –
 Goodwill and Note 11 – Intangible Assets for additional
 details.

Paragraph:
In May
 2016, we announced an agreement to sell our entry-level feature
 phone assets for $350 million. The transaction is expected to close
 in the second half of calendar year 2016, subject to regulatory
 approvals and other closing conditions.

Paragraph:
Our
 consolidated income statement for fiscal year 2014 included revenue
 and operating loss of $2.0 billion and $692 million, respectively,
 attributable to NDS since the Acquisition.

Paragraph:

 on an unaudited pro forma basis, as if the Acquisition had been
 consummated on July 1, 2012:

Paragraph:


Paragraph:

Paragraph:
Net income

Paragraph:
Diluted earnings per share

Paragraph:
These pro
 forma results were based on estimates and assumptions, which we
 believe are reasonable. They are not the results that would have
 been realized had we been a combined company during the periods
 presented and are not necessarily indicative of our consolidated
 results of operations in future periods. The pro forma results
 include adjustments primarily related to purchase accounting
 adjustments and the elimination of related party transactions
 between Microsoft and NDS. Acquisition costs and other nonrecurring
 charges incurred are included in the earliest period
 presented.

Paragraph:
During
 the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, we incurred $21 million of
 acquisition costs associated with the purchase of NDS. Acquisition
 costs are primarily comprised of transaction fees and direct
 acquisition costs, including legal, finance, consulting, and other
 professional fees. These costs are included in impairment,
 integration, and restructuring expenses on our consolidated income
 statement for fiscal year 2014.

Paragraph:
Certain
 concurrent transactions were recognized separately from the
 Acquisition. Prior to the Acquisition, we had joint strategic
 initiatives with Nokia; this contractual relationship was
 terminated in conjunction with the Acquisition. No gain or loss was
 recorded upon termination of this agreement, as it was determined
 to be at market value. In addition, we agreed to license
 Nokia’s mapping services and will pay Nokia separately for
 the services provided under a four-year license as they are
 rendered.

Paragraph:

Paragraph:
During
 fiscal year 2016, we completed 17 acquisitions for total cash
 consideration of $1.4 billion. These entities have been included in

Paragraph:
The
 measurement periods for the valuation of assets acquired and
 liabilities assumed end as soon as information on the facts and
 circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates becomes
 available, but do not exceed 12 months. Adjustments in purchase
 price allocations may require a recasting of the amounts allocated
 to goodwill retroactive to the periods in which the acquisitions
 occurred.

Paragraph:
Any
 change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency
 translations and purchase accounting adjustments are presented as
 “Other” in the above table. Also included in
 “Other” are business dispositions and transfers between
 business segments due to reorganizations, as applicable. For fiscal
 year 2015, a $5.1 billion goodwill impairment charge was included
 in “Other,” as discussed below. This goodwill
 impairment charge was included in impairment, integration, and
 restructuring expenses on our consolidated income statement, and
 reflected in Corporate and Other in our table of operating income
 (loss) by segment in Note 21 – Segment Information and
 Geographic Data.

Paragraph:
Our
 accumulated goodwill impairment as of both June 30, 2016 and
 2015 was $11.3 billion.

Paragraph:
As
 discussed in Note 21 – Segment Information and Geographic
 Data, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 our chief
 operating decision maker requested changes in the information that
 he regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and
 assessing performance. This resulted in a change in our operating
 segments and reporting units. We allocated goodwill to our new
 reporting units using a relative fair value approach. In addition,
 we completed an assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for
 all reporting units immediately prior to the reallocation and
 determined that no impairment existed.

Paragraph:
Goodwill
 Impairment

Paragraph:
We test
 goodwill for impairment annually on May 1 at the reporting
 unit level, primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology with
 a peer-based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. We
 believe use of a discounted cash flow approach is the most reliable
 indicator of the fair values of the businesses.

Paragraph:
No
 instances of impairment were identified in our May 1, 2016
 test.

Paragraph:
Upon
 completion of the annual testing as of May 1, 2015, our
 previous Phone Hardware reporting unit goodwill was determined to
 be impaired. Phone Hardware goodwill is included in the Devices
 reporting unit within More Personal Computing under our current
 segment structure. In the second half of fiscal year 2015, Phone
 Hardware did not meet its sales volume and revenue goals, and the
 mix of units sold had lower margins than planned. These results,
 along with changes in the competitive marketplace and an evaluation
 of business priorities, led to a shift in strategic direction and
 reduced future revenue and profitability expectations for the
 business. As a result of these changes in strategy and
 expectations, we forecasted reductions in unit volume growth rates
 and lower future cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the
 Phone Hardware reporting unit, which resulted in the determination
 that an impairment adjustment was required.

Paragraph:
Because
 our annual test indicated that Phone Hardware’s carrying
 value exceeded its estimated fair value, a second phase of the
 goodwill impairment test (“Step 2”) was performed
 specific to Phone Hardware. Under Step 2, the fair value of all
 Phone Hardware assets and liabilities were estimated, including
 tangible assets, existing technology, patent agreements, and
 contractual arrangements, for the purpose of deriving an estimate
 of the implied fair value of goodwill. The implied fair value of
 the goodwill was then compared to the recorded goodwill to
 determine the amount of the impairment. Assumptions used in
 measuring the value of these assets and liabilities included the
 discount rates and royalty rates used in valuing the intangible
 assets, and consideration of the market environment in valuing the
 tangible assets.

Paragraph:
No other
 instances of impairment were identified in our May 1, 2015
 test.

Technology-based intangible assets included $115 million and

 net carrying amount of software to be sold, leased, or otherwise
 marketed.

Paragraph:
In the
 third quarter of fiscal year 2016, we corrected our intangible
 assets in the table above for a $585 million misstatement between
 gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization as of
 June 30, 2015. We do not consider this correction to be
 material, and there was no impact to our consolidated financial
 statements.

Paragraph:
During
 fiscal year 2016, we recorded impairment charges of $480 million
 related to intangible assets in the Devices reporting unit within
 our More Personal Computing segment. In the fourth quarter of
 fiscal year 2016, we tested these intangible assets for
 recoverability due to changes in facts and circumstances associated
 with the shift in strategic direction and reduced profitability
 expectations for our phone business. Based on the results of our
 testing, we determined that the carrying value of the intangible
 assets was not recoverable, and an impairment charge was recorded
 to the extent that estimated fair value exceeded carrying value. We
 primarily used the income approach to determine the fair value of
 the intangible assets and determine the amount of
 impairment.

Paragraph:
During
 fiscal year 2015, we recorded impairment charges of $2.2 billion
 related to intangible assets in our previous Phone Hardware
 reporting unit. Phone Hardware intangible assets are included in
 the Devices reporting unit under our current segment structure. In
 the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we tested these intangible
 assets for recoverability due to changes in facts and circumstances
 associated with the shift in strategic direction and reduced
 profitability expectations for Phone Hardware. Based on the results
 of our testing, we determined that the carrying value of the
 intangible assets was not recoverable, and an impairment charge was
 recorded to the extent that estimated fair value exceeded carrying
 value. We primarily used a relief from royalty income approach to
 determine the fair value of the intangible assets and determine the
 amount of impairment.

Paragraph:
These
 intangible assets impairment charges were included in impairment,
 integration, and restructuring expenses on our consolidated income
 statement, and reflected in Corporate and Other in our table of
 operating income (loss) by segment in Note 21 – Segment
 Information and Geographic Data.

Paragraph:
We estimate that we have
 no significant residual value related to our intangible

 81% of our foreign income before tax in fiscal years 2016, 2015,
 and 2014, respectively. In general, other reconciling items consist
 of interest, U.S. state income taxes, and credits. In fiscal years
 2016, 2015, and 2014, there were no individually significant other
 reconciling items.

Paragraph:
The
 decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 compared to
 fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to changes in the mix of our
 income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries,
 including the net impact of revenue deferrals related to sales of
 Windows 10, tax benefits from the adoption of the new accounting
 guidance relating to stock-based compensation, and distributions
 from foreign affiliates. The fiscal year 2015 effective tax rate
 included the tax impact of losses in foreign jurisdictions for
 which we may not realize a tax benefit, primarily as a result of
 impairment and restructuring charges.

Paragraph:
The
 components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were
 as follows:

Paragraph:


Paragraph:

Paragraph:
Balances as of June 30, 2015 reflect the impact of the
 adoption of the new accounting standard in fiscal year 2016 related
 to balance sheet classification of deferred taxes. See Note 1
 – Accounting Policies for additional details.

Paragraph:
As of
 June 30, 2016, we had net operating loss carryforwards of $8.0
 billion, including $6.3 billion of foreign net operating loss
 carryforwards. The valuation allowance disclosed in the table above
 relates to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards and other
 net deferred tax assets that may not be realized.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Deferred
 income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences
 between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their
 tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in
 effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered.

Paragraph:
As of
 June 30, 2016, we have not provided deferred U.S. income taxes
 or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences of
 approximately $124.0 billion resulting from earnings for certain
 non-U.S. subsidiaries which are permanently reinvested outside the
 U.S. The unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these
 temporary differences was approximately $39.3 billion as of
 June 30, 2016.

Paragraph:
Income
 taxes paid were $3.9 billion, $4.4 billion, and $5.5 billion in
 fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

Paragraph:
Tax
 contingencies and other income tax liabilities were $11.8 billion
 and $12.1 billion as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
 and are included in other long-term liabilities. This decrease
 relates primarily to tax credits available for carryover and a
 partial settlement of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009,
 offset by increases relating to intercompany transfer
 pricing.

Paragraph:
Uncertain Tax
 Positions

Paragraph:
Unrecognized tax benefits as of June 30, 2016, 2015, and
 2014, were $10.2 billion, $9.6 billion, and $8.7 billion,
 respectively. If recognized, these tax benefits would affect our
 effective tax rates for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, by $8.8
 billion, $7.9 billion, and $7.0 billion, respectively.

Paragraph:
As of
 June 30, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we had accrued interest expense
 related to uncertain tax positions of $1.9 billion, $1.7 billion,
 and $1.5 billion, respectively, net of federal income tax benefits.
 Interest expense on unrecognized tax benefits was $163 million,
 $237 million, and $235 million in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and
 2014, respectively, and was included in provision for income
 taxes.

Paragraph:
The
 aggregate changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were
 as follows:

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Balance, beginning of year

Paragraph:
Decreases related to
 settlements

Paragraph:
Increases for tax positions related
 to the current year

Paragraph:
Increases for tax positions related
 to prior years

Paragraph:
Decreases for tax positions related
 to prior years

Paragraph:
Decreases due to lapsed statutes of
 limitations

Paragraph:
Balance, end of year

Paragraph:
While we
 settled a portion of our IRS audit for tax years 2004 to 2006
 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, and settled a portion
 of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 during the first
 quarter of fiscal year 2016, we remain under audit for those years.
 In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report
 for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the
 examination. As of June 30, 2016, the primary unresolved issue
 relates to transfer pricing, which could have a significant impact
 on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably.
 We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are
 adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the
 unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these
 issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information
 currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or
 decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next
 12 months. We also continue to be subject to examination by the IRS
 for tax years 2010 to 2016.

Paragraph:
We are
 subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our
 operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination
 for tax years 1996 to 2016, some of which are currently under audit
 by local tax authorities. The resolutions of these audits are not
 expected to be material to our consolidated financial
 statements.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
The entire disclosure for income taxes. Disclosures may include net deferred tax liability or asset recognized in an enterprise's statement of financial position, net change during the year in the total valuation allowance, approximate tax effect of each type of temporary difference and carryforward that gives rise to a significant portion of deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets, utilization of a tax carryback, and tax uncertainties information.

NOTE 14
 — RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

Paragraph:
Phone Hardware
 Integration

Paragraph:
In July
 2014, we announced a restructuring plan to simplify our
 organization and align NDS with our company’s overall
 strategy (the “Phone Hardware Integration Plan”).
 Pursuant to the Phone Hardware Integration Plan, we eliminated
 approximately 19,000 positions in fiscal year 2015, including
 approximately 13,000 professional and factory positions related to
 the NDS business. The actions associated with the Phone Hardware
 Integration Plan were completed as of June 30,
 2015.

Paragraph:
In
 connection with the Phone Hardware Integration Plan, we incurred
 total restructuring charges of $1.3 billion, including severance
 expenses and other reorganization costs, primarily associated with
 our facilities consolidation and write-downs of certain assets. All
 restructuring charges incurred under the Phone Hardware Integration
 Plan were recognized in fiscal year 2015.

Paragraph:
Phone Hardware
 Restructuring

Paragraph:
In June
 2015, management approved a plan to restructure our phone business
 to better focus and align resources (the “Phone Hardware
 Restructuring Plan”), under which we eliminated approximately
 7,400 positions in fiscal year 2016.

Paragraph:
In fiscal
 year 2015, we incurred restructuring charges of $780 million under
 the Phone Hardware Restructuring Plan, including severance expenses
 and other reorganization costs. In fiscal year 2016, we reversed
 $21 million of previously estimated restructuring charges related
 to contract termination costs. The actions associated with the
 Phone Hardware Restructuring Plan were substantially complete as of
 June 30, 2016, and are expected to be completed by the end of
 calendar year 2016.

Paragraph:
2016
 Restructuring

Paragraph:
We
 periodically evaluate how to best deploy the company’s
 resources. In the fourth quarter of 2016, management approved
 restructuring plans that would result in job eliminations,
 primarily across our smartphone hardware business and global sales.
 In addition to the elimination of 1,850 positions that were
 announced in May 2016, approximately 2,850 roles globally will be
 reduced during the year as an extension of the earlier plan, and
 these actions are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal
 year 2017.

Paragraph:
In
 connection with the restructuring plans, we incurred restructuring
 charges of $501 million in fiscal year 2016, including severance
 expenses and other reorganization costs. We do not expect to incur
 additional charges for these restructuring plans in subsequent
 years.

Paragraph:
Restructuring charges associated with each of these plans were
 included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses on
 our consolidated income statement, and reflected in Corporate and
 Other in our table of operating income (loss) by segment in Note
 21– Segment Information and Geographic Data.

Paragraph:
Changes
 in the restructuring liability were as follows:

Paragraph:
The entire disclosure for deferred revenues at the end of the reporting period, and description and amounts of significant changes that occurred during the reporting period. Deferred revenue is a liability as of the balance sheet date related to a revenue producing activity for which revenue has not yet been recognized. Generally, an entity records deferred revenue when it receives consideration from a customer before achieving certain criteria that must be met for revenue to be recognized in conformity with GAAP.

Patent and
 Intellectual Property Claims

Paragraph:
IPCom patent
 litigation

Paragraph:
IPCom
 GmbH & Co. (“IPCom”) is a German company that
 holds a large portfolio of mobile technology-related patents
 spanning about 170 patent families and addressing a broad range of
 cellular technologies. IPCom has asserted 19 of these patents in
 litigation against Nokia and many of the leading cell phone
 companies and operators. In November 2014, Microsoft and IPCom
 entered into a standstill agreement staying all of the pending
 litigation against Microsoft to permit the parties to pursue
 settlement discussions.

Paragraph:
InterDigital patent
 litigation

Paragraph:
InterDigital Technology Corporation and InterDigital
 Communications Corporation (collectively, “IDT”) filed
 four patent infringement cases against Nokia in the International
 Trade Commission (“ITC”) and in U.S. District Court for
 the District of Delaware between 2007 and 2013. We have been added
 to these cases as a defendant. IDT has cases pending against other
 defendants based on the same patents because most of the patents at
 issue allegedly relate to 3G and 4G wireless communications
 standards essential functionality. The cases involving us include
 three ITC investigations where IDT sought an order excluding
 importation of 3G and 4G phones into the U.S. and one active case
 in U.S. District Court in Delaware seeking an injunction and
 damages. Each of the ITC matters has been resolved in our favor. In
 September 2015, in an 
inter
 partes
 review
 the United States Patent Trial and Appeal Board issued a final
 written decision that deemed unpatentable all asserted claims of
 the patent remaining at issue in the Delaware case. IDT has
 appealed this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
 Circuit. The Delaware case has been stayed pending final completion
 of the 
inter
 partes
 review
 (including appeals and any subsequent proceedings in the Patent
 Office). We filed an antitrust complaint against IDT in the
 District of Delaware in August 2015 asserting violations of
 Section 2 of the Sherman Act, alleging the unlawful
 exploitation of standard essential patents. IDT filed a motion to
 dismiss, which the District Court denied.

Paragraph:
European copyright
 levies

Paragraph:
We
 assumed from Nokia all potential liability due to Nokia’s
 alleged failure to pay “private copying levies” in
 various European countries based upon sale of memory cards and
 mobile phones that incorporate blank memory. The levies are
 based upon a 2001 European Union (“EU”) Directive
 establishing a right for end users to make copies of copyrighted
 works for personal or private use, but also allowing the collection
 of levies based upon sales of blank media or recording devices to
 compensate copyright holders for private copying. Various
 collecting societies in EU countries initiated litigation against
 Nokia, stating that Nokia must pay levies not only based upon sales
 of blank memory cards, but also phones that include blank memory
 for data storage on the phones, regardless of actual usage of that
 memory. The most significant cases against Nokia are pending
 in Germany and Austria, due to both the high volume of sales and
 high levy amounts sought in these countries. In December 2015, the
 industry group BITKOM, of which we are a member, reached a
 settlement with the German collecting society for all claims from
 2008 forward, leaving litigation only for the period 2004-2007
 pending in Germany. In addition, the industry is engaged in
 settlement negotiations with the Austrian collecting society. We
 have also settled copyright levies litigation in Spain and
 France.

In

Paragraph:
Product-Related
 Litigation

Paragraph:
U.S. cell phone
 litigation

Paragraph:
Nokia,
 along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a
 defendant in 19 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for the
 District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio
 emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and
 other adverse health effects. We assumed responsibility for these
 claims as part of the NDS acquisition and have been substituted for
 the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and
 are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining
 10 cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of
 Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health
 effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that
 operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio
 frequency emission guidelines (“FCC Guidelines”) are
 pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their
 handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were
 manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The
 lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the
 science and testing around emission guidelines.

Paragraph:
In 2013,
 defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude
 plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general causation on the basis
 of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the court granted in
 part defendants’ motion to exclude plaintiffs’ general
 causation experts. The plaintiffs filed an interlocutory appeal
 challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence,
 which the District of Columbia Court of Appeals agreed to
 hear 
en
 banc
. Trial court proceedings are stayed pending resolution of
 the appeal.

Paragraph:
Canadian cell phone
 class action

Paragraph:
Nokia,
 along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a
 defendant in a 2013 class action lawsuit filed in the Supreme Court
 of British Columbia by a purported class of Canadians who have used
 cellular phones for at least 1,600 hours, including a subclass of
 users with brain tumors. Microsoft was served with the complaint in
 June 2014 and has been substituted for the Nokia defendants. The
 litigation is not yet active as several defendants remain to be
 served.

Paragraph:
Other

Paragraph:
We also
 are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from
 time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although
 management currently believes that resolving claims against us,
 individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse
 impact on our consolidated financial statements, these matters are
 subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of
 these matters may change in the future.

Paragraph:
As of
 June 30, 2016, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $521
 million in other current liabilities. While we intend to defend
 these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could
 reach approximately $1.6 billion in aggregate beyond recorded
 amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to
 occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on
 our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the
 effects become reasonably estimable.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Indemnifications

Paragraph:
We
 provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain
 customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made
 by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain
 other matters. Additionally, we have agreed to cover damages
 resulting from breaches of certain security and privacy commitments
 in our cloud business. We evaluate estimated losses for these
 indemnifications, and we consider such factors as the degree of

 — SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

Paragraph:
In its
 operation of the business, management, including our chief
 operating decision maker, reviews certain financial information,
 including segmented internal profit and loss statements prepared on
 a basis not consistent with U.S. GAAP.

Paragraph:
In June
 2015, we announced a change in organizational structure to align to
 our strategic direction as a productivity and platform company.
 During the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, our chief operating
 decision maker requested changes in the information that he
 regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and
 assessing performance. As a result, beginning in fiscal year 2016,
 we report our financial performance based on our new segments,
 Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More
 Personal Computing, and analyze operating income as the measure of
 segment profitability. We have recast certain prior period amounts
 to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor segment
 performance.

Paragraph:
Our
 reportable segments are described below.

Revenue
 and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments.
 However, due to the integrated structure of our business, certain

 other segments. Revenue on certain contracts is allocated among the
 segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and
 services, which can include allocation based on actual prices
 charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a
 profit margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based
 on a relative revenue methodology. Operating expenses that are
 allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products
 and services from which multiple segments benefit, and are
 generally allocated based on relative gross margin.

 identifiable and that benefit our segments are allocated to them.
 These allocated costs include costs of: legal, including
 settlements, and fines; information technology; human resources;
 finance; excise taxes; field selling; shared facilities services;
 and customer service and support. Each allocation is measured
 differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the
 costs being allocated. Certain corporate-level activity is not
 allocated to our segments, including impairment, integration, and

Paragraph:
Accounting
 Principles

Paragraph:
The consolidated
 financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in
 accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
 United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

Paragraph:
We have recast certain
 prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation,
 with no impact on consolidated net income or cash flows.

Paragraph:
Principles of
 Consolidation

Paragraph:
The consolidated
 financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation
 and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have
 been eliminated. Equity investments through which we are able to
 exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee
 and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee’s
 activities are accounted for using the equity method. Investments
 through which we are not able to exercise significant influence
 over the investee and which do not have readily determinable fair
 values are accounted for under the cost method.

Paragraph:
Segment
 Information

Paragraph:
In June
 2015, we announced a change in organizational structure to align to
 our strategic direction as a productivity and platform company.
 During the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, our chief operating
 decision maker, who is also our Chief Executive Officer, requested
 changes in the information that he regularly reviews for purposes
 of allocating resources and assessing performance. As a result,
 beginning in fiscal year 2016, we report our financial performance
 based on our new segments described in Note 21 – Segment
 Information and Geographic Data. We have recast certain prior
 period amounts to conform to the way we internally manage and
 monitor segment performance during fiscal year 2016. This change
 primarily impacted Note 10 – Goodwill, Note 15 –
 Unearned Revenue, and Note 21 – Segment Information and
 Geographic Data, with no impact on consolidated net income or cash
 flows.

Paragraph:
Revenue and costs are
 generally directly attributed to our segments. However, due to the
 integrated structure of our business, certain revenue recognized
 and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments.
 Revenue on certain contracts is allocated among the segments based
 on the relative value of the underlying products and services,
 which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices
 when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. Cost
 of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative
 revenue methodology. Operating expenses that are allocated
 primarily include those relating to marketing of products and
 services from which multiple segments benefit, and are generally
 allocated based on relative gross margin.

Paragraph:
Estimates and
 Assumptions

Paragraph:
Preparing
 financial statements requires management to make estimates and
 assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
 liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates include:
 loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of, and/or
 potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, for our
 reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible
 and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; allowances
 for product returns; the market value of and volume of demand for
 our inventory; and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates.
 Examples of assumptions include: the elements comprising a software
 arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades or
 enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is
 achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax
 consequences of events that have been recognized on our
 consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining
 when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. Actual
 results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates
 and assumptions.

Paragraph:
Foreign Currencies

Paragraph:
Assets and liabilities
 recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate
 on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at
 average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation
 adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other
 comprehensive income (“OCI”).

Paragraph:
Product Revenue and
 Service and Other Revenue

Paragraph:
Service
 revenue exceeded 10% of total revenue for the first time in fiscal
 year 2016. As a result, we have separately disclosed product
 revenue and service and other revenue on our consolidated income
 statements.

Paragraph:
Product
 revenue includes sales from operating systems; cross-device
 productivity applications; server applications; business solution
 applications; desktop and server management tools; software
 development tools; video games; hardware such as PCs, tablets,
 gaming and entertainment consoles, phones, other intelligent
 devices, and related accessories; and training and certification of
 computer system integrators and developers.

Paragraph:
Service
 and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that
 provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content
 such as Office 365, Microsoft Azure (“Azure”),
 Microsoft Dynamics (“Dynamics”) CRM Online, and Xbox
 Live; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other
 revenue also includes sales from online advertising.

Paragraph:
Revenue Recognition

Paragraph:
Revenue is recognized
 when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
 occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is
 probable. Revenue generally is recognized net of allowances for
 returns and any taxes collected from customers and subsequently
 remitted to governmental authorities.

Paragraph:
Revenue recognition for
 multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if
 multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted for as
 separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of
 the elements.

Paragraph:
Microsoft enters into
 arrangements that can include various combinations of software,
 services, and hardware. Where elements are delivered over different
 periods of time, and when allowed under U.S. GAAP, revenue is
 allocated to the respective elements based on their relative
 selling prices at the inception of the arrangement, and revenue is
 recognized as each element is delivered. We use a hierarchy to
 determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to
 elements: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value
 (“VSOE”), (ii) third-party evidence, and
 (iii) best estimate of selling price (“ESP”). For
 software elements, we follow the industry specific software
 guidance which only allows for the use of VSOE in establishing fair
 value. Generally, VSOE is the price charged when the deliverable is
 sold separately or the price established by management for a
 product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will
 not change before introduction into the marketplace. ESPs are
 established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be
 if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. Our
 process for determining ESPs requires judgment and considers
 multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique
 facts and circumstances related to each deliverable.

Paragraph:
Revenue for retail
 packaged products, products licensed to original equipment
 manufacturers (“OEMs”), and perpetual licenses under
 certain volume licensing programs generally is recognized as
 products are shipped or made available.

Paragraph:
Technology guarantee
 programs are accounted for as multiple-element arrangements as
 customers receive free or significantly discounted rights to use
 upcoming new versions of a software product if they license
 existing versions of the product during the eligibility period.
 Revenue is allocated between the existing product and the new
 product, and revenue allocated to the new product is deferred until
 that version is delivered. The revenue allocation is based on the
 VSOE of fair value of the products. The VSOE of fair value for
 upcoming new products are based on the price determined by
 management having the relevant authority when the element is not
 yet sold separately, but is expected to be sold in the near future
 at the price set by management.

Paragraph:
Software updates that
 will be provided free of charge are evaluated on a case-by-case
 basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade
 and create a multiple-element arrangement, which may require
 revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is
 delivered, or if it is determined that implied post-contract
 customer support (“PCS”) is being provided, the
 arrangement is accounted for as a multiple-element arrangement and
 all revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over
 the implied PCS term when the VSOE of fair value does not exist. If
 updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade,
 revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made
 available.

Paragraph:
Customers purchasing a
 Windows 10 license will receive unspecified updates and upgrades
 over the life of their Windows 10 device at no additional cost. As
 these updates and upgrades will not be sold on a stand-alone basis,
 we are unable to establish VSOE of fair value. Accordingly, revenue
 from licenses of Windows 10 is recognized ratably over the
 estimated life of the related device, which ranges between two to
 four years.

Paragraph:
Certain volume licensing
 arrangements include a perpetual license for current products
 combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of
 software products, which we have determined are additional software
 products and are therefore accounted for as subscriptions, with
 billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue
 ratably over the coverage period. Arrangements that include
 term-based licenses for current products with the right to use
 unspecified future versions of the software during the coverage
 period, are also accounted for as subscriptions, with revenue
 recognized ratably over the coverage period. Revenue from
 cloud-based services arrangements that allow for the use of a
 hosted software product or service over a contractually determined
 period of time without taking possession of software are accounted
 for as subscriptions with billings recorded as unearned revenue and
 recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period beginning on
 the date the service is made available to customers. Revenue from
 cloud-based services arrangements that are provided on a
 consumption basis (for example, the amount of storage used in a
 particular period) is recognized commensurate with the customer
 utilization of such resources.

Paragraph:
Some volume licensing
 arrangements include time-based subscriptions for cloud-based
 services and software offerings that are accounted for as
 subscriptions. These arrangements are considered multiple-element
 arrangements. However, because all elements are accounted for as
 subscriptions and have the same coverage period and delivery
 pattern, they have the same revenue recognition timing.

Paragraph:
Revenue related to
 Microsoft Surface (“Surface”) devices, Xbox consoles,
 games published by us, phones, and other hardware components is
 generally recognized when ownership is transferred to the resellers
 or to end customers when selling directly through Microsoft retail
 stores and online marketplaces. A portion of revenue may be
 deferred when these products are combined with software elements,
 and/or services. Revenue related to licensing for games published
 by third parties for use on the Xbox consoles is recognized when
 games are manufactured by the game publishers.

Paragraph:
Display advertising
 revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed. Search
 advertising revenue is recognized when the ad appears in the search
 results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been
 completed. Consulting services revenue is recognized as services
 are rendered, generally based on the negotiated hourly rate in the
 consulting arrangement and the number of hours worked during the
 period. Consulting revenue for fixed-price services arrangements is
 recognized as services are provided.

Paragraph:
Cost of Revenue

Paragraph:
Cost of revenue includes:
 manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs
 licensed; operating costs related to product support service
 centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include
 software on PCs sold by OEMs, to drive traffic to our websites, and
 to acquire online advertising space; costs incurred to support and
 maintain Internet-based products and services, including datacenter
 costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation
 adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting
 services; and the amortization of capitalized software development
 costs. Capitalized software development costs are amortized over
 the estimated lives of the products.

Paragraph:
Product Warranty

Paragraph:
We provide for the
 estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and
 software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized.
 For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical
 and projected product failure rates, historical and projected
 repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any).
 The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending
 upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but
 generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging
 from 90 days to three years. For software warranties, we
 estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches,
 over the estimated life of the software. We regularly reevaluate
 our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty
 liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.

Paragraph:
Research and
 Development

Paragraph:
Research and development
 expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based
 compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses
 associated with product development. Research and development
 expenses also include third-party development and programming
 costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for
 international markets, and the amortization of purchased software
 code and services content. Such costs related to software
 development are included in research and development expense until
 the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our
 software products, is generally shortly before the products are
 released to manufacturing. Once technological feasibility is
 reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of
 revenue over the estimated lives of the products.

Paragraph:
Sales and Marketing

Paragraph:
Sales and marketing
 expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based
 compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses
 associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of
 advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs.
 Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was
 $1.6 billion, $1.9 billion, and $2.3 billion in fiscal years 2016,
 2015, and 2014, respectively.

Paragraph:
Stock-Based
 Compensation

Paragraph:
Compensation cost for
 stock awards is measured at the fair value on the grant date and
 recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the
 related service period using the straight-line method. The fair
 value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common
 stock on the grant date less the present value of expected
 dividends not received during the vesting period. Compensation
 expense for the employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”)
 is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon
 purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.

Paragraph:
Income
 Taxes

Paragraph:
Income
 tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, the
 provision for U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of international
 subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently reinvested, and interest
 and penalties on uncertain tax positions. Certain income and
 expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements
 in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is
 reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported
 net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a
 tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income taxes are
 classified as long-term on our consolidated balance
 sheets.

Paragraph:
Fair Value
 Measurements

Paragraph:
We account for certain
 assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists
 three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used
 in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We
 categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these
 three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to
 the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels
 are:

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Level 1
 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted
 prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. Our
 Level 1 non-derivative investments primarily include U.S.
 government securities, domestic and international equities, and
 actively traded mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets
 and liabilities include those actively traded on
 exchanges.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Level 2
 – inputs are based upon quoted prices for
 similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical
 or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and
 model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for
 which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be
 corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full
 term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models
 project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a
 present value using market-based observable inputs including
 interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and
 forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. Our Level 2
 non-derivative investments consist primarily of corporate notes and
 bonds, common and preferred stock, mortgage- and asset-backed
 securities, U.S. government and agency securities, and foreign
 government bonds. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities
 primarily include certain over-the-counter option and swap
 contracts.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Level 3
 – inputs are generally unobservable and
 typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that
 market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
 The fair values are therefore determined using model-based
 techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash
 flow models. Our Level 3 non-derivative assets primarily comprise
 investments in common and preferred stock, and goodwill and
 intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an
 impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used in the models are
 significant to the fair values of the assets and
 liabilities.

Paragraph:
We measure certain
 assets, including our cost and equity method investments, at fair
 value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be
 other-than-temporarily impaired. The fair values of these
 investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the
 best information available, and may include quoted market prices,
 market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. An
 impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment
 exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be
 other-than-temporary.

Paragraph:
Our other current
 financial assets and our current financial liabilities have fair
 values that approximate their carrying values.

Paragraph:
Investments

Paragraph:
We consider all highly
 liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months
 or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair
 values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In
 general, investments with original maturities of greater than three
 months and remaining maturities of less than one year are
 classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities
 beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their
 highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities
 represent the investment of cash that is available for current
 operations. All cash equivalents and short-term investments are
 classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are
 recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in
 market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are
 reflected in OCI.

Paragraph:
Equity and other
 investments classified as long-term include both debt and equity
 instruments. Debt and publicly-traded equity securities are
 classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are
 recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in the
 market value of available-for-sale securities, excluding
 other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in OCI. Common and
 preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more
 than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost or
 using the equity method.

Paragraph:
We lend certain
 fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns.
 These transactions are accounted for as secured borrowings and the
 loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our
 consolidated balance sheets. Cash and/or security interests are
 received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount
 determined based upon the underlying security lent and the
 creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is recorded as an
 asset with a corresponding liability.

Paragraph:
Investments are
 considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to
 be other-than-temporary. Fair value is calculated based on publicly
 available market information or other estimates determined by
 management. We employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis
 that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in
 evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of
 an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other
 factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt
 instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value
 is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and
 ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed-income
 securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the
 security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to
 sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific
 adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business
 outlook for the investee, including industry and sector
 performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing
 cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be
 other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other
 income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is
 established.

Paragraph:
Derivatives

Paragraph:
Derivative instruments
 are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at
 fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a
 derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the
 resulting designation.

Paragraph:
For derivative
 instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains (losses) are
 recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the
 offsetting losses (gains) on the hedged items attributed to the
 risk being hedged. For options designated as fair value hedges,
 changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge
 effectiveness and are recognized in earnings.

Paragraph:
For derivative
 instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion
 of the gains (losses) on the derivatives is initially reported as a
 component of OCI and is subsequently recognized in earnings when
 the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For options
 designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are
 excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are
 recognized in earnings. Gains (losses) on derivatives representing
 either hedge components excluded from the assessment of
 effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in
 earnings.

Paragraph:
For derivative
 instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains (losses) from
 changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income
 (expense), net. Other than those derivatives entered into for
 investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains
 (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains
 (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities, which are
 recorded as a component of OCI until the securities are sold or
 other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are
 reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income
 (“AOCI”) into other income (expense), net.

Paragraph:
Allowance for Doubtful
 Accounts

Paragraph:
The allowance for
 doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses
 inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the
 allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience,
 and other currently available evidence. Activity in the allowance
 for doubtful accounts was as follows:

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Balance, beginning of
 period

Paragraph:
Charged to costs and other

Paragraph:
Write-offs

Paragraph:
Balance, end of period

Paragraph:
Inventories

Paragraph:
Inventories are stated at
 average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. Cost includes
 materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the
 purchase and production of inventories. We regularly review
 inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our
 suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our
 review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we
 reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost
 of revenue.

Paragraph:
Property and
 Equipment

Paragraph:
Property and equipment is
 stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using
 the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful
 life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of
 our property and equipment are generally as follows: computer
 software developed or acquired for internal use, three to seven
 years; computer equipment, two to three years; buildings and
 improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, three to 20
 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. Land is not
 depreciated.

Paragraph:
Goodwill

Paragraph:
Goodwill is tested for
 impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one
 level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us)
 and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change
 that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a
 reporting unit below its carrying value.

Paragraph:
Intangible Assets

Paragraph:
All of our intangible
 assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the
 straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit,
 ranging from one to 15 years. We evaluate the recoverability of
 intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or
 circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or
 that indicate the asset may be impaired.

Paragraph:
Improvements to
 Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting

Paragraph:
In March
 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
 issued a new standard that changes the accounting for certain
 aspects of share-based payments to employees. The new guidance
 requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded in
 the income statement when stock awards vest or are settled. In
 addition, cash flows related to excess tax benefits will no longer
 be separately classified as a financing activity apart from other
 income tax cash flows. The standard also allows us to repurchase
 more of an employee’s vesting shares for tax withholding
 purposes without triggering liability accounting, clarifies that
 all cash payments made to tax authorities on an employee’s
 behalf for withheld shares should be presented as a financing
 activity on our cash flows statement, and provides an accounting
 policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. The new
 standard is effective for us beginning July 1, 2017, with
 early adoption permitted.

Paragraph:
We
 elected to early adopt the new guidance in the third quarter of
 fiscal year 2016 which requires us to reflect any adjustments as of
 July 1, 2015, the beginning of the annual period that includes
 the interim period of adoption. The primary impact of adoption was
 the recognition of excess tax benefits in our provision for income
 taxes rather than paid-in capital for all periods in fiscal year
 2016. Additional amendments to the accounting for income taxes
 and minimum statutory withholding tax requirements had no impact to
 retained earnings as of July 1, 2015, where the cumulative
 effect of these changes are required to be recorded. We have
 elected to continue to estimate forfeitures expected to occur to
 determine the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each
 period.

Paragraph:
We
 elected to apply the presentation requirements for cash flows
 related to excess tax benefits retrospectively to all periods
 presented which resulted in an increase to both net cash from
 operations and net cash used in financing of $588 million and $271
 million for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014,
 respectively. The presentation requirements for cash flows related
 to employee taxes paid for withheld shares had no impact to any of
 the periods presented on our consolidated cash flows statements
 since such cash flows have historically been presented as a
 financing activity.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
Adoption
 of the new standard resulted in the recognition of excess tax
 benefits in our provision for income taxes rather than paid-in
 capital of $402 million for the year ended June 30,
 2016.

Paragraph:
Balance Sheet
 Classification of Deferred Taxes

Paragraph:
In
 November 2015, the FASB issued guidance that requires companies to
 classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on
 the balance sheet rather than separately disclosing deferred taxes
 as current and noncurrent. This standard is effective for us
 beginning July 1, 2017, and can be early adopted and applied
 either prospectively or retrospectively to all periods presented
 upon adoption.

Paragraph:
We
 elected to early adopt the new guidance in the fourth quarter of
 fiscal year 2016 on a retrospective basis. While the guidance
 changes the manner in which deferred taxes are classified on the
 balance sheet, we are still required to offset deferred tax assets
 and liabilities for each taxpaying component within a tax
 jurisdiction. Adoption of the new standard impacted our previously
 reported results as follows:

Financial Instruments
 – Credit Losses

Paragraph:
In June
 2016, the FASB issued a new standard to replace the incurred loss
 impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that
 reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a
 broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform
 credit loss estimates. For trade and other receivables, loans, and
 other financial instruments, we will be required to use a
 forward-looking expected loss model rather than the incurred loss
 model for recognizing credit losses which reflects losses that are
 probable. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt
 securities will also be recorded through an allowance for credit
 losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of
 the securities. The new standard will be effective for us beginning
 July 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted beginning
 July 1, 2019. Application of the amendments is through a
 cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the
 effective date. We are currently evaluating the impact of this
 standard on our consolidated financial statements.

Paragraph:
Leases

Paragraph:
In
 February 2016, the FASB issued a new standard related to leases to
 increase transparency and comparability among organizations by
 requiring the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on
 the balance sheet. Most prominent among the amendments is the
 recognition of assets and liabilities by lessees for those leases
 classified as operating leases under previous U.S. GAAP. Under the
 new standard, disclosures are required to meet the objective of
 enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount,
 timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. We will
 be required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the
 earliest period presented using a modified retrospective
 approach.

Paragraph:
The new
 standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2019, with
 early adoption permitted. We currently anticipate early adoption of
 the new standard effective July 1, 2017 in conjunction with
 our adoption of the new revenue standard. Our ability to early
 adopt is dependent on system readiness, including software procured
 from third-party providers, and the completion of our analysis of
 information necessary to restate prior period financial
 statements.

Paragraph:


Paragraph:
We
 anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our
 consolidated financial statements. While we are continuing to
 assess all potential impacts of the standard, we currently believe
 the most significant impact relates to our accounting for office,
 retail, and datacenter operating leases.

Paragraph:
Financial Instruments
 – Recognition, Measurement, Presentation, and
 Disclosure

Paragraph:
In
 January 2016, the FASB issued a new standard to amend certain
 aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure
 of financial instruments. Most prominent among the amendments is
 the requirement for changes in the fair value of our equity
 investments, with certain exceptions, to be recognized through net
 income rather than OCI. The new standard will be effective for us
 beginning July 1, 2018. The application of the amendments will
 result in a cumulative-effect adjustment to our consolidated
 balance sheets as of the effective date. We are currently
 evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated
 financial statements.

Paragraph:
Revenue from Contracts
 with Customers

Paragraph:
In May
 2014, the FASB issued a new standard related to revenue
 recognition. Under the new standard, revenue is recognized when a
 customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is
 recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the
 entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
 In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature,
 amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising
 from contracts with customers. The FASB has recently issued several
 amendments to the standard, including clarification on accounting
 for licenses of intellectual property and identifying performance
 obligations.

Paragraph:
The
 guidance permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each
 prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or
 retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying
 the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the
 cumulative catch-up transition method). We currently anticipate
 adopting the standard using the full retrospective method to
 restate each prior reporting period presented.

Paragraph:
The new
 standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2018, and
 adoption as of the original effective date of July 1, 2017 is
 permitted. We currently anticipate early adoption of the new
 standard effective July 1, 2017. Our ability to early adopt
 using the full retrospective method is dependent on system
 readiness, including software procured from third-party providers,
 and the completion of our analysis of information necessary to
 restate prior period financial statements.

Paragraph:
We
 anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our
 consolidated financial statements. While we are continuing to
 assess all potential impacts of the standard, we currently believe
 the most significant impact relates to our accounting for software
 license revenue. We expect revenue related to hardware, cloud
 offerings, and professional services to remain substantially
 unchanged. Specifically, under the new standard we expect to
 recognize Windows 10 revenue predominantly at the time of billing
 rather than ratably over the life of the related device. We also
 expect to recognize license revenue at the time of billing rather
 than over the subscription period from certain multi-year
 commercial software subscriptions that include both software
 licenses and Software Assurance. Due to the complexity of certain
 of our commercial license subscription contracts, the actual
 revenue recognition treatment required under the standard will be
 dependent on contract-specific terms, and may vary in some
 instances from recognition at the time of billing.

Paragraph:
We
 currently believe that the net change in Windows 10 revenue from
 period to period is indicative of the net change in revenue we
 expect from the adoption of the new standard.

Disclosure of accounting policy regarding (1) the principles it follows in consolidating or combining the separate financial statements, including the principles followed in determining the inclusion or exclusion of subsidiaries or other entities in the consolidated or combined financial statements and (2) its treatment of interests (for example, common stock, a partnership interest or other means of exerting influence) in other entities, for example consolidation or use of the equity or cost methods of accounting.  The accounting policy may also address the accounting treatment for intercompany accounts and transactions, noncontrolling interest, and the income statement treatment in consolidation for issuances of stock by a subsidiary.

['- DefinitionCash includes currency on hand as well as demand deposits with banks or financial institutions. It also includes other kinds of accounts that have the general characteristics of demand deposits in that the customer may deposit additional funds at any time and effectively may withdraw funds at any time without prior notice or penalty. Cash equivalents, excluding items classified as marketable securities, include short-term, highly liquid Investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and so near their maturity that they present minimal risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Generally, only investments with original maturities of three months or less qualify under that definition. Original maturity means original maturity to the entity holding the investment. For example, both a three-month US Treasury bill and a three-year Treasury note purchased three months from maturity qualify as cash equivalents. However, a Treasury note purchased three years ago does not become a cash equivalent when its remaining maturity is three months. Short-term investments, exclusive of cash equivalents, generally consist of marketable securities intended to be sold within one year (or the normal operating cycle if longer) and may include trading securities, available-for-sale securities, or held-to-maturity securities (if maturing within one year), as applicable.\n+ ReferencesReference 1: http://www.xbrl.org/2003/role/presentationRef -Publisher FASB -Name Accounting Standards Codification -Glossary Cash Equivalents -URI http://asc.fasb.org/extlink&oid=6507016Reference 2: http://www.xbrl.org/2003/role/presentationRef -Publisher FASB -Name Accounting Standards Codification -Glossary Cash -URI http://asc.fasb.org/extlink&oid=6506951Reference 3: http://www.xbrl.org/2003/role/presentationRef -Publisher FASB -Name Accounting Standards Codification -Topic 210 -SubTopic 10 -Section S99 -Paragraph 1 -Subparagraph (SX 210.5-02.1) -URI http://asc.fasb.org/extlink&oid=6877327&loc=d3e13212-122682\n+ Details\n\n Name:\nus-gaap_CashCashEquivalentsAndShortTermInvestments\n\n\n Namespace Prefix:\nus-gaap_\n\n\n Data Type:\nxbrli:monetaryItemType\n\n\n Balance Type:\ndebit\n\n\n Period Type:\ninstant', 'Name:', 'us-gaap_CashCashEquivalentsAndShortTermInvestments', 'Namespace Prefix:', 'us-gaap_', 'Data Type:', 'xbrli:monetaryItemType', 'Balance Type:', 'debit', 'Period Type:', 'instant']

['ACCOUNTING POLICIES', 'NOTE 1\n — ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nAccounting\n Principles\nThe\n consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are\n prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\n accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.\n GAAP”).\nWe have\n recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current\n period presentation, with no impact on consolidated net income or\n cash flows.\n\nPrinciples of\n Consolidation\nThe\n consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft\n Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and\n balances have been eliminated. Equity investments through which we\n are able to exercise significant influence over but do not control\n the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the\n investee’s activities are accounted for using the equity\n method. Investments through which we are not able to exercise\n significant influence over the investee and which do not have\n readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost\n method.\n\nSegment\n Information\nIn June\n 2015, we announced a change in organizational structure to align to\n our strategic direction as a productivity and platform company.\n During the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, our chief operating\n decision maker, who is also our Chief Executive Officer, requested\n changes in the information that he regularly reviews for purposes\n of allocating resources and assessing performance. As a result,\n beginning in fiscal year 2016, we report our financial performance\n based on our new segments described in Note 21 – Segment\n Information and Geographic Data. We have recast certain prior\n period amounts to conform to the way we internally manage and\n monitor segment performance during fiscal year 2016. This change\n primarily impacted Note 10 – Goodwill, Note 15 –\n Unearned Revenue, and Note 21 – Segment Information and\n Geographic Data, with no impact on consolidated net income or cash\n flows.\n\nEstimates and\n Assumptions\nPreparing\n financial statements requires management to make estimates and\n assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,\n liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates include:\n loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of, and/or\n potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, for our\n reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible\n and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; allowances\n for product returns; the market value of and volume of demand for\n our inventory; and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates.\n Examples of assumptions include: the elements comprising a software\n arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades or\n enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is\n achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax\n consequences of events that have been recognized on our\n consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining\n when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. Actual\n results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates\n and assumptions.\n\nForeign\n Currencies\nAssets\n and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at\n the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses\n are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the\n year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are\n recorded to other comprehensive income\n (“OCI”).\n\n \xa0\n\nProduct Revenue and\n Service and Other Revenue\nService\n revenue exceeded 10% of total revenue for the first time in fiscal\n year 2016. As a result, we have separately disclosed product\n revenue and service and other revenue on our consolidated income\n statements.\nProduct\n revenue includes sales from operating systems; cross-device\n productivity applications; server applications; business solution\n applications; desktop and server management tools; software\n development tools; video games; hardware such as PCs, tablets,\n gaming and entertainment consoles, phones, other intelligent\n devices, and related accessories; and training and certification of\n computer system integrators and developers.\nService\n and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that\n provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content\n such as Office 365, Microsoft Azure (“Azure”),\n Microsoft Dynamics (“Dynamics”) CRM Online, and Xbox\n Live; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other\n revenue also includes sales from online advertising.\n\nRevenue\n Recognition\nRevenue\n is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,\n delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and\n collectability is probable. Revenue generally is recognized net of\n allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers and\n subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\nRevenue\n recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to\n determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be\n accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair\n value for each of the elements.\nMicrosoft\n enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of\n software, services, and hardware. Where elements are delivered over\n different periods of time, and when allowed under U.S. GAAP,\n revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their\n relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement, and\n revenue is recognized as each element is delivered. We use a\n hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating\n revenue to elements: (i)\xa0vendor-specific objective evidence of\n fair value (“VSOE”), (ii)\xa0third-party evidence,\n and (iii)\xa0best estimate of selling price (“ESP”).\n For software elements, we follow the industry specific software\n guidance which only allows for the use of VSOE in establishing fair\n value. Generally, VSOE is the price charged when the deliverable is\n sold separately or the price established by management for a\n product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will\n not change before introduction into the marketplace. ESPs are\n established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be\n if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. Our\n process for determining ESPs requires judgment and considers\n multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique\n facts and circumstances related to each deliverable.\nRevenue\n for retail packaged products, products licensed to original\n equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), and perpetual\n licenses under certain volume licensing programs generally is\n recognized as products are shipped or made available.\nTechnology guarantee programs are accounted for as\n multiple-element arrangements as customers receive free or\n significantly discounted rights to use upcoming new versions of a\n software product if they license existing versions of the product\n during the eligibility period. Revenue is allocated between the\n existing product and the new product, and revenue allocated to the\n new product is deferred until that version is delivered. The\n revenue allocation is based on the VSOE of fair value of the\n products. The VSOE of fair value for upcoming new products are\n based on the price determined by management having the relevant\n authority when the element is not yet sold separately, but is\n expected to be sold in the near future at the price set by\n management.\nSoftware\n updates that will be provided free of charge are evaluated on a\n case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of\n an upgrade and create a multiple-element arrangement, which may\n require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is\n delivered, or if it is determined that implied post-contract\n customer support (“PCS”) is being provided, the\n arrangement is accounted for as a multiple-element arrangement and\n all revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over\n the implied PCS term when the VSOE of fair value does not exist. If\n updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade,\n revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made\n available.\nCustomers\n purchasing a Windows 10 license will receive unspecified updates\n and upgrades over the life of their Windows 10 device at no\n additional cost. As these updates and upgrades will not be sold on\n a stand-alone basis, we are unable to establish VSOE of fair value.\n Accordingly, revenue from licenses of Windows 10 is recognized\n ratably over the estimated life of the related device, which ranges\n between two to four years.\nCertain\n volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for\n current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future\n versions of software products, which we have determined are\n additional software products and are therefore accounted for as\n subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and\n recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period.\n Arrangements that include term-based licenses for current products\n with the right to use unspecified future versions of the software\n during the coverage period, are also accounted for as\n subscriptions, with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage\n period. Revenue from cloud-based services arrangements that allow\n for the use of a hosted software product or service over a\n contractually determined period of time without taking possession\n of software are accounted for as subscriptions with billings\n recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over\n the coverage period beginning on the date the service is made\n available to customers. Revenue from cloud-based services\n arrangements that are provided on a consumption basis (for example,\n the amount of storage used in a particular period) is recognized\n commensurate with the customer utilization of such\n resources.\nSome\n volume licensing arrangements include time-based subscriptions for\n cloud-based services and software offerings that are accounted for\n as subscriptions. These arrangements are considered\n multiple-element arrangements. However, because all elements are\n accounted for as subscriptions and have the same coverage period\n and delivery pattern, they have the same revenue recognition\n timing.\nRevenue\n related to Microsoft Surface (“Surface”) devices, Xbox\n consoles, games published by us, phones, and other hardware\n components is generally recognized when ownership is transferred to\n the resellers or to end customers when selling directly through\n Microsoft retail stores and online marketplaces. A portion of\n revenue may be deferred when these products are combined with\n software elements, and/or services. Revenue related to licensing\n for games published by third parties for use on the Xbox consoles\n is recognized when games are manufactured by the game\n publishers.\nDisplay\n advertising revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed.\n Search advertising revenue is recognized when the ad appears in the\n search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has\n been completed. Consulting services revenue is recognized as\n services are rendered, generally based on the negotiated hourly\n rate in the consulting arrangement and the number of hours worked\n during the period. Consulting revenue for fixed-price services\n arrangements is recognized as services are provided.\n\nCost of\n Revenue\nCost of\n revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products\n sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product\n support service centers and product distribution centers; costs\n incurred to include software on PCs sold by OEMs, to drive traffic\n to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs\n incurred to support and maintain Internet-based products and\n services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs;\n inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery\n of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized\n software development costs. Capitalized software development costs\n are amortized over the estimated lives of the products.\n\nProduct\n Warranty\nWe\n provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under\n hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is\n recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on\n historical and projected product failure rates, historical and\n projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures\n (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary\n depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do\n business, but generally include parts and labor over a period\n generally ranging from 90\xa0days to three years. For software\n warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as\n security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We\n regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the\n recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as\n necessary.\n\nResearch and\n Development\nResearch\n and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits,\n stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related\n expenses associated with product development. Research and\n development expenses also include third-party development and\n programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate\n software for international markets, and the amortization of\n purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to\n software development are included in research and development\n expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached,\n which for our software products, is generally shortly before the\n products are released to manufacturing. Once technological\n feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to\n cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the\n products.\n\nSales and\n Marketing\nSales and\n marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based\n compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses\n associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of\n advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs.\n Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was\n $1.6 billion, $1.9 billion, and $2.3 billion in fiscal years 2016,\n 2015, and 2014, respectively.\n\nStock-Based\n Compensation\nCompensation cost for stock awards is measured at the fair\n value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated\n forfeitures, over the related service period using the\n straight-line method. The fair value of stock awards is based on\n the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the\n present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting\n period. Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan\n (“ESPP”) is measured as the discount the employee is\n entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of\n purchase.\n\nIncome\n Taxes\nIncome\n tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, the\n provision for U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of international\n subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently reinvested, and interest\n and penalties on uncertain tax positions. Certain income and\n expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements\n in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is\n reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported\n net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a\n tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income taxes are\n classified as long-term on our consolidated balance\n sheets.\n\nFair Value\n Measurements\nWe\n account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The\n hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the\n extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable\n in the market.\xa0We categorize each of our fair value\n measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level\n input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its\n entirety. These levels are:\n\n \xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n•\n\xa0\n\nLevel 1\xa0– inputs are based upon\n unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active\n markets. Our Level 1 non-derivative investments primarily include\n U.S. government securities, domestic and international equities,\n and actively traded mutual funds.\xa0Our Level 1 derivative\n assets and liabilities include those actively traded on\n exchanges.\n\n\n\n\n \xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n•\n\xa0\n\nLevel 2\xa0– inputs are based upon\n quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted\n prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not\n active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the\n Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are\n observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable\n market data for substantially the full term of the assets or\n liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash\n flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using\n market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves,\n credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices\n for currencies and commodities. Our Level 2 non-derivative\n investments consist primarily of corporate notes and bonds, common\n and preferred stock, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, U.S.\n government and agency securities, and foreign government bonds.

The fair values are therefore determined using\n model-based techniques, including option pricing models and\n discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 non-derivative assets\n primarily comprise investments in common and preferred stock, and\n goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair\n value due to an impairment charge.\xa0Unobservable inputs used in\n the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and\n liabilities.\n\n\n\nWe\n measure certain assets, including our cost and equity method\n investments, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are\n deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. The fair values of\n these investments are determined based on valuation techniques\n using the best information available, and may include quoted market\n prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections.\n An impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment\n exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be\n other-than-temporary.\nOur other\n current financial assets and our current financial liabilities have\n fair values that approximate their carrying values.\n\nFinancial\n Instruments\n\nInvestments\nWe\n consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a\n maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash\n equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their\n carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities\n of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than\n one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with\n maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on\n their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities\n represent the investment of cash that is available for current\n operations. All cash equivalents and short-term investments are\n classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are\n recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in\n market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are\n reflected in OCI.\nEquity\n and other investments classified as long-term include both debt and\n equity instruments. Debt and publicly-traded equity securities are\n classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are\n recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in the\n market value of available-for-sale securities, excluding\n other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in OCI. Common and\n preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more\n than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost or\n using the equity method.\nWe lend\n certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment\n returns. These transactions are accounted for as secured borrowings\n and the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on\n our consolidated balance sheets. Cash and/or security interests are\n received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount\n determined based upon the underlying security lent and the\n creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is recorded as an\n asset with a corresponding liability.\nInvestments are considered to be impaired when a decline in\n fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. Fair value is\n calculated based on publicly available market information or other\n estimates determined by management. We employ a systematic\n methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available\n quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential\n impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds\n its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market\n conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration\n and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for\n equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to\n sell, the investment. For fixed-income securities, we also evaluate\n whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely\n than not that we will be required to sell the security before\n recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to\n the financial health of and business outlook for the investee,\n including industry and sector performance, changes in technology,\n and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in\n fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment\n charge is recorded to other income (expense), net and a new cost\n basis in the investment is established.\n\nDerivatives\nDerivative instruments are recognized as either assets or\n liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for\n changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended\n use of the derivative and the resulting designation.\nFor\n derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains\n (losses) are recognized in earnings in the periods of change\n together with the offsetting losses (gains) on the hedged items\n attributed to the risk being hedged. For options designated as fair\n value hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the\n assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in\n earnings.\nFor\n derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the\n effective portion of the gains (losses) on the derivatives is\n initially reported as a component of OCI and is subsequently\n recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in\n earnings. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in\n the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge\n effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. Gains (losses) on\n derivatives representing either hedge components excluded from the\n assessment of effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized\n in earnings.\nFor\n derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains\n (losses) from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in\n other income (expense), net. Other than those derivatives entered\n into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the\n gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized\n gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities,\n which are recorded as a component of OCI until the securities are\n sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts\n are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income\n (“AOCI”) into other income (expense), net.\n\nAllowance for Doubtful\n Accounts\nThe\n allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of\n probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We\n determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts,\n historical experience, and other currently available evidence.\n Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as\n follows:\n\n \xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(In millions)\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear Ended June\xa030,\n\xa0\xa0\n2016\n\xa0\n\xa0\n2015\n\xa0\n\xa0\n2014\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalance, beginning of\n period\n\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n\xa0\xa0335\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n$\n\xa0\xa0301\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n$\n\xa0\xa0336\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\nCharged to costs and other\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n146\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n77\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n16\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\nWrite-offs\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n(55\n)\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n(43\n)\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n(51\n)\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalance, end of period\n\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n426\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n$\n335\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n$\n301\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInventories\nInventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of\n cost or market. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing\n overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. We\n regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase\n commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our\n inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below\n carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through\n a charge to cost of revenue.\n\nProperty and\n Equipment\nProperty\n and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and\n depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the\n estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated\n useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as\n follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use,\n three to seven years; computer equipment, two to three years;\n buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold\n improvements, three to 20 years; and furniture and equipment, one\n to 10 years. Land is not depreciated.\n\nGoodwill\nGoodwill\n is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating\n segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis\n (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or\n circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the\n fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.\n\nIntangible\n Assets\nAll of\n our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized\n using the straight-line method over their estimated period of\n benefit, ranging from one to 15 years. We evaluate the\n recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into\n account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates\n of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be\n impaired.\n\nRecent Accounting\n Guidance\n\nRecently adopted\n accounting guidance\n\nImprovements to\n Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\nIn March\n 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)\n issued a new standard that changes the accounting for certain\n aspects of share-based payments to employees. The new guidance\n requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded in\n the income statement when stock awards vest or are settled. In\n addition, cash flows related to excess tax benefits will no longer\n be separately classified as a financing activity apart from other\n income tax cash flows. The standard also allows us to repurchase\n more of an employee’s vesting shares for tax withholding\n purposes without triggering liability accounting, clarifies that\n all cash payments made to tax authorities on an employee’s\n behalf for withheld shares should be presented as a financing\n activity on our cash flows statement, and provides an accounting\n policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. The new\n standard is effective for us beginning July\xa01, 2017, with\n early adoption permitted.\nWe\n elected to early adopt the new guidance in the third quarter of\n fiscal year 2016 which requires us to reflect any adjustments as of\n July\xa01, 2015, the beginning of the annual period that includes\n the interim period of adoption. The primary impact of adoption was\n the recognition of excess tax benefits in our provision for income\n taxes rather than paid-in capital for all periods in fiscal year\n 2016.\xa0Additional amendments to the accounting for income taxes\n and minimum statutory withholding tax requirements had no impact to\n retained earnings as of July\xa01, 2015, where the cumulative\n effect of these changes are required to be recorded. We have\n elected to continue to estimate forfeitures expected to occur to\n determine the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each\n period.\nWe\n elected to apply the presentation requirements for cash flows\n related to excess tax benefits retrospectively to all periods\n presented which resulted in an increase to both net cash from\n operations and net cash used in financing of $588 million and $271\n million for the years ended June\xa030, 2015 and 2014,\n respectively. The presentation requirements for cash flows related\n to employee taxes paid for withheld shares had no impact to any of\n the periods presented on our consolidated cash flows statements\n since such cash flows have historically been presented as a\n financing activity.\n\n \xa0\nAdoption\n of the new standard resulted in the recognition of excess tax\n benefits in our provision for income taxes rather than paid-in\n capital of $402 million for the year ended June\xa030,\n 2016.\n\nBalance Sheet\n Classification of Deferred Taxes\nIn\n November 2015, the FASB issued guidance that requires companies to\n classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on\n the balance sheet rather than separately disclosing deferred taxes\n as current and noncurrent. This standard is effective for us\n beginning July\xa01, 2017, and can be early adopted and applied\n either prospectively or retrospectively to all periods presented\n upon adoption.\nWe\n elected to early adopt the new guidance in the fourth quarter of\n fiscal year 2016 on a retrospective basis. While the guidance\n changes the manner in which deferred taxes are classified on the\n balance sheet, we are still required to offset deferred tax assets\n and liabilities for each taxpaying component within a tax\n jurisdiction. Adoption of the new standard impacted our previously\n reported results as follows:\n\n \xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(In millions)\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\nJune\xa030,\n\n2015\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n \xa0\nAs\n adjusted\n\xa0\xa0\n \xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n \xa0\nAs\n reported\n\xa0\xa0\n \xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalance sheets:\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent deferred income tax\n assets\n\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n0\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n$\n1,915\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\nOther long-term assets\n\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n3,117\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n$\n2,953\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\nOther current liabilities\n\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n6,555\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n$\n6,766\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\nLong-term deferred income tax\n liabilities\n\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n\xa0\xa01,295\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n$\n\xa0\xa02,835\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent accounting\n guidance not yet adopted\n\nFinancial Instruments\n – Credit Losses\nIn June\n 2016, the FASB issued a new standard to replace the incurred loss\n impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that\n reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a\n broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform\n credit loss estimates. For trade and other receivables, loans, and\n other financial instruments, we will be required to use a\n forward-looking expected loss model rather than the incurred loss\n model for recognizing credit losses which reflects losses that are\n probable. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt\n securities will also be recorded through an allowance for credit\n losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of\n the securities. The new standard will be effective for us beginning\n July\xa01, 2020, with early adoption permitted beginning\n July\xa01, 2019. Application of the amendments is through a\n cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the\n effective date. We are currently evaluating the impact of this\n standard on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nLeases\nIn\n February 2016, the FASB issued a new standard related to leases to\n increase transparency and comparability among organizations by\n requiring the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on\n the balance sheet. Most prominent among the amendments is the\n recognition of assets and liabilities by lessees for those leases\n classified as operating leases under previous U.S. GAAP. Under the\n new standard, disclosures are required to meet the objective of\n enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount,\n timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. We will\n be required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the\n earliest period presented using a modified retrospective\n approach.\nThe new\n standard will be effective for us beginning July\xa01, 2019, with\n early adoption permitted. We currently anticipate early adoption of\n the new standard effective July\xa01, 2017 in conjunction with\n our adoption of the new revenue standard.\xa0Our ability to early\n adopt is dependent on system readiness, including software procured\n from third-party providers, and the completion of our analysis of\n information necessary to restate prior period financial\n statements.\n\n \xa0\nWe\n anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our\n consolidated financial statements. While we are continuing to\n assess all potential impacts of the standard, we currently believe\n the most significant impact relates to our accounting for office,\n retail, and datacenter operating leases.\n\nFinancial Instruments\n – Recognition, Measurement, Presentation, and\n Disclosure\nIn\n January 2016, the FASB issued a new standard to amend certain\n aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure\n of financial instruments. Most prominent among the amendments is\n the requirement for changes in the fair value of our equity\n investments, with certain exceptions, to be recognized through net\n income rather than OCI. The new standard will be effective for us\n beginning July\xa01, 2018. The application of the amendments will\n result in a cumulative-effect adjustment to our consolidated\n balance sheets as of the effective date. We are currently\n evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated\n financial statements.\n\nRevenue from Contracts\n with Customers\nIn May\n 2014, the FASB issued a new standard related to revenue\n recognition. Under the new standard, revenue is recognized when a\n customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is\n recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the\n entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.\n In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature,\n amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising\n from contracts with customers. The FASB has recently issued several\n amendments to the standard, including clarification on accounting\n for licenses of intellectual property and identifying performance\n obligations.\nThe\n guidance permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each\n prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or\n retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying\n the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the\n cumulative catch-up transition method). We currently anticipate\n adopting the standard using the full retrospective method to\n restate each prior reporting period presented.\nThe new\n standard will be effective for us beginning July\xa01, 2018, and\n adoption as of the original effective date of July\xa01, 2017 is\n permitted. We currently anticipate early adoption of the new\n standard effective July\xa01, 2017. Our ability to early adopt\n using the full retrospective method is dependent on system\n readiness, including software procured from third-party providers,\n and the completion of our analysis of information necessary to\n restate prior period financial statements.\nWe\n anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our\n consolidated financial statements. While we are continuing to\n assess all potential impacts of the standard, we currently believe\n the most significant impact relates to our accounting for software\n license revenue. We expect revenue related to hardware, cloud\n offerings, and professional services to remain substantially\n unchanged. Specifically, under the new standard we expect to\n recognize Windows 10 revenue predominantly at the time of billing\n rather than ratably over the life of the related device. We also\n expect to recognize license revenue at the time of billing rather\n than over the subscription period from certain multi-year\n commercial software subscriptions that include both software\n licenses and Software Assurance. Due to the complexity of certain\n of our commercial license subscription contracts, the actual\n revenue recognition treatment required under the standard will be\n dependent on contract-specific terms, and may vary in some\n instances from recognition at the time of billing.\nWe\n currently believe that the net change in Windows 10 revenue from\n period to period is indicative of the net change in revenue we\n expect from the adoption of the new standard.', '', '•', '', 'Level 1\xa0– inputs are based upon\n unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active\n markets.

['DERIVATIVES', 'NOTE 5 —\n DERIVATIVES\n\nWe use derivative\n instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity\n prices, interest rates, and credit; to enhance investment returns;\n and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Our objectives for\n holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently\n managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as\n possible.\n\nOur derivative programs\n include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge\n accounting treatment. All notional amounts presented below are\n measured in U.S. dollar equivalents.\n\n \xa0\nForeign Currency\n\nCertain forecasted\n transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign\n currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to\n maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge\n positions. Option and forward contracts are used to hedge a portion\n of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the\n future and are designated as cash flow hedging instruments.\n Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British\n pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar. As of June\xa030,\n 2016 and June\xa030, 2015, the total notional amounts of these\n foreign exchange contracts sold were $8.4 billion and $9.8 billion,\n respectively.\n\nForeign currency risks\n related to certain non-U.S. dollar denominated securities are\n hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated\n as fair value hedging instruments. As of June\xa030, 2016 and\n June\xa030, 2015, the total notional amounts of these foreign\n exchange contracts sold were $5.3 billion for both\n periods.\n\nCertain options and\n forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to\n manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on certain balance\n sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency\n exposures.\xa0As of June\xa030, 2016, the total notional\n amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were\n $12.0 billion and $11.7 billion, respectively. As of June\xa030,\n 2015, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange\n contracts purchased and sold were $9.7 billion and $11.0 billion,\n respectively.\nEquity\n\nSecurities held in our\n equity and other investments portfolio are subject to market price\n risk.\xa0Market price risk is managed relative to broad-based\n global and domestic equity indices using certain convertible\n preferred investments, options, futures, and swap contracts not\n designated as hedging instruments. From time to time, to hedge our\n price risk, we may use and designate equity derivatives as hedging\n instruments, including puts, calls, swaps, and forwards.\xa0As of\n June\xa030, 2016, the total notional amounts of equity contracts\n purchased and sold for managing market price risk were $1.3 billion\n and $2.2 billion, respectively, of which $737 million and $986\n million, respectively, were designated as hedging instruments. As\n of June\xa030, 2015, the total notional amounts of equity\n contracts purchased and sold for managing market price risk were\n $2.2 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, of which $1.1 billion\n and $1.4 billion, respectively, were designated as hedging\n instruments.\nInterest Rate\n\nSecurities held in our\n fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks\n based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of our\n fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate\n to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded\n option and futures contracts, and over-the-counter swap and option\n contracts, none of which are designated as hedging instruments. As\n of June\xa030, 2016, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest\n rate contracts purchased and sold were $328 million and $2.4\n billion, respectively. As of June\xa030, 2015, the total notional\n amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were\n $1.0 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively.\n\nIn addition, we use\n “To Be Announced” forward purchase commitments of\n mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed\n securities.\xa0These meet the definition of a derivative\n instrument in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not\n taken at the earliest available delivery date. As of June\xa030,\n 2016 and 2015, the total notional derivative amounts of mortgage\n contracts purchased were $548 million and $812 million,\n respectively.\nCredit\n\nOur fixed-income\n portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade\n securities. We use credit default swap contracts, not designated as\n hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures relative to\n broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. We\n use credit default swaps as they are a low-cost method of managing\n exposure to individual credit risks or groups of credit risks. As\n of June\xa030, 2016, the total notional amounts of credit\n contracts purchased and sold were $440 million and $273 million,\n respectively. As of June\xa030, 2015, the total notional amounts\n of credit contracts purchased and sold were $618 million and $430\n million, respectively.\n\n \xa0\nCommodity\n\nWe use broad-based\n commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and to facilitate\n portfolio diversification. We use swaps, futures, and option\n contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to generate and\n manage exposures to broad-based commodity indices. We use\n derivatives on commodities as they can be low-cost alternatives to\n the purchase and storage of a variety of commodities, including,\n but not limited to, precious metals, energy, and grain. As of\n June\xa030, 2016, the total notional amounts of commodity\n contracts purchased and sold were $631 million and $162 million,\n respectively. As of June\xa030, 2015, the total notional amounts\n of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $882 million and\n $316 million, respectively.\nCredit-Risk-Related Contingent\n Features\n\nCertain of our\n counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain\n provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term\n unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and\n require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. To the\n extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to\n post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to\n over-the-counter derivatives. As of June\xa030, 2016, our\n long-term unsecured debt rating was AAA, and cash investments were\n in excess of $1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral was required\n to be posted.\n\n \xa0\nFair Values of Derivative\n Instruments\n\nThe following table\n presents the fair values of derivative instruments designated as\n hedging instruments (“designated hedge derivatives”)\n and not designated as hedging instruments (“non-designated\n hedge derivatives”). The fair values exclude the impact of\n netting derivative assets and liabilities when a legally\n enforceable master netting agreement exists and fair value\n adjustments related to our own credit

Also included in\n “Other” are business dispositions and transfers between\n business segments due to reorganizations, as applicable. For fiscal\n year 2015, a $5.1 billion goodwill impairment charge was included\n in “Other,” as discussed below. This goodwill\n impairment charge was included in impairment, integration, and\n restructuring expenses on our consolidated income statement, and\n reflected in Corporate and Other in our table of operating income\n (loss) by segment in Note 21 – Segment Information and\n Geographic Data.\nOur\n accumulated goodwill impairment as of both June\xa030, 2016 and\n 2015 was $11.3 billion.\nAs\n discussed in Note 21 – Segment Information and Geographic\n Data, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 our chief\n operating decision maker requested changes in the information that\n he regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and\n assessing performance. This resulted in a change in our operating\n segments and reporting units. We allocated goodwill to our new\n reporting units using a relative fair value approach. In addition,\n we completed an assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for\n all reporting units immediately prior to the reallocation and\n determined that no impairment existed.\n\nGoodwill\n Impairment\nWe test\n goodwill for impairment annually on May\xa01 at the reporting\n unit level, primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology with\n a peer-based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. We\n believe use of a discounted cash flow approach is the most reliable\n indicator of the fair values of the businesses.\nNo\n instances of impairment were identified in our May\xa01, 2016\n test.\nUpon\n completion of the annual testing as of May\xa01, 2015, our\n previous Phone Hardware reporting unit goodwill was determined to\n be impaired. Phone Hardware goodwill is included in the Devices\n reporting unit within More Personal Computing under our current\n segment structure. In the second half of fiscal year 2015, Phone\n Hardware did not meet its sales volume and revenue goals, and the\n mix of units sold had lower margins than planned. These results,\n along with changes in the competitive marketplace and an evaluation\n of business priorities, led to a shift in strategic direction and\n reduced future revenue and profitability expectations for the\n business. As a result of these changes in strategy and\n expectations, we forecasted reductions in unit volume growth rates\n and lower future cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the\n Phone Hardware reporting unit, which resulted in the determination\n that an impairment adjustment was required.\nBecause\n our annual test indicated that Phone Hardware’s carrying\n value exceeded its estimated fair value, a second phase of the\n goodwill impairment test (“Step 2”) was performed\n specific to Phone Hardware. Under Step 2, the fair value of all\n Phone Hardware assets and liabilities were estimated, including\n tangible assets, existing technology, patent agreements, and\n contractual arrangements, for the purpose of deriving an estimate\n of the implied fair value of goodwill. The implied fair value of\n the goodwill was then compared to the recorded goodwill to\n determine the amount of the impairment. Assumptions used in\n measuring the value of these assets and liabilities included the\n discount rates and royalty rates used in valuing the intangible\n assets, and consideration of the market environment in valuing the\n tangible assets.\nNo other\n instances of impairment were identified in our May\xa01, 2015\n test.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '(In millions)', '', 'June\xa030,\n\n2014', '', '', 'Acquisitions', '', '', 'Other', '', '', 'June\xa030,\n\n2015', '', '', 'Acquisitions', '', '', 'Other', '', '', 'June\xa030,\n 2016', '', '', '', 'Productivity and Business\n Processes', '', '$', '6,116', '', '', '$', '376', '', '', '$', '(183', ')', '', '$', '6,309', '', '', '$', '443', '', '', '$', '(74', ')', '', '$', '6,678', '', 'Intelligent Cloud', '', '', '4,631', '', '', '', '291', '', '', '', '(5', ')', '', '', '4,917', '', '', '', '549', '', '', '', '1', '', '', '', '5,467', '', 'More Personal Computing', '', '', '9,380', '', '', '', '1,788', '', '', '', '(5,455', ')', '', '', '5,713', '', '', '', '100', '', '', '', '(86', ')', '', '', '5,727', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Total goodwill', '', '$', '20,127', '', '', '$', '2,455', '', '', '$', '(5,643', ')', '', '$', '16,939', '', '', '$', '1,092', '', '', '$', '(159', ')', '', '$', '17,872', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']

Based on the results of our\n testing, we determined that the carrying value of the intangible\n assets was not recoverable, and an impairment charge was recorded\n to the extent that estimated fair value exceeded carrying value. We\n primarily used the income approach to determine the fair value of\n the intangible assets and determine the amount of\n impairment.\nDuring\n fiscal year 2015, we recorded impairment charges of $2.2 billion\n related to intangible assets in our previous Phone Hardware\n reporting unit. Phone Hardware intangible assets are included in\n the Devices reporting unit under our current segment structure. In\n the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we tested these intangible\n assets for recoverability due to changes in facts and circumstances\n associated with the shift in strategic direction and reduced\n profitability expectations for Phone Hardware. Based on the results\n of our testing, we determined that the carrying value of the\n intangible assets was not recoverable, and an impairment charge was\n recorded to the extent that estimated fair value exceeded carrying\n value. We primarily used a relief from royalty income approach to\n determine the fair value of the intangible assets and determine the\n amount of impairment.\nThese\n intangible assets impairment charges were included in impairment,\n integration, and restructuring expenses on our consolidated income\n statement, and reflected in Corporate and Other in our table of\n operating income (loss) by segment in Note 21 – Segment\n Information and Geographic Data.\n\nWe estimate that we have\n no significant residual value related to our intangible\n assets.\n\n \xa0\n\nThe components of\n intangible assets acquired during the periods presented were as\n follows:\n\n \xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(In millions)\n\xa0\xa0\nAmount\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\n\nWeighted\n\nAverage\xa0Life\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\nAmount\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\n\nWeighted\n\nAverage\xa0Life\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear Ended June\xa030,\n\xa0\xa0\n2016\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n2015\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology-based\n\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n361\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n4\xa0years\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n$\n874\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n5\xa0years\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\nMarketing-related\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n2\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n1\xa0year\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n543\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n8\xa0years\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\nCustomer-related\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n30\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n3\xa0years\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n37\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n4\xa0years\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n\xa0\xa0393\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n4\xa0years\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n$\n\xa0\xa01,454\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n6\xa0years\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\n\nIntangible assets amortization expense was $978 million, $1.3\n billion, and $845 million for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014,\n respectively.

In general, other reconciling items consist\n of interest, U.S. state income taxes, and credits. In fiscal years\n 2016, 2015, and 2014, there were no individually significant other\n reconciling items.\nThe\n decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 compared to\n fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to changes in the mix of our\n income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries,\n including the net impact of revenue deferrals related to sales of\n Windows 10, tax benefits from the adoption of the new accounting\n guidance relating to stock-based compensation, and distributions\n from foreign affiliates. The fiscal year 2015 effective tax rate\n included the tax impact of losses in foreign jurisdictions for\n which we may not realize a tax benefit, primarily as a result of\n impairment and restructuring charges.\nThe\n components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were\n as follows:\n\n \xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(In millions)\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune\xa030,\n\xa0\xa0\n2016\n\xa0\n\xa0\n2015\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeferred Income Tax\n Assets\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock-based compensation\n expense\n\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n809\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n$\n884\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\nOther expense items\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n1,609\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n1,531\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\nRestructuring charges\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n284\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n211\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\nUnearned revenue\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n494\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n520\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\nImpaired investments\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n226\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n257\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\nLoss carryforwards\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n1,703\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n1,158\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\nDepreciation and\n amortization\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n115\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n798\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\nOther revenue items\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n89\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n56\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeferred income tax assets\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n5,329\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n5,415\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\nLess valuation allowance\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n(2,180\n)\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n(2,265\n)\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeferred income tax assets, net of\n valuation allowance\n\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n\xa0\xa0\xa03,149\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n$\n\xa0\xa0\xa03,150\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeferred Income Tax\n Liabilities\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeign earnings\n\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n(1,242\n)\xa0\n\xa0\n$\n(1,280\n)\xa0\n\n\n\nUnrealized gain on investments and\n debt\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n(2,102\n)\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n(2,223\n)\xa0\n\n\n\nDepreciation and\n amortization\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n(1,008\n)\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n(685\n)\xa0\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n(54\n)\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n(29\n)\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeferred income tax\n liabilities\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n(4,406\n)\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n(4,217\n)\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet deferred income tax assets\n (liabilities)\n\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n(1,257\n)\xa0\n\xa0\n$\n(1,067\n)\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReported As\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther long-term assets\xa0(a)\n\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n219\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n$\n228\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\nLong-term deferred income tax\n liabilities\xa0(a)\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n(1,476\n)\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n(1,295\n)\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet deferred income tax assets\n (liabilities)\xa0(a)\n\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n(1,257\n)\xa0\n\xa0\n$\n(1,067\n)\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \xa0\n\n\n(a)\n\nBalances as of June\xa030, 2015 reflect the impact of the\n adoption of the new accounting standard in fiscal year 2016 related\n to balance sheet classification of deferred taxes. See Note 1\n – Accounting Policies for additional details.\n\n\n\nAs of\n June\xa030, 2016, we had net operating loss carryforwards of $8.0\n billion, including $6.3 billion of foreign net operating loss\n carryforwards. The valuation allowance disclosed in the table above\n relates to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards and other\n net deferred tax assets that may not be realized.\n\n \xa0\nDeferred\n income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences\n between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their\n tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in\n effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered.\nAs of\n June\xa030, 2016, we have not provided deferred U.S. income taxes\n or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences of\n approximately $124.0 billion resulting from earnings for certain\n non-U.S. subsidiaries which are permanently reinvested outside the\n U.S. The unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these\n temporary differences was approximately $39.3 billion as of\n June\xa030, 2016.\nIncome\n taxes paid were $3.9 billion, $4.4 billion, and $5.5 billion in\n fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\nTax\n contingencies and other income tax liabilities were $11.8 billion\n and $12.1 billion as of June\xa030, 2016 and 2015, respectively,\n and are included in other long-term liabilities. This decrease\n relates primarily to tax credits available for carryover and a\n partial settlement of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009,\n offset by increases relating to intercompany transfer\n pricing.\n\nUncertain Tax\n Positions\nUnrecognized tax benefits as of June\xa030, 2016, 2015, and\n 2014, were $10.2 billion, $9.6 billion, and $8.7 billion,\n respectively. If recognized, these tax benefits would affect our\n effective tax rates for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, by $8.8\n billion, $7.9 billion, and $7.0 billion, respectively.\nAs of\n June\xa030, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we had accrued interest expense\n related to uncertain tax positions of $1.9 billion, $1.7 billion,\n and $1.5 billion, respectively, net of federal income tax benefits.\n Interest expense on unrecognized tax benefits was $163 million,\n $237 million, and $235 million in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and\n 2014, respectively, and was included in provision for income\n taxes.\nThe\n aggregate changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were\n as follows:\n\n \xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(In millions)\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear Ended June\xa030,\n\xa0\xa0\n2016\n\xa0\n\xa0\n2015\n\xa0\n\xa0\n2014\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalance, beginning of year\n\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n9,599\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n$\n8,714\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n$\n8,648\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\nDecreases related to\n settlements\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n(201\n)\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n(50\n)\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n(583\n)\xa0\n\n\n\nIncreases for tax positions related\n to the current year\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n1,086\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n1,091\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n566\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\nIncreases for tax positions related\n to prior years\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n115\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n94\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n217\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\nDecreases for tax positions related\n to prior years\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n(317\n)\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n(144\n)\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n(95\n)\xa0\n\n\n\nDecreases due to lapsed statutes of\n limitations\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n(118\n)\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n(106\n)\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n(39\n)\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalance, end of year\n\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n\xa0\xa010,164\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n$\n\xa0\xa09,599\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n$\n\xa0\xa08,714\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we\n settled a portion of our IRS audit for tax years 2004 to 2006\n during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, and settled a portion\n of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 during the first\n quarter of fiscal year 2016, we remain under audit for those years.\n In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report\n for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the\n examination. As of June\xa030, 2016, the primary unresolved issue\n relates to transfer pricing, which could have a significant impact\n on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably.\n We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are\n adequate.

The actions associated with the Phone Hardware\n Integration Plan were completed as of June\xa030,\n 2015.\nIn\n connection with the Phone Hardware Integration Plan, we incurred\n total restructuring charges of $1.3 billion, including severance\n expenses and other reorganization costs, primarily associated with\n our facilities consolidation and write-downs of certain assets. All\n restructuring charges incurred under the Phone Hardware Integration\n Plan were recognized in fiscal year 2015.\n\nPhone Hardware\n Restructuring\nIn June\n 2015, management approved a plan to restructure our phone business\n to better focus and align resources (the “Phone Hardware\n Restructuring Plan”), under which we eliminated approximately\n 7,400 positions in fiscal year 2016.\nIn fiscal\n year 2015, we incurred restructuring charges of $780 million under\n the Phone Hardware Restructuring Plan, including severance expenses\n and other reorganization costs. In fiscal year 2016, we reversed\n $21 million of previously estimated restructuring charges related\n to contract termination costs. The actions associated with the\n Phone Hardware Restructuring Plan were substantially complete as of\n June\xa030, 2016, and are expected to be completed by the end of\n calendar year 2016.\n\n2016\n Restructuring\nWe\n periodically evaluate how to best deploy the company’s\n resources. In the fourth quarter of 2016, management approved\n restructuring plans that would result in job eliminations,\n primarily across our smartphone hardware business and global sales.\n In addition to the elimination of 1,850 positions that were\n announced in May 2016, approximately 2,850 roles globally will be\n reduced during the year as an extension of the earlier plan, and\n these actions are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal\n year 2017.\nIn\n connection with the restructuring plans, we incurred restructuring\n charges of $501 million in fiscal year 2016, including severance\n expenses and other reorganization costs. We do not expect to incur\n additional charges for these restructuring plans in subsequent\n years.\nRestructuring charges associated with each of these plans were\n included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses on\n our consolidated income statement, and reflected in Corporate and\n Other in our table of operating income (loss) by segment in Note\n 21– Segment Information and Geographic Data.\nChanges\n in the restructuring liability were as follows:\n\n \xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(In millions)\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\nSeverance\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\nOther\n\xa0(a)\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\nTotal\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestructuring liability as of\n June\xa030, 2015\n\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n588\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n$\n249\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n$\n837\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\nRestructuring charges\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n372\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n129\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n501\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\nReversal of prior year restructuring\n charges\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n0\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n(21\n)\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n(21\n)\xa0\n\n\n\nCash paid\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n(466\n)\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n(112\n)\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n(578\n)\xa0\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n(24\n)\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n(6\n)\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n(30\n)\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestructuring liability as of\n June\xa030, 2016\n\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n\xa0\xa0\xa0470\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n$\n\xa0\xa0\xa0239\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n$\n\xa0\xa0\xa0709\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \xa0\n\n\n(a)\n\n“Other” primarily reflects activities associated\n with the consolidation of our facilities and manufacturing\n operations, including contract termination costs and asset\n write-downs.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '(In millions)', '', '', 'Severance', '', '', '', 'Other', '(a)', '', '', 'Total', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Restructuring liability as of\n June\xa030, 2015', '', '$', '588', '', '', '$', '249', '', '', '$', '837', '', 'Restructuring charges', '', '', '372', '', '', '', '129', '', '', '', '501', '', 'Reversal of prior year restructuring\n charges', '', '', '0', '', '', '', '(21', ')', '', '', '(21', ')', 'Cash paid', '', '', '(466', ')', '', '', '(112', ')', '', '', '(578', ')', 'Other', '', '', '(24', ')', '', '', '(6', ')', '', '', '(30', ')', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Restructuring liability as of\n June\xa030, 2016', '', '$', '470', '', '', '$', '239', '', '', '$', '709', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '(a)', '“Other” primarily reflects activities associated\n with the consolidation of our facilities and manufacturing\n operations, including contract termination costs and asset\n write-downs.']

['CONTINGENCIES', 'NOTE 17\n — CONTINGENCIES\n\nPatent and\n Intellectual Property Claims\n\nIPCom patent\n litigation\nIPCom\n GmbH\xa0& Co. (“IPCom”) is a German company that\n holds a large portfolio of mobile technology-related patents\n spanning about 170 patent families and addressing a broad range of\n cellular technologies. IPCom has asserted 19 of these patents in\n litigation against Nokia and many of the leading cell phone\n companies and operators. In November 2014, Microsoft and IPCom\n entered into a standstill agreement staying all of the pending\n litigation against Microsoft to permit the parties to pursue\n settlement discussions.\n\nInterDigital patent\n litigation\nInterDigital Technology Corporation and InterDigital\n Communications Corporation (collectively, “IDT”) filed\n four patent infringement cases against Nokia in the International\n Trade Commission (“ITC”) and in U.S. District Court for\n the District of Delaware between 2007 and 2013. We have been added\n to these cases as a defendant. IDT has cases pending against other\n defendants based on the same patents because most of the patents at\n issue allegedly relate to 3G and 4G wireless communications\n standards essential functionality. The cases involving us include\n three ITC investigations where IDT sought an order excluding\n importation of 3G and 4G phones into the U.S. and one active case\n in U.S. District Court in Delaware seeking an injunction and\n damages. Each of the ITC matters has been resolved in our favor. In\n September 2015, in an\xa0inter\n partes\xa0review\n the United States Patent Trial and Appeal Board issued a final\n written decision that deemed unpatentable all asserted claims of\n the patent remaining at issue in the Delaware case. IDT has\n appealed this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal\n Circuit. The Delaware case has been stayed pending final completion\n of the\xa0inter\n partes\xa0review\n (including appeals and any subsequent proceedings in the Patent\n Office). We filed an antitrust complaint against IDT in the\n District of Delaware in August 2015 asserting violations of\n Section\xa02 of the Sherman Act, alleging the unlawful\n exploitation of standard essential patents. IDT filed a motion to\n dismiss, which the District Court denied.\n\nEuropean copyright\n levies\nWe\n assumed from Nokia all potential liability due to Nokia’s\n alleged failure to pay “private copying levies” in\n various European countries based upon sale of memory cards and\n mobile phones that incorporate blank memory.\xa0The levies are\n based upon a 2001 European Union (“EU”) Directive\n establishing a right for end users to make copies of copyrighted\n works for personal or private use, but also allowing the collection\n of levies based upon sales of blank media or recording devices to\n compensate copyright holders for private copying.\xa0Various\n collecting societies in EU countries initiated litigation against\n Nokia, stating that Nokia must pay levies not only based upon sales\n of blank memory cards, but also phones that include blank memory\n for data storage on the phones, regardless of actual usage of that\n memory.\xa0The most significant cases against Nokia are pending\n in Germany and Austria, due to both the high volume of sales and\n high levy amounts sought in these countries. In December 2015, the\n industry group BITKOM, of which we are a member, reached a\n settlement with the German collecting society for all claims from\n 2008 forward, leaving litigation only for the period 2004-2007\n pending in Germany. In addition, the industry is engaged in\n settlement negotiations with the Austrian collecting society. We\n have also settled copyright levies litigation in Spain and\n France.\n\nOther patent and\n intellectual property claims\nIn\n addition to these cases, there were 54 other patent infringement\n cases pending against Microsoft as of June\xa030,\n 2016.\n\nAntitrust, Unfair\n Competition, and Overcharge Class Actions\nAntitrust\n and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us\n in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, Canada. All three have\n been certified on behalf of Canadian indirect purchasers who\n acquired licenses for Microsoft operating system software and/or\n productivity application software between 1998 and 2010.\n\n \xa0\nThe trial\n of the British Columbia action commenced in May 2016. The\n plaintiffs are expected to file their case in chief in August 2016,\n setting out claims made, authorities, and evidence in\n support.\xa0A six-month oral hearing is scheduled to commence in\n September 2017, consisting of cross examination on witness\n affidavits. The Ontario and Quebec cases are inactive.\n\nOther Antitrust\n Litigation and Claims\n\nChina State\n Administration for Industry and Commerce\n investigation\nIn 2014,\n Microsoft was informed that China’s State Administration for\n Industry and Commerce (“SAIC”) had begun a formal\n investigation relating to China’s Anti-Monopoly Law, and the\n SAIC conducted onsite inspections of Microsoft offices in Beijing,\n Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu.\xa0SAIC has stated the\n investigation relates to compatibility, bundle sales, file\n verification issues related to Windows and Office software, and\n potentially other issues.\n\nProduct-Related\n Litigation\n\nU.S. cell phone\n litigation\nNokia,\n along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a\n defendant in 19 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for the\n District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio\n emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and\n other adverse health effects. We assumed responsibility for these\n claims as part of the NDS acquisition and have been substituted for\n the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and\n are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining\n 10 cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of\n Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health\n effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that\n operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio\n frequency emission guidelines (“FCC Guidelines”) are\n pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their\n handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were\n manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The\n lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the\n science and testing around emission guidelines.\nIn 2013,\n defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude\n plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general causation on the basis\n of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the court granted in\n part defendants’ motion to exclude plaintiffs’ general\n causation experts. The plaintiffs filed an interlocutory appeal\n challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence,\n which the District of Columbia Court of Appeals agreed to\n hear\xa0en\n banc. Trial court proceedings are stayed pending resolution of\n the appeal.\n\nCanadian cell phone\n class action\nNokia,\n along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a\n defendant in a 2013 class action lawsuit filed in the Supreme Court\n of British Columbia by a purported class of Canadians who have used\n cellular phones for at least 1,600 hours, including a subclass of\n users with brain tumors. Microsoft was served with the complaint in\n June 2014 and has been substituted for the Nokia defendants. The\n litigation is not yet active as several defendants remain to be\n served.\n\nOther\nWe also\n are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from\n time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although\n management currently believes that resolving claims against us,\n individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse\n impact on our consolidated financial statements, these matters are\n subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of\n these matters may change in the future.\nAs of\n June\xa030, 2016, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $521\n million in other current liabilities. While we intend to defend\n these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could\n reach approximately $1.6 billion in aggregate beyond recorded\n amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to\n occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on\n our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the\n effects become reasonably estimable.\n\n \xa0\n\nIndemnifications\nWe\n provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain\n customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made\n by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain\n other matters. Additionally, we have agreed to cover damages\n resulting from breaches of certain security and privacy commitments\n in our cloud business. We evaluate estimated losses for these\n indemnifications, and we consider such factors as the degree of\n probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a\n reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not\n encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and\n have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnifications\n on our consolidated financial statements.']

['Principles of Consolidation', 'Principles of\n Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated\n financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation\n and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have\n been eliminated. Equity investments through which we are able to\n exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee\n and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee’s\n activities are accounted for using the equity method. Investments\n through which we are not able to exercise significant influence\n over the investee and which do not have readily determinable fair\n values are accounted for under the cost method.']
['Segment Information', 'Segment\n Information\nIn June\n 2015, we announced a change in organizational structure to align to\n our strategic direction as a productivity and platform company.\n During the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, our chief operating\n decision maker, who is also our Chief Executive Officer, requested\n changes in the information that he regularly reviews for purposes\n of allocating resources and assessing performance. As a result,\n beginning in fiscal year 2016, we report our financial performance\n based on our new segments described in Note 21 – Segment\n Information and Geographic Data. We have recast certain prior\n period amounts to conform to the way we internally manage and\n monitor segment performance during fiscal year 2016. This change\n primarily impacted Note 10 – Goodwill, Note 15 –\n Unearned Revenue, and Note 21 – Segment Information and\n Geographic Data, with no impact on consolidated net income or cash\n flows.\nRevenue and costs are\n generally directly attributed to our segments. However, due to the\n integrated structure of our business, certain revenue recognized\n and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments.\n Revenue on certain contracts is allocated among the segments based\n on the relative value of the underlying products and services,\n which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices\n when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. Cost\n of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative\n revenue methodology. Operating expenses that are allocated\n primarily include those relating to marketing of products and\n services from which multiple segments benefit, and are generally\n allocated based on relative gross margin.\n\n\xa0\nIn addition, certain costs\n incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that\n benefit our segments are allocated to them. These allocated costs\n include costs of: legal, including settlements, and fines;\n information technology; human resources; finance; excise taxes;\n field selling; shared facilities services; and customer service and\n support. Each allocation is measured differently based on the\n specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated.\n Certain corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segments,\n including impairment, integration, and restructuring\n expenses.\n\xa0\nCorporate and Other operating\n income (loss) includes adjustments to conform our internal\n accounting policies to U.S. GAAP, and impairment, integration, and\n restructuring expenses. Significant internal accounting policies\n that differ from U.S. GAAP relate to revenue\n recognition.\n\xa0\nAssets are not allocated to\n segments for internal reporting presentations. A portion of\n amortization and depreciation is included with various other costs\n in an overhead allocation to each segment; it is impracticable for\n us to separately identify the amount of amortization and\n depreciation by segment that is included in the measure of segment\n profit or loss.']
['Estimates and Assumptions', 'Estimates and\n Assumptions\nPreparing\n financial statements requires management to make estimates and\n assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,\n liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates include:\n loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of, and/or\n potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, for our\n reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible\n and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; allowances\n for product returns; the market value of and volume of demand for\n our inventory; and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates.\n Examples of assumptions include: the elements comprising a software\n arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades or\n enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is\n achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax\n consequences of events that have been recognized on our\n consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining\n when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. Actual\n results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates\n and assumptions.']
['Foreign Currencies', 'Foreign Currencies\n\nAssets and liabilities\n recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate\n on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at\n average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation\n adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other\n comprehensive income (“OCI”).']
['Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue', 'Product Revenue and\n Service and Other Revenue\nService\n revenue exceeded 10% of total revenue for the first time in fiscal\n year 2016. As a result, we have separately disclosed product\n revenue and service and other revenue on our consolidated income\n statements.\nProduct\n revenue includes sales from operating systems; cross-device\n productivity applications; server applications; business solution\n applications; desktop and server management tools; software\n development tools; video games; hardware such as PCs, tablets,\n gaming and entertainment consoles, phones, other intelligent\n devices, and related accessories; and training and certification of\n computer system integrators and developers.\nService\n and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that\n provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content\n such as Office 365, Microsoft Azure (“Azure”),\n Microsoft Dynamics (“Dynamics”) CRM Online, and Xbox\n Live; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other\n revenue also includes sales from online advertising.']
['Revenue Recognition', 'Revenue Recognition\n\nRevenue is recognized\n when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has\n occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is\n probable. Revenue generally is recognized net of allowances for\n returns and any taxes collected from customers and subsequently\n remitted to governmental authorities.\n\nRevenue recognition for\n multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if\n multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted for as\n separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of\n the elements.\n\nMicrosoft enters into\n arrangements that can include various combinations of software,\n services, and hardware. Where elements are delivered over different\n periods of time, and when allowed under U.S. GAAP, revenue is\n allocated to the respective elements based on their relative\n selling prices at the inception of the arrangement, and revenue is\n recognized as each element is delivered. We use a hierarchy to\n determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to\n elements: (i)\xa0vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value\n (“VSOE”), (ii)\xa0third-party evidence, and\n (iii)\xa0best estimate of selling price (“ESP”). For\n software elements, we follow the industry specific software\n guidance which only allows for the use of VSOE in establishing fair\n value. Generally, VSOE is the price charged when the deliverable is\n sold separately or the price established by management for a\n product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will\n not change before introduction into the marketplace. ESPs are\n established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be\n if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. Our\n process for determining ESPs requires judgment and considers\n multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique\n facts and circumstances related to each deliverable.\n\nRevenue for retail\n packaged products, products licensed to original equipment\n manufacturers (“OEMs”), and perpetual licenses under\n certain volume licensing programs generally is recognized as\n products are shipped or made available.\n\nTechnology guarantee\n programs are accounted for as multiple-element arrangements as\n customers receive free or significantly discounted rights to use\n upcoming new versions of a software product if they license\n existing versions of the product during the eligibility period.\n Revenue is allocated between the existing product and the new\n product, and revenue allocated to the new product is deferred until\n that version is delivered. The revenue allocation is based on the\n VSOE of fair value of the products. The VSOE of fair value for\n upcoming new products are based on the price determined by\n management having the relevant authority when the element is not\n yet sold separately, but is expected to be sold in the near future\n at the price set by management.\n\nSoftware updates that\n will be provided free of charge are evaluated on a case-by-case\n basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade\n and create a multiple-element arrangement, which may require\n revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is\n delivered, or if it is determined that implied post-contract\n customer support (“PCS”) is being provided, the\n arrangement is accounted for as a multiple-element arrangement and\n all revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over\n the implied PCS term when the VSOE of fair value does not exist. If\n updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade,\n revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made\n available.\n\nCustomers purchasing a\n Windows 10 license will receive unspecified updates and upgrades\n over the life of their Windows 10 device at no additional cost. As\n these updates and upgrades will not be sold on a stand-alone basis,\n we are unable to establish VSOE of fair value. Accordingly, revenue\n from licenses of Windows 10 is recognized ratably over the\n estimated life of the related device, which ranges between two to\n four years.\n\nCertain volume licensing\n arrangements include a perpetual license for current products\n combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of\n software products, which we have determined are additional software\n products and are therefore accounted for as subscriptions, with\n billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue\n ratably over the coverage period. Arrangements that include\n term-based licenses for current products with the right to use\n unspecified future versions of the software during the coverage\n period, are also accounted for as subscriptions, with revenue\n recognized ratably over the coverage period. Revenue from\n cloud-based services arrangements that allow for the use of a\n hosted software product or service over a contractually determined\n period of time without taking possession of software are accounted\n for as subscriptions with billings recorded as unearned revenue and\n recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period beginning on\n the date the service is made available to customers. Revenue from\n cloud-based services arrangements that are provided on a\n consumption basis (for example, the amount of storage used in a\n particular period) is recognized commensurate with the customer\n utilization of such resources.\n\nSome volume licensing\n arrangements include time-based subscriptions for cloud-based\n services and software offerings that are accounted for as\n subscriptions. These arrangements are considered multiple-element\n arrangements. However, because all elements are accounted for as\n subscriptions and have the same coverage period and delivery\n pattern, they have the same revenue recognition timing.\n\nRevenue related to\n Microsoft Surface (“Surface”) devices, Xbox consoles,\n games published by us, phones, and other hardware components is\n generally recognized when ownership is transferred to the resellers\n or to end customers when selling directly through Microsoft retail\n stores and online marketplaces. A portion of revenue may be\n deferred when these products are combined with software elements,\n and/or services. Revenue related to licensing for games published\n by third parties for use on the Xbox consoles is recognized when\n games are manufactured by the game publishers.\n\nDisplay advertising\n revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed. Search\n advertising revenue is recognized when the ad appears in the search\n results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been\n completed. Consulting services revenue is recognized as services\n are rendered, generally based on the negotiated hourly rate in the\n consulting arrangement and the number of hours worked during the\n period. Consulting revenue for fixed-price services arrangements is\n recognized as services are provided.']
['Cost of Revenue', 'Cost of Revenue\n\nCost of revenue includes:\n manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs\n licensed; operating costs related to product support service\n centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include\n software on PCs sold by OEMs, to drive traffic to our websites, and\n to acquire online advertising space; costs incurred to support and\n maintain Internet-based products and services, including datacenter\n costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation\n adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting\n services; and the amortization of capitalized software development\n costs.

['Investments', 'Investments\n\nWe consider all highly\n liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months\n or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair\n values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In\n general, investments with original maturities of greater than three\n months and remaining maturities of less than one year are\n classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities\n beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their\n highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities\n represent the investment of cash that is available for current\n operations. All cash equivalents and short-term investments are\n classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are\n recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in\n market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are\n reflected in OCI.\n\nEquity and other\n investments classified as long-term include both debt and equity\n instruments. Debt and publicly-traded equity securities are\n classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are\n recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in the\n market value of available-for-sale securities, excluding\n other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in OCI. Common and\n preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more\n than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost or\n using the equity method.\n\nWe lend certain\n fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns.\n These transactions are accounted for as secured borrowings and the\n loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our\n consolidated balance sheets. Cash and/or security interests are\n received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount\n determined based upon the underlying security lent and the\n creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is recorded as an\n asset with a corresponding liability.\n\nInvestments are\n considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to\n be other-than-temporary. Fair value is calculated based on publicly\n available market information or other estimates determined by\n management. We employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis\n that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in\n evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of\n an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other\n factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt\n instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value\n is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and\n ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed-income\n securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the\n security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to\n sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific\n adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business\n outlook for the investee, including industry and sector\n performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing\n cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be\n other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other\n income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is\n established.']
['Derivatives', 'Derivatives\n\nDerivative instruments\n are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at\n fair value.

['Recent Accounting Guidance', 'Recent Accounting\n Guidance\n\nRecently adopted\n accounting guidance\n\nImprovements to\n Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\nIn March\n 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)\n issued a new standard that changes the accounting for certain\n aspects of share-based payments to employees. The new guidance\n requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded in\n the income statement when stock awards vest or are settled. In\n addition, cash flows related to excess tax benefits will no longer\n be separately classified as a financing activity apart from other\n income tax cash flows. The standard also allows us to repurchase\n more of an employee’s vesting shares for tax withholding\n purposes without triggering liability accounting, clarifies that\n all cash payments made to tax authorities on an employee’s\n behalf for withheld shares should be presented as a financing\n activity on our cash flows statement, and provides an accounting\n policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. The new\n standard is effective for us beginning July\xa01, 2017, with\n early adoption permitted.\nWe\n elected to early adopt the new guidance in the third quarter of\n fiscal year 2016 which requires us to reflect any adjustments as of\n July\xa01, 2015, the beginning of the annual period that includes\n the interim period of adoption. The primary impact of adoption was\n the recognition of excess tax benefits in our provision for income\n taxes rather than paid-in capital for all periods in fiscal year\n 2016.\xa0Additional amendments to the accounting for income taxes\n and minimum statutory withholding tax requirements had no impact to\n retained earnings as of July\xa01, 2015, where the cumulative\n effect of these changes are required to be recorded. We have\n elected to continue to estimate forfeitures expected to occur to\n determine the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each\n period.\nWe\n elected to apply the presentation requirements for cash flows\n related to excess tax benefits retrospectively to all periods\n presented which resulted in an increase to both net cash from\n operations and net cash used in financing of $588 million and $271\n million for the years ended June\xa030, 2015 and 2014,\n respectively. The presentation requirements for cash flows related\n to employee taxes paid for withheld shares had no impact to any of\n the periods presented on our consolidated cash flows statements\n since such cash flows have historically been presented as a\n financing activity.\n\n \xa0\nAdoption\n of the new standard resulted in the recognition of excess tax\n benefits in our provision for income taxes rather than paid-in\n capital of $402 million for the year ended June\xa030,\n 2016.\n\nBalance Sheet\n Classification of Deferred Taxes\nIn\n November 2015, the FASB issued guidance that requires companies to\n classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on\n the balance sheet rather than separately disclosing deferred taxes\n as current and noncurrent. This standard is effective for us\n beginning July\xa01, 2017, and can be early adopted and applied\n either prospectively or retrospectively to all periods presented\n upon adoption.\nWe\n elected to early adopt the new guidance in the fourth quarter of\n fiscal year 2016 on a retrospective basis.

For trade and other receivables, loans, and\n other financial instruments, we will be required to use a\n forward-looking expected loss model rather than the incurred loss\n model for recognizing credit losses which reflects losses that are\n probable.

The new standard will be effective for us beginning\n July\xa01, 2020, with early adoption permitted beginning\n July\xa01, 2019. Application of the amendments is through a\n cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the\n effective date. We are currently evaluating the impact of this\n standard on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nLeases\nIn\n February 2016, the FASB issued a new standard related to leases to\n increase transparency and comparability among organizations by\n requiring the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on\n the balance sheet. Most prominent among the amendments is the\n recognition of assets and liabilities by lessees for those leases\n classified as operating leases under previous U.S. GAAP. Under the\n new standard, disclosures are required to meet the objective of\n enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount,\n timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. We will\n be required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the\n earliest period presented using a modified retrospective\n approach.\nThe new\n standard will be effective for us beginning July\xa01, 2019, with\n early adoption permitted. We currently anticipate early adoption of\n the new standard effective July\xa01, 2017 in conjunction with\n our adoption of the new revenue standard.\xa0Our ability to early\n adopt is dependent on system readiness, including software procured\n from third-party providers, and the completion of our analysis of\n information necessary to restate prior period financial\n statements.\n\n \xa0\nWe\n anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our\n consolidated financial statements. While we are continuing to\n assess all potential impacts of the standard, we currently believe\n the most significant impact relates to our accounting for office,\n retail, and datacenter operating leases.\n\nFinancial Instruments\n – Recognition, Measurement, Presentation, and\n Disclosure\nIn\n January 2016, the FASB issued a new standard to amend certain\n aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure\n of financial instruments. Most prominent among the amendments is\n the requirement for changes in the fair value of our equity\n investments, with certain exceptions, to be recognized through net\n income rather than OCI. The new standard will be effective for us\n beginning July\xa01, 2018. The application of the amendments will\n result in a cumulative-effect adjustment to our consolidated\n balance sheets as of the effective date. We are currently\n evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated\n financial statements.\n\nRevenue from Contracts\n with Customers\nIn May\n 2014, the FASB issued a new standard related to revenue\n recognition. Under the new standard, revenue is recognized when a\n customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is\n recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the\n entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.\n In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature,\n amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising\n from contracts with customers. The FASB has recently issued several\n amendments to the standard, including clarification on accounting\n for licenses of intellectual property and identifying performance\n obligations.\nThe\n guidance permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each\n prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or\n retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying\n the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the\n cumulative catch-up transition method). We currently anticipate\n adopting the standard using the full retrospective method to\n restate each prior reporting period presented.\nThe new\n standard will be effective for us beginning July\xa01, 2018, and\n adoption as of the original effective date of July\xa01, 2017 is\n permitted. We currently anticipate early adoption of the new\n standard effective July\xa01, 2017. Our ability to early adopt\n using the full retrospective method is dependent on system\n readiness, including software procured from third-party providers,\n and the completion of our analysis of information necessary to\n restate prior period financial statements.\nWe\n anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our\n consolidated financial statements. While we are continuing to\n assess all potential impacts of the standard, we currently believe\n the most significant impact relates to our accounting for software\n license revenue. We expect revenue related to hardware, cloud\n offerings, and professional services to remain substantially\n unchanged. Specifically, under the new standard we expect to\n recognize Windows 10 revenue predominantly at the time of billing\n rather than ratably over the life of the related device. We also\n expect to recognize license revenue at the time of billing rather\n than over the subscription period from certain multi-year\n commercial software subscriptions that include both software\n licenses and Software Assurance. Due to the complexity of certain\n of our commercial license subscription contracts, the actual\n revenue recognition treatment required under the standard will be\n dependent on contract-specific terms, and may vary in some\n instances from recognition at the time of billing.\nWe\n currently believe that the net change in Windows 10 revenue from\n period to period is indicative of the net change in revenue we\n expect from the adoption of the new standard.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '(In millions)', '', 'June\xa030,\n\n2015', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'As\n adjusted', '', '', '', 'As\n reported', '', '', '', '', 'Balance sheets:', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Current deferred income tax\n assets', '', '$', '0', '', '', '$', '1,915', '', 'Other long-term assets', '', '$', '3,117', '', '', '$', '2,953', '', 'Other current liabilities', '', '$', '6,555', '', '', '$', '6,766', '', 'Long-term deferred income tax\n liabilities', '', '$', '1,295', '', '', '$', '2,835', '', '', '']

['- DefinitionThe carrying value as of the balance sheet date of the assets received as collateral against securities loaned to other broker-dealers. Borrowers of securities generally are required to provide collateral to the lenders of securities, commonly cash but sometimes other securities or standby letters of credit, with a value slightly higher than that of the securities borrowed. In instances where the entity is permitted to sell or re-pledge these securities, the entity reports the fair value of the collateral received and the related obligation to return the collateral as a liability.\n+ ReferencesReference 1: http://www.xbrl.org/2003/role/presentationRef -Publisher FASB -Name Accounting Standards Codification -Topic 860 -SubTopic 10 -Section 05 -Paragraph 17 -URI http://asc.fasb.org/extlink&oid=64836671&loc=d3e93645-111703Reference 2: http://www.xbrl.org/2003/role/presentationRef -Publisher FASB -Name Accounting Standards Codification -Topic 860 -SubTopic 30 -Section 50 -Paragraph 1A -Subparagraph (b)(1) -URI http://asc.fasb.org/extlink&oid=64858031&loc=SL6224234-111729\n+ Details\n\n Name:\nus-gaap_SecuritiesReceivedAsCollateral\n\n\n Namespace Prefix:\nus-gaap_\n\n\n Data Type:\nxbrli:monetaryItemType\n\n\n Balance Type:\ndebit\n\n\n Period Type:\ninstant', 'Name:', 'us-gaap_SecuritiesReceivedAsCollateral', 'Namespace Prefix:', 'us-gaap_', 'Data Type:', 'xbrli:monetaryItemType', 'Balance Type:', 'debit', 'Period Type:', 'instant']
