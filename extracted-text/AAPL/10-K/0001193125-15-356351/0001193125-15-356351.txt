Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. The Greater China segment
includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The Rest of Asia Pacific segment includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Companys other reportable operating segments. Although each reportable operating segment provides similar
hardware and software products and similar services, they are managed separately to better align with the location of the Companys customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. Further
information regarding the Companys reportable operating segments may be found in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 
10-K
 under the subheading Segment Operating Performance, and in Part II,

performance data; simulation tools to locally run, test and debug apps; and tools to simplify the design and development of user interfaces. All developers also have access to extensive technical documentation and sample code.

Markets and Distribution

The Companys customers are
primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers and small and mid-sized
businesses through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. During
2015, the Companys net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 26% and 74%, respectively, of total net sales.

The Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the
hardware and software integration and demonstrate the unique solutions that are available on its products. The Company further believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an effective way to demonstrate the advantages of its
products over those of its competitors and providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers.

To ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company continues to build and improve its
distribution capabilities by expanding the number of its own retail stores worldwide. The Companys retail stores are typically located at high-traffic locations in quality shopping malls and urban shopping districts. By operating its own
stores and locating them in desirable high-traffic locations the Company is better positioned to ensure a high quality customer buying experience and attract new customers. The stores are designed to simplify and enhance the presentation and
marketing of the Companys products and related solutions. The retail stores employ experienced and knowledgeable personnel who provide product advice, service and training and offer a wide selection of third-party hardware, software and other
accessories that complement the Companys products.



Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 4



The Company has also invested in programs to enhance reseller sales by placing high-quality Apple fixtures,
merchandising materials and other resources within selected third-party reseller locations. Through the Apple Premium Reseller Program, certain third-party resellers focus on the Apple platform by providing a high level of product expertise,
integration and support services.

The Company is committed to delivering solutions to help educators teach and students learn. The Company believes
effective integration of technology into classroom instruction can result in higher levels of student achievement and has designed a range of products, services and programs to address the needs of education customers. The Company also supports
mobile learning and real-time distribution of, and access to, education related materials through iTunes U, a platform that allows students and teachers to share and distribute educational media online. The Company sells its products to the
education market through its direct sales force, select third-party resellers and its online and retail stores.

The Company also sells its hardware
and software products to enterprise and government customers in each of its reportable operating segments. The Companys products are deployed in these markets because of their performance, productivity, ease of use and seamless integration
into information technology environments. The Companys products are compatible with thousands of third-party business applications and services, and its tools enable the development and secure deployment of custom applications as well as
remote device administration.

No single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2015, 2014 or 2013.

Competition

The markets for the Companys products and
services are highly competitive and the Company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business. These markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially
increased the capabilities and use of mobile communication and media devices, personal computers and other digital electronic devices. The Companys competitors that sell mobile devices and personal computers based on other operating systems
have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share. The Companys financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide downward pressures on gross
margins. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product features (including security features), relative price and performance, product quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and
accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support and corporate reputation.

The Company is focused on expanding its
market opportunities related to personal computers and mobile communication and media devices. These markets are highly competitive and include many large, well-funded and experienced participants. The Company expects competition in these markets to
intensify significantly as competitors attempt to imitate some of the features of the Companys products and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than
those they currently offer. These markets are characterized by aggressive pricing practices, frequent product introductions, evolving design approaches and technologies, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and
price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.

The Companys digital content services have faced significant competition from other
companies promoting their own digital music and content products and services, including those offering free peer-to-peer music and video services.

The Companys future financial condition and operating results depend on the Companys ability to continue to develop and offer new innovative
products and services in each of the markets in which it competes. The Company believes it offers superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including the hardware (iOS devices, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV), software (iOS, OS X,
watchOS and tvOS), online services and distribution of digital content and applications (Internet Services). Some of the Companys current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and
services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the Companys offerings.

Supply of Components

Although most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources, a number of components are currently
obtained from single or limited sources. In addition, the Company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers. Therefore, many components used by the
Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Companys financial condition and operating
results.



Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 5



The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and the Company often
utilizes custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the
Companys supply of components were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely
affected. The Companys business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from
an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys
requirements.

The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be
able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating
results.

While some Mac computers are manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland, substantially all of the Companys hardware products are currently
manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing
partners are the sole-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the Companys products. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Companys operating results could
be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The Companys purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days.

Research and Development

Because the industries in which the
Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the
marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and to expand the range of its product offerings through R&D, licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and
technology. Total R&D expense was $8.1 billion, $6.0 billion and $4.5 billion in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and
Licenses

The Company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software
and services. The Company has registered or has applied for trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such patents, copyrights, trademarks and service marks is an
important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.

The Company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development and design, and is currently pursuing
thousands of patent applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents around the world. The Company holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services. No
single patent or copyright is solely responsible for protecting the Companys products. The Company believes the duration of its patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products.

Many of the Companys products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek
or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be
obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. Because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company competes, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain
components of the Companys products, processes and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or
other intellectual property rights of third parties.

Foreign and Domestic Operations and Geographic Data

During 2015, the Companys domestic and international net sales accounted for 35% and 65%, respectively, of total net
sales. Information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the subheading Segment Operating Performance, and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 
10-K
 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 11, Segment Information and Geographic Data.



Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 6



While some Mac computers are manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland, substantially all of the Companys
hardware products are currently manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia. The supply and manufacture of a number of components is performed by sole-sourced outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe. Margins on
sales of the Companys products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade
regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties. Information regarding concentration in the available sources of supply of materials and products is set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 
10-K

in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies.

Business Seasonality and Product Introductions

The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal
holiday demand. Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. Product introductions can also impact the Companys net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these
channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction, and often, channel inventory of a particular product declines as the next related major product launch approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and
distributors anticipate a product introduction. However, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the Companys future pattern of product introductions,
future net sales or financial performance.

Warranty

The
Company offers a limited parts and labor warranty on most of its hardware products. The basic warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by the original end-user. The Company also offers a

90-day
 basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the Companys hardware products. In certain jurisdictions, local law requires that manufacturers guarantee their products for a period prescribed
by statute, typically at least two years. In addition, where available, consumers may purchase APP or AC+, which extends service coverage on many of the Companys hardware products.

Backlog

In the Companys experience, the actual amount of
product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects. In particular, backlog often increases immediately following new product introductions as customers anticipate shortages. Backlog is often
reduced once customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Companys ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.

Employees

As of September 26, 2015, the Company had
approximately 110,000 full-time equivalent employees.

The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These
risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this Form 10-K. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.

The business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown,
including but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the Companys actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial
condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition, operating results and stock price.

Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Companys financial condition and operating results, past financial
performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.

Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company.

The Companys operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Uncertainty about global and regional
economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, higher unemployment, financial market volatility, government austerity programs, negative financial news, declines in income or
asset values and/or other factors. These worldwide and regional economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for the Companys products and services. Demand also could differ materially from the Companys expectations
as a result of currency fluctuations because the Company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the U.S. to correspond with the effect of a strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Other factors that could influence worldwide or
regional demand include changes in fuel and other energy costs, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, unemployment, labor and healthcare costs, access to credit, consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer
spending behavior. These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the Companys products and services.

In the
event of financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets, additional consolidation of the financial services industry, or significant financial service institution failures, there could be tightening in the
credit markets, low liquidity and extreme volatility in fixed income, credit, currency and equity markets. This could have a number of effects on the Companys business, including the insolvency or financial instability of
outsourcing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development and/or manufacture products resulting in product delays; inability of customers, including channel partners, to obtain credit to finance purchases
of the Companys products; failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; and restrictions on the Companys ability to issue new debt. Other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations
depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments; impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments; changes in interest rates; increases or
decreases in cash balances; volatility in foreign exchange rates; and changes in fair value of derivative instruments. Increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual
amounts realized in the future on the Companys financial instruments differing significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them.

Global markets for the Companys products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the
Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.

The Companys products and services compete in highly competitive global
markets characterized by aggressive price cutting and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance
characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers.

The
Companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it
designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. The Company
currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and/or has applied to register numerous patents, trademarks and service marks. In contrast, many of the Companys competitors seek to compete primarily through
aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and emulating the Companys products and infringing on its intellectual property. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with
attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Companys intellectual property, the Companys ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected.



Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 8



The Company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the iOS mobile operating system
and also markets related third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established
hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships; and the Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone market. Additionally, the Company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and
attempt to imitate the Companys product features and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company competes with
business models that include content provided to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate ways to obtain third-party digital content and applications. Some of the Companys competitors have greater experience, product breadth
and distribution channels than the Company. Because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and/or experience and a lower cost structure, they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a
loss. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Companys approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. The
Companys financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Companys ability to continually improve iOS and iOS devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages.

The Company is the only authorized maker of hardware using OS X, which has a minority market share in the personal computer market. This market has been
contracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems, most notably Windows. In the market for personal computers and accessories, the Company faces a significant number of competitors, many of which have broader product
lines, lower priced products and a larger installed customer base. Historically, consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors. Price competition has been particularly intense as competitors selling Windows-based personal computers
have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. An increasing number of internet-enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the
Companys existing products. The Companys financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the Mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages.

There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.

To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions.

Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new
products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products. The success of new product
introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful product development, market acceptance, the Companys ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the
availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to
meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and
transitions.

The Company depends on the performance of distributors, carriers and other resellers.

The Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, national and regional retailers and value-added resellers, many of
whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells its products and third-party products in most of its major markets directly to education, enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid-sized
businesses through its online and retail stores.

Carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone typically subsidize users purchases of
the device. There is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Companys agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with new carriers.



Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 9



Many resellers have narrow operating margins and have been adversely affected in the past by weak economic
conditions. Some resellers have perceived the expansion of the Companys direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the Companys products. Such a perception could discourage resellers from
investing resources in the distribution and sale of the Companys products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including
staffing selected resellers stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue. The
financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Companys products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Companys products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering
and marketing of the Companys products.

The Company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase
commitment cancellation risk.

The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed
anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company also reviews its long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities
and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which
the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its provisions related to inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate, no assurance can be
given that the Company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.

The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Consistent with industry
practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts and open orders, in each case based on projected demand. Where appropriate, the purchases are applied to inventory component
prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier. Purchase commitments typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days. Because the Companys markets are volatile,
competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.

Future operating results depend upon the Companys ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities.

Because the Company currently obtains components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many
components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components,
there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. A number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the
supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Companys ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Companys suppliers, described
in 
Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company
 above, also could affect the Companys ability to obtain components
. 
Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks
of supply shortages and price increases.

The Company and other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal
computers also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. The Company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries. The Companys new
products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased.
Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected for any number of reasons, including if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet
the Companys requirements. The supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained, or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the Company.



Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 10



The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by
outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.

Substantially all of the Companys manufacturing is performed in
whole or in part by a few outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the Companys
direct control over production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the Companys flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although
arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect
or warranty liability. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur.

The Company relies on sole-sourced outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many critical components, and on
outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Companys hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the Companys cost or supply of components
or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system
failures, commercial disputes, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues.

The Company has
invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the
supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the net realizable value of
these assets could be negatively impacted.

The Companys products and services may experience quality problems from time to time
that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to the Companys reputation.

The Company sells complex hardware and
software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those sold by the Company, often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the
softwares intended operation. The Companys online services may from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns, or errors. Defects may also occur in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. There can be
no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware, software and services it sells. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the Companys reputation.

The Company relies on access to third-party digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms
or at all.

The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content. This includes the right to sell currently
available music, movies, TV shows and books. The licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at
all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their
content in the future. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Companys access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable
prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. Failure to obtain the right to make available third-party digital content, or to make available such content on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material
adverse impact on the Companys financial condition and operating results.

Some third-party digital content providers require the Company to
provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such
solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. In addition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the Company to license its digital rights management, which could lessen the protection of
content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the Companys content providers.



Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 11



The Companys future performance depends in part on support from 
third-party
 software developers.

The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware
products depend in part on the availability of 
third-party
 software applications and services. There is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and
services for the Companys products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Companys products, customers may choose not to buy the Companys products.

With respect to its Mac products, the Company believes the availability of 
third-party
 software applications and
services depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software for the Companys products compared to Windows-based products. This analysis may be based
on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of Mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services. If the Companys minority
share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the Macs prospects, developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Companys Mac products and more inclined to devote their resources to
developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows market.

With respect to iOS devices, the Company relies on the continued availability and
development of compelling and innovative software applications, which are distributed through a single distribution channel, the App Store. iOS devices are subject to rapid technological change, and, if third-party developers are unable to or choose
not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers. As with applications for the Companys Mac products, the availability and development of these
applications also depend on developers perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining or upgrading software for the Companys iOS devices rather than its competitors platforms, such as Android. If
developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Companys iOS devices may suffer.

The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable
terms or at all.

Many of the Companys products include third-party intellectual property, which requires licenses from those third
parties. Based on past experience and industry practice, the Company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms. There is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all.
Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude the Company from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the
Companys financial condition and operating results.

The Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings,
such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights.

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that
have not yet been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business, and additional claims may arise in the future.

For
example, technology companies, including many of the Companys competitors, frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent holding companies
seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. As the Company has grown, the intellectual property rights claims against it have increased and may continue to increase. In particular, the Companys cellular enabled products
compete with products from mobile communication and media device companies that hold significant patent portfolios, and the number of patent claims against the Company has significantly increased. The Company is vigorously defending
infringement actions in courts in a number of U.S. jurisdictions and before the U.S. International Trade Commission, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial
damages.

Regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights, or the merits of any claims by potential or
actual litigants, the Company may have to engage in protracted litigation. If the Company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights, regardless of whether it can develop non-infringing technology, it may be
required to pay substantial damages or royalties to a third-party, or it may be subject to a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the Company from marketing or selling certain products.

In certain cases, the Company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements, although no assurance can be given that such licenses
can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These licenses may also significantly increase the Companys operating expenses.



Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 12



Regardless of the merit of particular claims, litigation may be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the
Companys operations and distracting to management. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation.

In managements opinion, there is not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess
of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain.

Although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a
reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations, the Companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome could result in significant
compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.

The Company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide, changes to which could increase the Companys costs and individually or in
the aggregate adversely affect the Companys business.

The Company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and
international operations in a number of areas. These U.S. and foreign laws and regulations affect the Companys activities including, but not limited to, in areas of labor, advertising, digital content, consumer protection, real estate,
billing, e-commerce, promotions, quality of services, telecommunications, mobile communications and media, television, intellectual property ownership and infringement, tax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls
and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, anti-competition, environmental, health and safety.

By way of example, laws and
regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the Company operates are extensive and subject to change. Such changes could include, among others, restrictions on the production, manufacture,
distribution and use of devices, locking devices to a carriers network, or mandating the use of devices on more than one carriers network. These devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization
bodies, as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks. These certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications, or delays in product shipment
dates, or could preclude the Company from selling certain products.

Compliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous
and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in
their interpretation, could individually or in the aggregate make the Companys products and services less attractive to the Companys customers, delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions, or cause the Company to change
or limit its business practices. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the Companys employees, contractors, or agents will not
violate such laws and regulations or the Companys policies and procedures.

The Companys business is subject to the risks of
international operations.

The Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations. Compliance
with applicable U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, such as import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, environmental laws, labor laws
and anti-competition regulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Although the Company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations, a violation by the Companys employees,
contractors, or agents could nevertheless occur. Violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the Companys brand, international growth efforts and business.

The Company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including, but not limited to, economic and
labor conditions, increased duties, taxes and other costs and political instability. Margins on sales of the Companys products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be
materially adversely affected by international trade regulations, including duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties. The Company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international
markets. There can be no assurance the Company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.



Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 13



The Companys retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial
investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.

The Companys retail stores have required
substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to
serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the
Companys more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Companys retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease
termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs.

Many factors unique to retail operations, some of which
are beyond the Companys control, pose risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity, as well as the Companys
inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation, the Companys failure to manage relationships with its existing retail partners, more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the U.S., costs
associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory, and the Companys inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.

Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Companys ongoing business and present risks not originally
contemplated.

The Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve
significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the Companys due
diligence. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful.

The Companys business and reputation may be
impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions.

The Company may be subject to information technology system
failures and network disruptions. These may be caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions.
System redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Companys disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions could, among other things, prevent access to the Companys online
stores and services, preclude retail store transactions, compromise Company or customer data, and result in delayed or cancelled orders. System failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products, delivery of online
services, transactions processing and financial reporting.

There may be breaches of the Companys information technology systems
that materially damage business partner and customer relationships, curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services, or subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.

The Companys business requires it to use and store customer, employee and business partner personally identifiable information
(PII). This may include, among other information, names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, contact preferences, tax identification numbers and payment account information. Although malicious attacks to gain access to PII affect
many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the amount of PII it manages.

The Company requires user names and passwords in order to access its information technology systems. The Company also uses encryption and authentication
technologies designed to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to Company data or accounts. As with all companies, these security measures are subject to third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty
password management, or other irregularities. For example, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access the
Companys information technology systems. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company monitors accounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which may result in the delay or loss of
customer orders.



Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 14



The Company devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and other security measures
to protect its systems and data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute security. To the extent the Company was to experience a breach of its systems and was unable to protect sensitive data, such a breach could materially damage
business partner and customer relationships, and curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services. Moreover, if a computer security breach affects the Companys systems or results in the unauthorized release of PII,
the Companys reputation and brand could be materially damaged, use of the Companys products and services could decrease, and the Company could be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. While the Company maintains
insurance coverage that, subject to policy terms and conditions and subject to a significant self-insured retention, is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types
of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk.

The Companys business is subject to a variety of U.S.
and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.

The Company is subject to federal, state and
international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of PII. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between the Company and its subsidiaries, and
among the Company, its subsidiaries and other parties with which the Company has commercial relations. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue
to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices.
Noncompliance could result in penalties or significant legal liability.

The Companys privacy policy, which includes related practices
concerning the use and disclosure of data, is posted on its website. Any failure by the Company, its suppliers or other parties with whom the Company does business to comply with its posted privacy policy or with other federal, state or
international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others.

The Company is also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors. Under these rules and
obligations, if information is compromised, the Company could be liable to payment card issuers for associated expenses and penalties. In addition, if the Company fails to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no customer
information is compromised, the Company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs.

The Companys success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel.

Much of the Companys future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer,
executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Companys key personnel are
located.

The Companys business may be impacted by political events, war, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters and
other business interruptions.

War, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues and other business interruptions have caused
and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its suppliers, logistics providers, manufacturing vendors and customers, including channel partners.
The Companys business operations are subject to interruption by, among others, natural disasters, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile
acts, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond its control. Such events could decrease demand for the Companys products, make it difficult or impossible for the Company to make and deliver products to its customers,
including channel partners, or to receive components from its suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in the Companys supply chain. Should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the Company could be adversely affected
by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the
Companys manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. The majority of the Companys R&D activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems and other critical business operations, including certain component
suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters. In the event of a natural disaster, the Company could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time and experience significant
expenditures in order to resume operations.

The Company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate.

The Companys profit margins vary across its products and distribution channels. The Companys software, accessories, and service and support
contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the Companys other products. Gross margins on the Companys hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and
configuration changes, and component, warranty, and other cost fluctuations. The Companys direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners. In addition, the Companys gross
margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic or channel mix, component cost increases, the strengthening U.S. dollar, price competition,
or the introduction of new products, including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing.

The Company has typically
experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. Further, the
Company generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter, such as
lower-than-anticipated demand for the Companys products, issues with new product introductions, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the Companys logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.

The Companys stock price is subject to volatility.

The Companys stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the
Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance. Price
volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stocks price at a given point in time. The Company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth
and profitability. The Company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are
subject to declaration by the Companys Board of Directors, and the Companys share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth,
profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.

The Companys financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus local
currencies.

The Companys primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar-denominated sales
and operating expenses worldwide. Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Companys foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise
international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Companys products. Margins on sales of the Companys products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be
materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollars strengthening, or at all, which
would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the Companys foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Companys
foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies
may also increase the Companys cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.

The Company
uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any, or more than a portion, of the
adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.

The Company
is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio.

Given the global nature of its business, the
Company has both domestic and international investments. Credit ratings and pricing of the Companys investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, sovereign risk or
other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in a significant realized loss.



Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 16



The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade
receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.

The Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. The Company also
sells its products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Companys outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party financing
arrangements or credit insurance. The Companys exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured
vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with
long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 26, 2015, a significant portion of the Companys trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers, and its vendor non-trade
receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor
non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.

The Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to
additional tax liabilities.

The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number
of the Companys subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Companys effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of
earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland. For example, in June 2014, the European
Commission opened a formal investigation of Ireland to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities with regard to the corporate income tax to be paid by two of the Companys Irish subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid.
If the European Commission were to conclude against Ireland, it could require Ireland to recover from the Company past taxes covering a period of up to 10 years reflective of the disallowed state aid, and such amount could be material.

The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and
governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If
the Companys effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Companys taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Companys financial
condition, operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.

None.



The Companys headquarters are located in Cupertino, California. As of
September 26, 2015, the Company owned or leased 25.6 million square feet of building space, primarily in the U.S. The Company also owned or leased building space in various locations, including throughout Europe, China, Singapore and
Japan. Of the total owned or leased building space 18.5 million square feet was leased building space, which includes approximately 5.3 million square feet related to retail store space. Additionally, the Company owns a total of 1,757
acres of land in various locations.

As of September 26, 2015, the Company owned a manufacturing facility in Cork, Ireland that also housed a
customer support call center; facilities in Elk Grove, California that included warehousing and distribution operations and a customer support call center; and a facility in Mesa, Arizona. The Company also owned land in Austin, Texas where it is
expanding its existing office space and customer support call center. In addition, the Company owned facilities and land for R&D and corporate functions in San Jose, California and Cupertino, California, including land that is being developed
for the Companys second corporate campus. The Company also owned data centers in Newark, California; Maiden, North Carolina; Prineville, Oregon; and Reno, Nevada. Outside the U.S., the Company owned additional facilities for various purposes.

The Company believes its existing facilities and equipment, which are used by all operating segments, are in good operating condition and are
suitable for the conduct of its business. The Company has invested in internal capacity and strategic relationships with outside manufacturing vendors and continues to make investments in capital equipment as needed to meet anticipated demand for
its products.



The Company is subject to the legal proceedings and claims discussed below as
well as certain other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred
a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. However, the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company is subject to significant
uncertainty. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of managements
expectations, the Companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. See the risk factor 
The Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings, such as
being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights
 in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading Risk Factors. The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2015 that did not
individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Companys financial condition or operating results.

Apple eBooks
Antitrust Litigation (United States of America v. Apple Inc., et al.)

On April 11, 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a civil
antitrust action against the Company and five major book publishers in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging an unreasonable restraint of interstate trade and commerce in violation of §1 of the Sherman Act and
seeking, among other things, injunctive relief, the District Courts declaration that the Companys agency agreements with the publishers are null and void and/or the District Courts reformation of such agreements. On July 10,
2013, the District Court found, following a bench trial, that the Company conspired to restrain trade in violation of §1 of the Sherman Act and relevant state statutes to the extent those laws are congruent with §1 of the Sherman
Act. The District Court entered a permanent injunction, which took effect on October 6, 2013 and will be in effect for five years unless the judgment is overturned on appeal. The Company has taken the necessary steps to comply with the
terms of the District Courts order, including renegotiating agreements with the five major eBook publishers, updating its antitrust training program and completing a two-year monitorship with a court-appointed antitrust compliance monitor,
whose appointment the District Court ended in October 2015. The Company appealed the District Courts decision. Pursuant to a settlement agreement reached in June 2014, any damages the Company may be obligated to pay will be determined by the
outcome of the final adjudication following exhaustion of all appeals.

In 2012, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $10 billion of the Companys common stock beginning in 2013. The
Companys Board of Directors increased the authorization to repurchase the Companys common stock to $60 billion in April 2013, to $90 billion in April 2014 and to $140 billion in April 2015. As of September 26, 2015, $104 billion of
the $140 billion had been utilized. The remaining $36 billion in the table represents the amount available to repurchase shares under the authorized repurchase program as of September 26, 2015. The Companys share repurchase program
does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act.



In May 2015, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase arrangement (ASR) to purchase up to $6.0 billion of the Companys
common stock. In July 2015, the purchase period for this ASR ended and an additional 10.0 million shares were delivered and retired. In total, 48.3 million net shares were delivered under this ASR at an average repurchase price of $124.24.

 All information presented herein is based on the Companys fiscal calendar. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the
Companys fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the Company and Apple as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its

Overview and Highlights

The Company designs, manufactures and
markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers and portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, accessories, networking solutions and third-party digital content and applications. The Company
sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores and direct sales force, as well as through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of
third-party Apple compatible products, including application software and various accessories through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers.

Fiscal 2015 Highlights

Net sales rose 28% or $50.9
billion during 2015 compared to 2014, driven by a 52% year-over-year increase in iPhone
®
 net sales. iPhone net sales and unit sales in 2015 increased in all of the Companys reportable
operating segments. The Company also experienced year-over-year net sales increases in Mac
®
, Services and Other Products. Apple Watch
®
,
which launched during the third quarter of 2015, accounted for more than 100% of the year-over-year growth in net sales of Other Products. Net sales growth during 2015 was partially offset by the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies
relative to the U.S. dollar and lower iPad
®
 net sales. Total net sales increased in each of the Companys reportable operating segments, with particularly strong growth in Greater China
where year-over-year net sales increased 84%.

In April 2015, the Company announced a significant increase to its capital return program by raising
the expected total size of the program to $200 billion through March 2017. This included increasing its share repurchase authorization to $140 billion and raising its quarterly dividend to $0.52 per share beginning in May 2015. During 2015, the
Company spent $36.0 billion to repurchase shares of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $11.6 billion. Additionally, the Company issued $14.5 billion of U.S. dollar-denominated,


4.8 billion of euro-denominated, SFr1.3 billion of Swiss franc-denominated, £1.3 billion of British pound-denominated, A$2.3 billion of Australian dollar-denominated and ¥250.0 billion
of Japanese yen-denominated term debt during 2015.

Fiscal 2014 Highlights

Net sales rose 7% or $11.9 billion during 2014 compared to 2013. This was driven by increases in net sales of iPhone, Mac and Services. Net sales and unit
sales increased for iPhone primarily due to the successful introduction of iPhone 5s and 5c in the latter half of calendar year 2013, the successful launch of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014, and expanded distribution.
Mac net sales and unit sales increased primarily due to strong demand for MacBook Air
®
 and MacBook Pro
®
 which were updated in 2014 with
faster processors and offered at lower prices. Net sales of Services grew primarily due to increased revenue from sales through the App Store
®
, AppleCare
®
 and licensing. Growth in these areas was partially offset by the year-over-year decline in net sales for iPad due to lower unit sales in many markets, and a decline in net sales of Other
Products. All of the Companys operating segments other than the Rest of Asia Pacific segment experienced increased net sales in 2014, with growth being strongest in the Greater China and Japan operating segments.

During 2014, the Company completed various business acquisitions, including the acquisitions of Beats Music, LLC, which offers a subscription streaming
music service, and Beats Electronics, LLC, which makes Beats
®
 headphones, speakers and audio software.



Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 23



In April 2014, the Company increased its share repurchase authorization to $90 billion and the quarterly
dividend was raised to $0.47 per common share, resulting in an overall increase in its capital return program from $100 billion to over $130 billion. During 2014, the Company utilized $45 billion to repurchase its common stock and paid dividends and
dividend equivalents of $11.1 billion. The Company also issued $12.0 billion of long-term debt during 2014, with varying maturities through 2044, and launched a commercial paper program, with $6.3 billion outstanding as of September 27, 2014.

Product Performance

iPhone

The following table presents iPhone net sales and unit sales information for 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in millions and units in thousands):



Net sales

Percentage of total net sales

Unit sales

The year-over-year growth in iPhone net sales and unit sales during 2015 primarily resulted from strong demand for iPhone
6 and 6 Plus during 2015. Overall average selling prices (ASPs) for iPhone increased by 11% during 2015 compared to 2014, due primarily to the introduction of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in September 2014, partially offset by the effect of
weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.

The year-over-year growth in iPhone net sales and unit sales in 2014 resulted
primarily from the successful introduction of new iPhones in the latter half of calendar year 2013, the successful launch of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus beginning in September 2014, and expanded distribution. iPhone unit sales grew in all of the
Companys operating segments, while iPhone net sales grew in all segments except Rest of Asia Pacific. Overall ASPs for iPhone were relatively flat in 2014 compared to 2013, with growth in ASPs in the Americas segment being offset by a decline
in ASPs in the Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific segments.

iPad

The following table presents iPad net sales and unit sales information for 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in millions and units in thousands):



Net sales

Percentage of total net sales

Unit sales

Net sales and unit sales for iPad declined during 2015 compared to 2014. The Company believes the decline in iPad sales
is due in part to a longer repurchase cycle for iPads and some level of cannibalization from the Companys other products. iPad ASPs declined by 5% during 2015 compared to 2014, primarily as a result of the effect of weakness in most foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and a shift in mix to lower-priced iPads.

Net sales and unit sales for iPad declined in 2014 compared to
2013. iPad net sales and unit sales grew in the Greater China and Japan segments but this growth was more than offset by a decline in all other segments. Overall iPad ASPs were relatively flat in 2014 compared to 2013 with a shift in mix to
higher-priced iPads being offset by the October 2013 price reduction of iPad mini. ASPs increased in the Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific segments but were slightly down in other segments.

Mac

The following table presents Mac net sales and unit sales
information for 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in millions and units in thousands):



Net sales

Percentage of total net sales

Unit sales

The year-over-year growth in Mac net sales and unit sales during 2015 was driven by strong demand for Mac portables. Mac
ASPs declined 3% during 2015 compared to 2014 largely due to the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.

The
year-over-year growth in Mac net sales and unit sales for 2014 was primarily driven by increased sales of MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and Mac Pro. Mac net sales and unit sales increased in all of the Companys operating segments. Mac ASPs
decreased during 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to price reductions on certain Mac models and a shift in mix towards Mac portable systems.

Services

The following table
presents net sales information of Services for 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in millions):



Net sales

Percentage of total net sales

The increase in net sales of Services during 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to growth from Internet Services and
licensing. The App Store, included within Internet Services, generated strong year-over-year net sales growth of 29%.

The increase in net sales of
Services in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to growth in net sales from Internet Services, AppleCare and licensing. Internet Services generated a total of $10.2 billion in net sales during 2014 compared to $9.3 billion during 2013. Growth in
net sales from Internet Services was driven by increases in revenue from app sales reflecting continued growth in the installed base of iOS devices and the expanded offerings of iOS apps and related in-app purchases. This was partially offset by a
decline in sales of digital music.

Segment Operating Performance

The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Companys reportable operating segments consist of the Americas, Europe,
Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. The Greater China segment includes China, Hong
Kong and Taiwan. The Rest of Asia Pacific segment includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Companys other reportable operating segments. Although, each reportable operating segment provides similar hardware and software
products and similar services, they are managed separately to better align with the location of the Companys customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. Further information regarding the
Companys reportable operating segments can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 11, Segment Information and Geographic Data.

Americas

The following table presents Americas net sales
information for 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in millions):



Net sales

Percentage of total net sales

The year-over-year growth in Americas net sales during 2015 was driven primarily by growth in net sales and unit sales of
iPhone, partially offset by a decline in net sales and unit sales of iPad.

The growth in the Americas segment in 2014 was due to increased net sales
of iPhone, Mac and Services that was partially offset by a decline in net sales of iPad and Other Products and weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar compared to 2013. iPhone growth resulted primarily from the successful
introduction of iPhone 5s and 5c in September 2013 and the successful launch of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in September 2014. Mac growth was driven primarily by increased net sales and unit sales of MacBook Air and Mac Pro.

Europe

The following table presents Europe net sales
information for 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in millions):



Net sales

Percentage of total net sales

The year-over-year increase in Europe net sales during 2015 was driven primarily by growth in net sales and unit sales of
iPhone, partially offset by the effect of weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and a decline in net sales and unit sales of iPad.

The growth in the Europe segment in 2014 was due to increased net sales of iPhone, Mac and Services, as well as strength in European currencies relative
to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a decline in net sales of iPad. iPhone growth resulted primarily from the successful introduction of iPhone 5s and 5c in the second half of calendar 2013 and the successful launch of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in
over 20 countries in Europe in September 2014. Mac growth was driven primarily by increased net sales and unit sales of MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and Mac Pro.

Greater China

The
following table presents Greater China net sales information for 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in millions):



Net sales

Percentage of total net sales

Greater China experienced strong year-over-year increases in net sales during 2015 driven primarily by iPhone sales.

The Greater China segment experienced year-over-year growth in net sales in 2014 that was significantly higher than the growth rate for the Company
overall. Greater China growth was driven by higher unit sales and net sales of all major product categories, in addition to higher net sales of Services. Growth in net sales and unit sales of iPhone was especially strong, driven by the successful
launch of iPhone 5s and 5c in Mainland China and Hong Kong in September 2013, the successful launch of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in Hong Kong in September 2014, increased demand for the Companys entry-priced iPhones and the addition of a significant
new carrier in the second quarter of 2014.

Japan

The
following table presents Japan net sales information for 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in millions):



Net sales

Percentage of total net sales

The year-over-year increase in Japan net sales during 2015 was driven primarily by growth in Services largely associated
with strong App Store sales, partially offset by the effect of weakness in the Japanese yen relative to the U.S. dollar.

In 2014 the Japan segment
generated year-over-year increases in net sales and unit sales of every major product category and experienced growth in net sales of Services. The year-over-year growth in iPhone was driven by the successful launch of iPhone 5s and 5c in September
2013, the successful launch of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in September 2014, increased demand for the Companys entry-priced iPhones and the addition of a significant new carrier in the fourth quarter of 2013. These positive factors were partially
offset by weakness in the Japanese Yen relative to the U.S. dollar.

Rest of Asia Pacific

The following table presents Rest of Asia Pacific net sales information for 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in millions):



Net sales

Percentage of total net sales

The year-over-year increase in Rest of Asia Pacific net sales during 2015 primarily reflects strong growth in net sales
and unit sales of iPhone, partially offset by the effect of weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and a decline in net sales and unit sales of iPad.

Net sales in the Rest of Asia Pacific segment declined in 2014 compared to 2013 due to year-over-year reductions in net sales in all major product
categories except Mac and reductions in unit sales of iPad. Net sales in 2014 were also negatively affected by the weakness in several foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Australian dollar.

Gross Margin

Gross margin for 2015, 2014 and 2013 is as follows (dollars in millions):



Net sales

Cost of sales













Gross margin













Gross margin percentage

The year-over-year increase in the gross margin percentage in 2015 was driven primarily by a favorable shift in mix to
products with higher margins and, to a lesser extent, by improved leverage on fixed costs from higher net sales. These positive factors were partially offset primarily by higher product cost structures and, to a lesser extent, by the effect of
weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.

The year-over-year increase in the gross margin percentage in 2014 was driven by
multiple factors including lower commodity costs, a favorable shift in mix to products with higher margins and improved leverage on fixed costs from higher net sales, which was partially offset by the weakness in several foreign currencies relative
to the U.S. dollar, price reductions on select products and higher cost structures on certain new products.

The Company anticipates gross margin
during the first quarter of 2016 to be between 39% and 40%. The foregoing statement regarding the Companys expected gross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2016 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. The
Companys future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading Risk Factors and those described in this paragraph. In
general, the Company believes gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product
transitions, potential increases in the cost of components, and potential strengthening of the U.S. dollar, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the Companys sales mix towards
products with lower gross margins. In response to competitive pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. Gross margins could also be affected by the Companys
ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. Due to the Companys significant international operations, its financial condition and operating results, including gross
margins, could be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.

Research and Development

The
year-over-year growth in R&D expense in 2015 and 2014 was driven primarily by an increase in headcount and related expenses, including share-based compensation costs, and material costs to support expanded R&D activities. The Company
continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and updated products that are central to the Companys
core business strategy.

Selling, General and Administrative

The year-over-year growth in selling, general and administrative expense in 2015 and 2014 was primarily due to increased headcount and related expenses,
including share-based compensation costs, and higher spending on marketing and advertising.

Total other income/(expense), net













The increase in other income/(expense), net during 2015 compared to 2014 was due primarily to higher interest income,
partially offset by higher expenses associated with foreign exchange activity and higher interest expense on debt. The decrease in other income and expense during 2014 compared to 2013 was due primarily to higher interest expense on debt and higher
expenses associated with foreign exchange rate movements, partially offset by lower premium expenses on foreign exchange contracts and higher interest income. The weighted-average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities was 1.49%, 1.11% and 1.03% in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Provision for Income Taxes

Provision for income taxes and effective tax rates for 2015, 2014 and 2013 are as follows (dollars in millions):



Provision for income taxes

Effective tax rate

The Companys effective tax rates for 2015, 2014 and 2013 differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35%
due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings, a substantial portion of which was generated by subsidiaries organized in Ireland, for which no U.S. taxes are provided when such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside
the U.S. The higher effective tax rate during 2015 compared to 2014 was due primarily to higher foreign taxes. The effective tax rate in 2014 compared to 2013 was relatively flat.

As of September 26, 2015, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses and tax credits of $7.8
billion and deferred tax liabilities of $24.1 billion. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of
existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and the amount of a valuation
allowance.

The U.S. Internal Revenue Service is currently examining the years 2010 through 2012, and all years prior to 2010 are closed. In
addition, the Company is subject to audits by state, local and foreign tax authorities. In major states and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 2003 generally remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing
authorities. Management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Companys
tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.

On June 11, 2014, the European Commission issued an opening decision initiating a formal investigation against Ireland for alleged state aid to the
Company. The opening decision concerns the allocation of profits for taxation purposes of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company. The Company believes the European Commissions assertions are without merit. If the European
Commission were to conclude against Ireland, the European Commission could require Ireland to recover from the Company past taxes covering a period of up to 10 years reflective of the disallowed state aid. While such amount could be material, as of
September 26, 2015 the Company is unable to estimate the impact.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to
be entitled when products are transferred to customers.

The original effective date for ASU 2014-09 would have required the Company to adopt
beginning in its first quarter of 2018. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  Deferral of the Effective Date, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for one year and
permits early adoption as early as the original effective date of ASU 2014-09. Accordingly, the Company may adopt the standard in either its first quarter of 2018 or 2019. The new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period
presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the timing of its adoption and the impact of adopting the new revenue standard on its consolidated financial
statements.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The following
table presents selected financial information and statistics as of and for the years ended September 26, 2015, September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013 (in millions):



Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities

Property, plant and equipment, net

Commercial paper

Total term debt

Working capital

Cash generated by operating activities

Cash used in investing activities

Cash used in financing activities

The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to
satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. The Company currently anticipates the cash used for future
dividends, the share repurchase program and debt repayments will come from its current domestic cash, cash generated from on-going U.S. operating activities and from borrowings.

As of September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014, the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign
subsidiaries were $186.9 billion and $137.1 billion, respectively, and are generally based in U.S. 
dollar-denominated
 holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income
taxation on repatriation to the U.S. The Companys marketable securities investment portfolio is invested primarily in highly-rated securities and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The
policy requires investments generally to be investment grade with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss.

During 2015,
cash generated from operating activities of $81.3 billion was a result of $53.4 billion of net income, non-cash adjustments to net income of $16.2 billion and an increase in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $11.7 billion. Cash
used in investing activities of $56.3 billion during 2015 consisted primarily of cash used for purchases of marketable securities, net of sales and maturities, of $44.4 billion and cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $11.2 billion.
Cash used in financing activities of $17.7 billion during 2015 consisted primarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of $35.3 billion and cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $11.6 billion, partially offset by net proceeds
from the issuance of term debt of $27.1 billion.

During 2014, cash generated from operating activities of $59.7 billion was a result of $39.5
billion of net income, non-cash adjustments to net income of $13.2 billion and an increase in net change in operating assets and liabilities of $7.0 billion. Cash used in investing activities of $22.6 billion during 2014 consisted primarily of cash
used for purchases of marketable securities, net of sales and maturities, of $9.0 billion; cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $9.6 billion; and cash paid for business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $3.8 billion. Cash used
in financing activities of $37.5 billion during 2014 consisted primarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of $45.0 billion and cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $11.1 billion, partially offset by net proceeds from the
issuance of term debt and commercial paper of $12.0 billion and $6.3 billion, respectively.

Capital Assets

The Companys capital expenditures were $11.2 billion during 2015. The Company anticipates utilizing approximately $15.0 billion for capital
expenditures during 2016, which includes product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; data centers; corporate facilities and infrastructure, including information systems hardware, software and enhancements; and retail store facilities.

Debt

In 2014, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to
issue unsecured short-term promissory notes (Commercial Paper) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and
share repurchases. As of September 26, 2015, the Company had $8.5 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.14% and maturities generally less than nine months.

As of September 26, 2015, the Company has outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes for an aggregate principal amount of $55.7 billion
(collectively the Notes). The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on the Notes. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into currency swaps to
manage foreign currency risk on the Notes. The future principal payments for the Companys Notes as of September 26, 2015 are as follows (in millions):

Capital Return Program

In April 2015, the Companys Board
of Directors increased the share repurchase program authorization from $90 billion to $140 billion of the Companys common stock, increasing the expected total size of the capital return program to $200 billion. The Company expects to execute
the capital return program by the end of March 2017 by paying dividends and dividend equivalents, repurchasing shares and remitting withheld taxes related to net share settlement of restricted stock units. To assist in funding its capital return
program, the Company expects to continue to access the debt markets, both domestically and internationally. As of September 26, 2015, $104 billion of the share repurchase program has been utilized. The Companys share repurchase program
does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended.

In April 2015, the Companys Board of Directors raised the quarterly cash dividend by 11%. The Company plans to increase its
dividend on an annual basis subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.

The following table presents the Companys dividends, dividend
equivalents, share repurchases and net share settlement activity from the start of the capital return program in August 2012 through September 26, 2015 (in millions):

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations

The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the Company has financial guarantees, subordinated retained
interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing,
liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to the Company, or engages in leasing, hedging, or R&D services with the Company.

The following
table presents certain payments due by the Company under contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of September 26, 2015, and excludes amounts already recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, except for term debt (in
millions):

Operating leases

Purchase commitments

Other obligations





















Total





















Operating Leases

The
Companys major facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options. As of September 26, 2015, the Company had a total of 463 retail stores. Leases for retail space are for terms
ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of September 26, 2015, the Companys total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $6.3
billion, of which $3.6 billion related to leases for retail space.

Purchase Commitments

The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Companys products and to perform final assembly and testing
of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products
from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Where
appropriate, the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier. As of September 26, 2015, the Company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party
manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of $29.5 billion.

Other Obligations

The Companys other off-balance sheet obligations were comprised of commitments to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and
manufacturing process equipment, and commitments related to inventory prepayments, advertising, licensing, R&D, internet and telecommunications services, energy and other obligations.

The Companys other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets consist primarily of deferred tax liabilities, gross unrecognized tax
benefits and the related gross interest and penalties. As of September 26, 2015, the Company had non-current deferred tax liabilities of $24.1 billion. Additionally, as of September 26, 2015, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits
of $6.9 billion and an additional $1.3 billion for gross interest and penalties classified as non-current liabilities. At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in
connection with these tax liabilities; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table.

Indemnification

The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes
third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the
Company or an indemnified third-party. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of end-users of its operating system or application
software for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. The Company did not record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of September 26, 2015 or September 27, 2014.



Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 32



In September 2015, the Company introduced the iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who
purchase an iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in one of its U.S. physical retail stores and activate the purchased iPhone with one of the four national carriers. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a new iPhone,
provided certain conditions are met. One of the conditions of this program requires the customer to finance the initial purchase price of the iPhone with a third-party lender. Upon exercise of the trade-in right and purchase of a new iPhone, the
Company satisfies the customers outstanding balance due to the third-party lender on the original device. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such
right with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within revenue.

The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its
directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance
expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of
prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. However, the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of
financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and the Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the
Companys management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from
these estimates, and such differences may be material.

Management believes the Companys critical accounting policies and estimates are those
related to revenue recognition, valuation and impairment of marketable securities, inventory valuation and valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and
other contingencies. Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about
inherently uncertain matters. The Companys senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Companys Board of Directors.

Revenue Recognition

Net sales consist primarily of revenue
from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, accessories, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed
or determinable and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. For most of the Companys product sales, these criteria
are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company
retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. For payment terms in excess of the Companys standard payment terms, revenue is recognized as payments become due unless the Company has positive evidence that the sales price
is fixed or determinable, such as a successful history of collection, without concession, on comparable arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the
functionality of the hardware and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry-specific software accounting
guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.

For multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware products functionality,
undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware products essential software and/or undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances,
the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price
(TPE) and (iii) best estimate of selling price (ESP). VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs reflect the
Companys best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis.



Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 33



For sales of qualifying versions of iOS devices, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV, the Company has indicated it
may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades to the devices essential software and/or non-software services free of charge. Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the
non-software services, revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the Companys ESPs. Revenue allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services based on the Companys ESPs is deferred and
recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided.

The
Companys process for determining ESPs involves managements judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Should future facts and
circumstances change, the Companys ESPs and the future rate of related amortization for unspecified software upgrades and non-software services related to future sales of these devices could change. Factors subject to change include the
unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services offered, the estimated value of unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services and the estimated period unspecified software upgrades and non-software services are expected
to be provided.

The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive
programs. For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition
have been met. The Companys policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. For the Companys other customer incentive programs,
the estimated cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the
Companys historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue. Additionally, certain customer incentive
programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. Managements estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a
greater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have an adverse impact on the Companys operating results.

Valuation and Impairment of Marketable Securities

The
Companys investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, in the
Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities impact the Companys net income only when such securities are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. Realized gains and
losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each securitys cost basis. The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would
require the Company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, the Company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost;
the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and the Companys intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. The Companys
assessment on whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security, which would have an adverse impact on the Companys operating
results.

Inventory Valuation and Valuation of Manufacturing-Related Assets and Estimated Purchase Commitment Cancellation Fees

The Company must purchase components and build inventory in advance of product shipments and has invested in manufacturing-related assets, including
capital assets held at its suppliers facilities. In addition, the Company has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. The Company records a write-down
for inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed review of inventory that considers
multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels and component cost trends. The Company also reviews its manufacturing-related capital assets and inventory prepayments for
impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an asset is not recoverable, it records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value
of such an asset exceeds its fair value.

The industries in which the Company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and
component obsolescence and demand changes. In certain circumstances the Company may be required to record additional write-downs of inventory and/or manufacturing-related assets. These circumstances include future demand or market conditions for the
Companys products being less favorable than forecasted, unforeseen technological changes or changes to the Companys product development plans that negatively impact the utility of any of these assets, or significant deterioration in the
financial condition of one or more of the Companys suppliers that hold any of the Companys manufacturing-related assets or to whom the Company has made an inventory prepayment. Such write-downs would adversely affect the Companys
financial condition and operating results in the period when the write-downs were recorded.



Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 34



The Company accrues for estimated cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been cancelled or
are expected to be cancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders in each case based on projected demand. Where appropriate, the purchases
are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier. Purchase commitments typically cover the Companys forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150
days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Companys products, a change in the Companys product development plans, or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the
Companys products, the Company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded.

Warranty Costs

The Company accrues for the estimated cost of
warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Companys typical
experience. The Company regularly reviews these estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities or the current installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. If actual product
failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the Companys financial condition and operating results.

Income Taxes

The Company records a tax provision for the
anticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results. The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences
of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that
apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than
not to be realized.

The Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will
be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than
50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.

Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income
that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. In the event that the Company determines all
or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the Company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax
liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP and complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with managements expectations could have a material
impact on the Companys financial condition and operating results.

Legal and Other Contingencies

As discussed in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading Legal Proceedings and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies, the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability when it
is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. In the opinion of management,
there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. However, the outcome of legal
proceedings and claims brought against the Company is subject to significant uncertainty. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the
Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations, the Companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.

Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management

The Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a

stand-alone
 basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures. Given the effective horizons of the Companys risk management activities and the anticipatory
nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses
related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Companys financial condition and operating results.

Interest Rate Risk

The Companys exposure to changes in
interest rates relates primarily to the Companys investment portfolio and outstanding debt. While the Company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, the Companys interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in
U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid
on the Companys debt.

The Companys investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the
Companys liquidity requirements. The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its
investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy requires investments generally to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. To provide a
meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Companys investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment
portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would
result in a $4.3 billion and $3.4 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.

As of September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an
aggregate carrying amount of $56.0 billion and $29.0 billion, respectively. The Company has entered, and may enter in the future, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the
Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. Gains and losses on these instruments are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related
hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Companys debt as of September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014 to increase by $200 million and $110 million on an annualized
basis, respectively.

Further details regarding the Companys debt is provided in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 
10-K
 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 6, Debt.

Foreign Currency Risk

In general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a
strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Companys net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures
when there have been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.

The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option
contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
In addition, the Company has entered, and may enter in the future, into non-designated foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign-denominated debt issuances. The Companys
practice is to hedge a portion of its material foreign exchange exposures, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to
accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.



Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 36



To provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the
Companys foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (VAR) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a
Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Companys foreign currency derivative
positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The model assumes normal market conditions. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $342 million as of September 26, 2015
compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $240 million as of September 27, 2014. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by
increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.

Actual future gains and losses associated with the Companys investment portfolio and
derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 26, 2015 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency
exchanges rates and the Companys actual exposures and positions.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Apple Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively Apple or the Company) designs, manufactures and
markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers and portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, accessories, networking solutions and third-party digital content and applications. The Company
sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores and direct sales force, as well as through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of
third-party Apple-compatible products, including application software and various accessories through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers.

Basis of Presentation and Preparation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated. In the opinion of the Companys management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these
consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements
and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

The Companys fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that
ends on the last Saturday of September. The Companys fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 ended on September 26, 2015, September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013, respectively. An additional week is included in the first fiscal
quarter approximately every six years to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 each spanned 52 weeks. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the
Companys fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.

Revenue Recognition

Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, accessories, and service
and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once
it has been shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. For most of the Companys product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to
education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. For payment terms in excess of
the Companys standard payment terms, revenue is recognized as payments become due unless the Company has positive evidence that the sales price is fixed or determinable, such as a successful history of collection, without concession, on
comparable arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance
with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software products,
(ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.

For
the sale of most third-party products, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers because the Company establishes its own pricing for such products, retains related inventory risk for physical products, is the
primary obligor to the customer and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. For third-party applications sold through the App Store and Mac App Store and certain digital content sold through the iTunes Store, the Company does
not determine the selling price of the products and is not the primary obligor to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in net sales only the commission it retains from each sale. The portion of
the gross amount billed to customers that is remitted by the Company to third-party app developers and certain digital content owners is not reflected in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations.



Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 44



The Company records deferred revenue when it receives payments in advance of the delivery of products or the
performance of services. This includes amounts that have been deferred for unspecified and specified software upgrade rights and non-software services that are attached to hardware and software products. The Company sells gift cards redeemable at
its retail and online stores, and also sells gift cards redeemable on iTunes Store, App Store, Mac App Store and iBooks Store for the purchase of digital content and software. The Company records deferred revenue upon the sale of the card, which is
relieved upon redemption of the card by the customer. Revenue from AppleCare service and support contracts is deferred and recognized over the service coverage periods. AppleCare service and support contracts typically include extended phone
support, repair services, web-based support resources and diagnostic tools offered under the Companys standard limited warranty.

The Company
records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs. For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded. For
the Companys other customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company also records
reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Companys historical experience. Revenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded
as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.

Revenue Recognition for Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables

For multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware products functionality, undelivered
software elements that relate to the hardware products essential software, and undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the Company uses
a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (TPE) and
(iii) best estimate of selling price (ESP). VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs reflect the Companys best
estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. For multi-element arrangements accounted for in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance, the Company allocates
revenue to all deliverables based on the VSOE of each element, and if VSOE does not exist revenue is recognized when elements lacking VSOE are delivered.

For sales of qualifying versions of iPhone, iPad and iPod touch (iOS devices), Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV, the Company has indicated it
may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades to the devices essential software and/or non-software services free of charge. The Company has identified up to three deliverables regularly included in arrangements involving
the sale of these devices. The first deliverable, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale. The second
deliverable is the embedded right included with qualifying devices to receive on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the products essential software. The third deliverable is the non-software
services to be provided to qualifying devices. The Company allocates revenue between these deliverables using the relative selling price method. Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for these deliverables, the allocation of revenue is based
on the Companys ESPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software is recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. Revenue allocated to the embedded
unspecified software upgrade rights and the non-software services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to
delivered hardware and related essential software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide non-software services are recognized as cost of sales as incurred, and engineering and sales and
marketing costs are recognized as operating expenses as incurred.

The Companys process for determining its ESP for deliverables without VSOE
or TPE considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company and market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product
specific business objectives, length of time a particular version of a device has been available, estimated cost to provide the non-software services and the relative ESP of the upgrade rights and non-software services as compared to the total
selling price of the product.

Beginning in September 2015, the Company reduced the combined ESPs for iOS devices and Mac between $5 and $10 to
reflect the increase in competitive offers for similar products at little to no cost for users, which reduces the amount the Company could reasonably charge for these deliverables on a standalone basis.

Shipping Costs

Amounts billed to customers related to shipping
and handling are classified as revenue, and the Companys shipping and handling costs are classified as cost of sales.



Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 45



Warranty Costs

The Company generally provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. The Company
assesses the adequacy of its accrued warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates.

Software Development Costs

Research and development
(R&D) costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a products technological feasibility has been established and
ending when a product is available for general release to customers. In most instances, the Companys products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established and as a result software development costs were expensed as
incurred.

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs are
expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Advertising expense was $1.8 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Share-based Compensation

The Company recognizes expense
related to share-based payment transactions in which it receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the Company or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the Companys equity instruments or that
may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. Share-based compensation cost for restricted stock and restricted stock units (RSUs) is measured based on the closing fair market value of the Companys common stock on the
date of grant. The Company recognizes share-based compensation cost over the awards requisite service period on a straight-line basis for time-based RSUs and on a graded basis for RSUs that are contingent on the achievement of performance
conditions. The Company recognizes a benefit from share-based compensation in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity if an excess tax benefit is realized. In addition, the Company recognizes the indirect effects of share-based
compensation on R&D tax credits, foreign tax credits and domestic manufacturing deductions in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9, Benefit Plans.

Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes is computed
using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for
operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be
realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.

The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on
examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood
of being realized upon settlement. See Note 5, Income Taxes for additional information.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of
additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued. Potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options, shares to be purchased under the Companys employee
stock purchase plan, unvested restricted stock and unvested RSUs. The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an
increase in the fair market value of the Companys common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities.



Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 46

earnings per share.

Financial Instruments

Cash Equivalents and
Marketable Securities

All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash
equivalents. The Companys marketable debt and equity securities have been classified and accounted for as 
available-for-sale.
 Management determines the appropriate
classification of its investments at the time of purchase and reevaluates the classifications at each balance sheet date. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instruments
underlying contractual maturity date. Marketable debt securities with maturities of 12 months or less are classified as short-term and marketable debt securities with maturities greater than 12 months are classified as long-term. Marketable equity
securities, including mutual funds, are classified as either short-term or long-term based on the nature of each security and its availability for use in current operations. The Companys marketable debt and equity securities are carried at
fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) in shareholders equity, with the exception of unrealized losses believed to be
other-than-temporary which are reported in earnings in the current period. The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company accounts for its
derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value.

For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to
variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of AOCI in shareholders equity and reclassified into earnings
in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in earnings in the current period. To receive hedge accounting
treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge
effectiveness and are recognized in earnings.

For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a
liability and that are designated as fair value hedges, both the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item are recognized in earnings in the current period.

For derivative instruments and foreign currency debt that hedge the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates used for translation of the
net investment in a foreign operation and that are designated as a net investment hedge, the net gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative instrument is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For
forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this
forward carry component are recognized in earnings in the current period.

Derivatives that do not qualify as hedges are adjusted to fair value
through earnings in the current period.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors, including historical experience, age of the accounts
receivable balances, credit quality of the Companys customers, current economic conditions and other factors that may affect the customers ability to pay.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost,
computed using the first-in, first-out method and net realizable value. Any adjustments to reduce the cost of inventories to their net realizable value are recognized in earnings in the current period. As of September 26, 2015 and
September 27, 2014, the Companys inventories consist primarily of finished goods.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use of the 
straight-line
 method over
the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building; between one to five years for machinery and equipment, including product tooling and manufacturing process
equipment; and the shorter of lease terms or ten years for leasehold improvements. The Company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs
related to internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $9.2 billion, $6.9
billion and $5.8 billion during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets

The Company reviews property, plant and equipment, inventory component prepayments and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for
impairment. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts
to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property, plant and equipment, inventory component prepayments and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the
amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value.

The Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives, rather such assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. The Company performs its goodwill and intangible
asset impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year. The Company did not recognize any impairment charges related to goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets during 2015, 2014 and 2013. The Company established reporting units based on
its current reporting structure. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit. In 2015 and 2014, the Companys goodwill was primarily
allocated to the Americas and Europe reporting units.

The Company amortizes its intangible assets with definite useful lives over their estimated
useful lives and reviews these assets for impairment. The Company typically amortizes its acquired intangible assets with definite useful lives over periods from three to seven years.

Fair Value Measurements

The Company applies fair value
accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair value as the price that would be
received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded
at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as
risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within
the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:

Level 1 
 Quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 
 Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and
liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

Level 3 
 Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect managements estimate of assumptions that market participants
would use in pricing the asset or liability.



Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 48



The Companys valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certain
marketable equity securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Companys debt instruments and all other financial instruments,
all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings, were valued based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.

In accordance with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair
value. The Company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments.

Foreign Currency Translation and Remeasurement

The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect
at the end of each period. Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are recognized in foreign currency translation included in
AOCI in shareholders equity. The Companys subsidiaries that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and inventories, property and
nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates.

The Company may sell certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic reasons
including, but not limited to, anticipation of credit deterioration and duration management. The maturities of the Companys long-term marketable securities generally range from one to five years.

As of September 26, 2015, the Company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary in
nature and does not consider any of its investments other-than-temporarily impaired. The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy
generally requires investments to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating an investment
for other-than-temporary impairment the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below its cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, changes in market interest rates
and the Companys intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the investments cost basis.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company may use
derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, on net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and on certain existing assets and liabilities. However, the Company
may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than
a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates.

To help protect gross margins from
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Companys subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and subsidiaries whose functional currency is not
the U.S. dollar and who sell in local currencies may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries functional currencies. The Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other
instruments to manage this risk and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12
months.

To help protect the net investment in a foreign operation from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter
into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the Company may use non-derivative financial instruments, such
as its foreign currency-denominated debt, as economic hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company designates these instruments as net investment hedges.



Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 50



The Company may also enter into non-designated foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign
currency exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.

The
Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options, or other instruments to manage interest rate risk. These instruments may offset a portion of changes in income or expense, or changes in fair value of the Companys term debt or investments.
The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. The Companys hedged interest rate transactions as of September 26, 2015 are expected to be recognized within 10 years.

Cash Flow Hedges

The effective portions of cash flow hedges
are recorded in AOCI until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is
recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow
hedges of interest income or expense are recognized in other income/(expense), net in the same period as the related income or expense is recognized. The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of cash flow hedges
are recognized in other income/(expense), net.

Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is
probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified
immediately into other income/(expense), net. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in other income/(expense), net unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions.

Net Investment Hedges

The effective portions of net investment
hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI) as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of net investment hedges are recognized in other
income/(expense), net.

Fair Value Hedges

Gains and losses
related to changes in fair value hedges are recognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of the underlying hedged item.

Non-Designated Derivatives

Derivatives that are not designated
as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial statement line item to which the derivative relates.

The Company
records all derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Companys accounting treatment for these derivative instruments is based on its hedge designation. The following tables show the Companys derivative instruments
at gross fair value as of September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014 (in millions):

Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 52



The notional amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume
outstanding and do not represent the amount of the Companys exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts represent the Companys gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or
unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on 
then-current
 currency or interest rates at each respective date. The Companys exposure to credit loss
and market risk will vary over time as currency and interest rates change. Although the table above reflects the notional and credit risk amounts of the Companys derivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with
the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market
conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.

The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce
credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net
fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The net cash
collateral received by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $1.0 billion as of September 26, 2015 and $2.1 billion as of September 27, 2014.

Under master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Companys derivative contracts, the Company is allowed to net
settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Companys derivative contracts,
including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $2.2 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, resulting in net derivative liabilities of $78 million and $549
million, respectively.

Accounts Receivable

Trade Receivables

The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, value-added resellers,
small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. In
addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing
arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.

As of September 26, 2015, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 12%. As of
September 27, 2014, the Company had two customers that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, one of which accounted for 16% and the other 13%. The Companys cellular network carriers accounted for 71% and 72% of trade
receivables as of September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014, respectively.

Vendor Non-Trade Receivables

The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture
sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. Vendor non-trade receivables from three of the Companys vendors accounted for 38%, 18% and 14% of total vendor non-trade
receivables as of September 26, 2015 and three of the Companys vendors accounted for 51%, 16% and 14% of total vendor non-trade receivables as of September 27, 2014.

Note 4  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

On July 31, 2014, the Company completed the acquisitions of Beats Music, LLC, which offers a subscription streaming music service,
and Beats Electronics, LLC, which makes Beats
®
 headphones, speakers and audio software (collectively, Beats). The total purchase price consideration for these acquisitions was $2.6
billion, which consisted primarily of cash, of which $2.2 billion was allocated to goodwill, $636 million to acquired intangible assets and $258 million to net liabilities assumed. Concurrent with the close of the acquisitions, the Company repaid
$295 million of existing Beats outstanding debt to third-party creditors. In conjunction with the Beats acquisitions, the Company issued approximately 5.1 million shares of its common stock to certain former equity holders of Beats. The
restricted stock was valued at approximately $485 million based on the Companys common stock on the acquisition date. The majority of these shares, valued at approximately $417 million, will vest over time based on continued employment with
Apple.

The Company also completed various other business acquisitions during 2014 for an aggregate cash consideration, net of cash acquired, of $957
million, of which $828 million was allocated to goodwill, $257 million to acquired intangible assets and $128 million to net liabilities assumed.

The Companys acquired intangible assets with definite useful lives primarily consist of patents and licenses and are amortized over periods
typically from three to seven years. The following table summarizes the components of gross and net intangible asset balances as of September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014 (in millions):

Provision for income taxes













The foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pre-tax earnings of $47.6 billion, $33.6 billion and $30.5
billion in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Companys consolidated financial statements provide for any related tax liability on undistributed earnings that the Company does not intend to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.
Substantially all of the Companys undistributed international earnings intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the U.S. were generated by subsidiaries organized in Ireland, which has a statutory tax rate of 12.5%. As of
September 26, 2015, U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $91.5 billion of such earnings. The amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these temporary differences is estimated to be $30.0 billion.

As of September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014, $186.9 billion and $137.1 billion, respectively, of the Companys cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. 
dollar-denominated
 holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income
taxation on repatriation to the U.S.

A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes, with the amount computed by applying the statutory federal
income tax rate (35% in 2015, 2014 and 2013) to income before provision for income taxes for 2015, 2014 and 2013, is as follows (dollars in millions):



Computed expected tax

State taxes, net of federal effect

Indefinitely invested earnings of foreign subsidiaries

Domestic production activities deduction

Research and development credit, net

Provision for income taxes













Effective tax rate

The Companys income taxes payable have been reduced by the tax benefits from employee stock plan awards. For stock
options, the Company receives an income tax benefit calculated as the tax effect of the difference between the fair market value of the stock issued at the time of the exercise and the exercise price. For RSUs, the Company receives an income
tax benefit upon the awards vesting equal to the tax effect of the underlying stocks fair market value. The Company had net excess tax benefits from equity awards of $748 million, $706 million and $643 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013,
respectively, which were reflected as increases to common stock.



Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 55



As of September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014, the significant components of the Companys
deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in millions):



Deferred tax assets:

Accrued liabilities and other reserves

Basis of capital assets and investments

Deferred revenue

Deferred cost sharing

Share-based compensation

Unrealized losses

Other









Total deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance of $0









Deferred tax liabilities:

Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries

Other









Total deferred tax liabilities









Net deferred tax liabilities









Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits and the future income tax effects of
temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

Uncertain Tax Positions

Tax positions are evaluated in a two-step process. The Company first determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained
upon examination. If a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold it is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit
that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company classifies gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as
non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

As of September 26, 2015, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was
$6.9 billion, of which $2.5 billion, if recognized, would affect the Companys effective tax rate. As of September 27, 2014, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $4.0 billion, of which $1.4 billion, if recognized, would
affect the Companys effective tax rate.

The aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and
penalties, for 2015, 2014 and 2013, is as follows (in millions):



Beginning Balance

Increases related to tax positions taken during a prior year

Decreases related to tax positions taken during a prior year

Increases related to tax positions taken during the current year

Decreases related to settlements with taxing authorities

Decreases related to expiration of statute of limitations













Ending Balance













The Company includes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes.
As of September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014, the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $1.3 billion and $630 million, respectively, which is classified as non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
In connection with tax matters, the Company recognized interest and penalty expense in 2015, 2014 and 2013 of $709 million, $40 million and $189 million, respectively.



Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 56



The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many
state and foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) is currently examining the years 2010 through 2012, and all years prior to 2010 are closed. In addition, the Company is subject to audits by state, local and
foreign tax authorities. In major states and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 2003 generally remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities.

Management believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax
audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Companys tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes
in the period such resolution occurs. Although timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits would materially change in the next
12 months.

On June 11, 2014, the European Commission issued an opening decision initiating a formal investigation against Ireland for
alleged state aid to the Company. The opening decision concerns the allocation of profits for taxation purposes of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company. The Company believes the European Commissions assertions are without
merit. If the European Commission were to conclude against Ireland, the European Commission could require Ireland to recover from the Company past taxes covering a period of up to 10 years reflective of the disallowed state aid. While such amount
could be material, as of September 26, 2015 the Company is unable to estimate the impact.

Note 6  Debt

Commercial Paper

In 2014, the Board of
Directors authorized the Company to issue unsecured short-term promissory notes (Commercial Paper) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company intends to use net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate
purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014, the Company had $8.5 billion and $6.3 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, respectively, with a weighted-average interest rate of
0.14% and 0.12%, respectively, and maturities generally less than nine months.

Long-Term Debt

As of
September 26, 2015, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $55.7 billion (collectively the Notes). The Notes are senior unsecured obligations, and
interest is payable in arrears, quarterly for the U.S. dollar-denominated and Australian dollar-denominated floating-rate notes, semi-annually for the U.S. dollar-denominated, Australian dollar-denominated, British pound-denominated and Japanese
yen-denominated fixed-rate notes and annually for the euro-denominated and Swiss franc-denominated fixed-rate notes.

To manage foreign currency risk associated with the euro-denominated notes issued in the first quarter of 2015 and the
British pound-denominated, Australian dollar-denominated and euro-denominated notes issued in the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company entered into currency swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $3.5 billion, $1.9 billion, $1.6 billion and $2.2
billion, respectively, which effectively converted these notes to U.S. dollar-denominated notes.



Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 58



To manage interest rate risk on the U.S. dollar-denominated fixed-rate notes issued in the second quarter of
2015 and maturing in 2020 and 2022, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $2.5 billion. To manage interest rate risk on the U.S. dollar-denominated fixed-rate notes issued in the third quarter of 2015 and
maturing in 2017, 2020, 2022 and 2025, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $4.3 billion. These interest rate swaps effectively converted the fixed interest rates on the U.S. dollar-denominated notes to a
floating interest rate.

As of September 26, 2015, ¥250.0 billion of the Japanese yen-denominated notes was designated as a hedge of the
foreign currency exposure of its net investment in a foreign operation. The foreign currency transaction gain or loss on the Japanese yen-denominated debt designated as a hedge is recorded in OCI as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment.
As of September 26, 2015, the carrying value of the debt designated as a net investment hedge was $2.1 billion.

For further discussion
regarding the Companys use of derivative instruments see the Derivative Financial Instruments section of Note 2, Financial Instruments.

The effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes, amortization of the discount and, if applicable, adjustments related to
hedging. The Company recognized $722 million, $381 million and $136 million of interest expense on its term debt for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Share Repurchase Program

In the third quarter of 2015, the Companys Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization to $140 billion of the Companys
common stock, of which $104 billion had been utilized as of September 26, 2015. The Companys share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately
negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act).

The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into accelerated share repurchase arrangements (ASRs) with financial institutions. In
exchange for up-front payments, the financial institutions deliver shares of the Companys common stock during the purchase periods of each ASR. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average repurchase price paid
per share, is determined at the end of the applicable purchase period of each ASR based on the volume weighted-average price of the Companys common stock during that period. The shares received are retired in the periods they are delivered,
and the up-front payments are accounted for as a reduction to shareholders equity in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets in the periods the payments are made. The Company reflects the ASRs as a repurchase of common stock in the
period delivered for purposes of calculating earnings per share and as forward contracts indexed to its own common stock. The ASRs met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification, and therefore were not accounted for as derivative
instruments.

The following table shows the Companys ASR activity and related information during the years ended September 26, 2015 and
September 27, 2014:



May 2015 ASR

August 2014 ASR

Note 8  Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and OCI. OCI refers to revenue, expenses, and gains and losses that under
GAAP are recorded as an element of shareholders equity but are excluded from net income. The Companys OCI consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional
currency, net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges and unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities classified as available-for-sale.

The following table shows the pre-tax amounts reclassified from AOCI into the Consolidated Statements of Operations, and the associated financial
statement line item, for 2015 and 2014 (in millions):

Note 9  Benefit Plans

2014 Employee Stock Plan

In the second
quarter of 2014, shareholders approved the 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the 2014 Plan) and terminated the Companys authority to grant new awards under the 2003 Employee Stock Plan (the 2003 Plan). The 2014 Plan provides
for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of RSUs, stock grants, performance-based awards, stock options and stock appreciation rights, as well as cash bonus awards. RSUs granted under the
2014 Plan generally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Companys common stock on a one-for-one basis. Each share issued with respect to RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan reduces the
number of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares. RSUs cancelled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under the 2014 Plan utilizing a factor of two times the
number of RSUs cancelled or shares withheld. Currently, all RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan have dividend equivalent rights (DERs), which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DERs are
subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. Upon approval of the 2014 Plan, the Company reserved 385 million shares plus the
number of shares remaining that were reserved but not issued under the 2003 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2003 Plan that expire, are cancelled or otherwise terminate, or are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations with
respect to RSUs, will also be available for awards under the 2014 Plan. As of September 26, 2015, approximately 442.9 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2014 Plan.

2003 Employee Stock Plan

The 2003 Plan is a shareholder
approved plan that provided for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers. The 2003 Plan permitted the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, stock purchase rights
and performance-based awards. Options granted under the 2003 Plan generally expire seven to ten years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based on continued employment, with either annual, semi-annual
or quarterly vesting. RSUs granted under the 2003 Plan generally vest over two to four years, based on continued employment and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Companys common stock on a one-for-one basis. All RSUs, other than RSUs
held by the Chief Executive Officer, granted under the 2003 Plan have DERs. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. In the
second quarter of 2014, the Company terminated the authority to grant new awards under the 2003 Plan.

1997 Director Stock Plan

The 1997 Director Stock Plan (the Director Plan) is a shareholder approved plan that (i) permits the Company to grant awards of RSUs or
stock options to the Companys non-employee directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the Board of Directors and automatic annual grants of RSUs at each annual meeting of
shareholders, and (iii) permits the Board of Directors to prospectively change the relative mixture of stock options and RSUs for the initial and annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the Companys
common stock subject to these grants without shareholder approval. Each share issued with respect to RSUs granted under the Director Plan reduces the number of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares. The Director Plan expires
November 9, 2019. All RSUs granted under the Director Plan are entitled to DERs. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares
vest. As of September 26, 2015, approximately 1.2 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Director Plan.

Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans

During the fourth quarter of 2015, Section 16 officers Timothy D. Cook, Angela Ahrendts, Luca Maestri, Daniel Riccio, Philip Schiller and
Jeffrey Williams had equity trading plans in place in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. An equity trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts,
prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Companys stock, including shares acquired pursuant to the Companys employee and director equity plans.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(the Purchase Plan) is a shareholder approved plan under which substantially all employees may purchase the Companys common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values of the
stock as of the beginning or the end of six-month offering periods. An employees payroll deductions under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of the employees compensation and employees may not purchase more than $25,000 of stock during
any calendar year. As of September 26, 2015, approximately 53.0 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan.



Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 62



401(k) Plan

The
Companys 401(k) Plan is a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the IRS annual contribution
limit ($18,000 for calendar year 2015). The Company matches 50% to 100% of each employees contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employees eligible earnings. The Companys matching contributions to
the 401(k) Plan were $200 million, $163 million and $135 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Restricted Stock Units

A summary of the Companys RSU activity and related information for 2015, 2014 and 2013, is as follows:



Balance at September 29, 2012

RSUs granted

RSUs vested

RSUs cancelled





Balance at September 28, 2013

RSUs granted

RSUs vested

RSUs cancelled





Balance at September 27, 2014

RSUs granted

RSUs vested

RSUs cancelled





Balance at September 26, 2015





The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $4.8 billion, $3.4 billion and $3.1 billion for 2015, 2014
and 2013, respectively. The majority of RSUs that vested in 2015, 2014 and 2013 were net-share settled such that the Company withheld shares with value equivalent to the employees minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and
other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 14.1 million, 15.6 million and 15.5 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and were based on the
value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Companys closing stock price. Total payments for the employees tax obligations to taxing authorities were $1.6 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion in 2015, 2014
and 2013, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These net-share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the Company as they reduced the number of shares that would
have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting and did not represent an expense to the Company.

Stock Options

The Company had 1.2 million stock options outstanding as of September 26, 2015, with a weighted-average exercise price per share of $15.08 and
weighted-average remaining contractual term of 4.1 years, substantially all of which are exercisable. The aggregate intrinsic value of the stock options outstanding as of September 26, 2015 was $120 million, which represents the value of the
Companys closing stock price on the last trading day of the period in excess of the weighted-average exercise price multiplied by the number of options outstanding. Total intrinsic value of options at time of exercise was $479 million, $1.5
billion and $1.0 billion for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

The income tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense was $1.2 billion, $1.0 billion and $816 million for
2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. As of September 26, 2015, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding stock options, RSUs and restricted stock was $6.8 billion, which the Company expects to recognize over a
weighted-average period of 2.7 years.

The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims
that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an
infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of end-users of its
operating system or application software for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. The Company did not record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of September 26, 2015 or September 27, 2014.

In September 2015, the Company introduced the iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase an iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in one
of its U.S. physical retail stores and activate the purchased iPhone with one of the four national carriers. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. One
of the conditions of this program requires the customer to finance the initial purchase price of the iPhone with a third-party lender. Upon exercise of the trade-in right and purchase of a new iPhone, the Company satisfies the customers
outstanding balance due to the third-party lender on the original device. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right with subsequent changes to the
guarantee liability recognized within revenue.

The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers.
Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such
individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification
claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. However, the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations.

Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product

Although most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources, a number of components are currently
obtained from single or limited sources. In addition, the Company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers. Therefore, many components used by the
Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Companys financial condition and operating
results.



Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 64



The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products
introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing
capacity has increased. If the Companys supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Companys financial condition
and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Companys business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source,
or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of
components customized to meet the Companys requirements.

The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however,
there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially
adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.

Substantially all of the Companys hardware products are manufactured by
outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are the
sole-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the Companys products. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Companys operating results could be adversely
affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The Companys purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days.

Other Off-Balance Sheet Commitments

Operating Leases

The Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not
currently utilize any other off-balance sheet financing arrangements. The major facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options. As of September 26, 2015, the Company had a total
of 463 retail stores. Leases for retail space are for terms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of September 26, 2015, the Companys total future minimum
lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $6.3 billion, of which $3.6 billion related to leases for retail space.

Rent expense under
all operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $794 million, $717 million and $645 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having remaining terms
in excess of one year as of September 26, 2015, are as follows (in millions):

Other Commitments

The Company
utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Companys products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand
information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires
components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts and open orders based on projected demand information. Where appropriate, the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that
are outstanding with the respective supplier. As of September 26, 2015, the Company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of $29.5 billion.



Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 65



In addition to the commitments mentioned above, the Company had other off-balance sheet obligations of $7.3
billion as of September 26, 2015 that consisted of commitments to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and commitments related to inventory prepayments, advertising, licensing, R&D, internet
and telecommunications services, energy and other obligations.

Contingencies

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully
adjudicated, certain of which are discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading Risk Factors and in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading Legal Proceedings. In the opinion of
management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. However, the
outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in
excess of managements expectations, the Companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.

Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd, et al.

On
August 24, 2012, a jury returned a verdict awarding the Company $1.05 billion in its lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd and affiliated parties in the United States District Court, Northern District of California, San Jose Division. On
March 6, 2014, the District Court entered final judgment in favor of the Company in the amount of approximately $930 million. On May 18, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed in part, and reversed in part,
the decision of the District Court. As a result, the Court of Appeals ordered entry of final judgment on damages in the amount of approximately $548 million, with the District Court to determine supplemental damages and interest, as well as damages
owed for products subject to the reversal in part. Because the ruling remains subject to further proceedings, the Company has not recognized the award in its results of operations.

Note 11  Segment Information and Geographic Data

The Company reports segment information based on the management approach. The management approach designates the internal
reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Companys reportable operating segments.

The
Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Companys reportable operating segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. The Americas segment includes both North and South
America. The Europe segment includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. The Greater China segment includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The Rest of Asia Pacific segment includes Australia and those Asian countries not
included in the Companys other reportable operating segments. Although each reportable operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services, they are managed separately to better align with the location of the
Companys customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies.

The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable operating segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for
geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Companys retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of
sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and
certain expenses managed outside the reportable operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as R&D, corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income
taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.

Report of Ernst & Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Apple Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 26, 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Apple Inc. at September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 26, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Apple Inc.s internal
control over financial reporting as of September 26, 2015, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control  Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013
framework) and our report dated October 28, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Ernst & Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Apple Inc.

We have audited Apple Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of September 26, 2015, based on criteria established in 
Internal
Control  Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Apple Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 26, 2015, based
on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
2015 consolidated financial statements of Apple Inc. and our report dated October 28, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, the Companys principal executive officer
and principal financial officer have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) were effective
as of September 26, 2015 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Inherent Limitations Over Internal Controls

The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that:



pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Companys
assets;



provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the
Companys receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Companys management and directors; and



provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Companys assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.

Management, including the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, does not expect that the Companys internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations
in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject
to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Companys assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 26, 2015 to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Companys independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has
issued an audit report on the Companys internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Changes in
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the fourth
quarter of 2015, which were identified in connection with managements evaluation required by paragraph (d) of rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting
 Policies

Apple Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries
 (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”)
 designs, manufactures and markets mobile communication and media
 devices, personal computers and portable digital music players, and
 sells a variety of related software, services, accessories,
 networking solutions and third-party digital content and
 applications. The Company sells its products worldwide through its
 retail stores, online stores and direct sales force, as well as
 through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers,
 retailers and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells
 a variety of third-party Apple-compatible products, including
 application software and various accessories through its online and
 retail stores. The Company sells to consumers, small and mid-sized
 businesses and education, enterprise and government customers.

Basis of Presentation and Preparation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
 include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and
 transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the
 Company’s management, the consolidated financial statements
 reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature,
 necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The
 preparation of these consolidated financial statements in
 conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
 (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and
 assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated
 financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could
 differ materially from those estimates.

The Company’s fiscal year is the 52 or
 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The
 Company’s fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 ended on
 September 26, 2015, September 27, 2014 and
 September 28, 2013, respectively. An additional week is
 included in the first fiscal quarter approximately every six years
 to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Fiscal years
 2015, 2014 and 2013 each spanned 52 weeks. Unless otherwise stated,
 references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer
 to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the
 associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.

Revenue Recognition

Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the
 sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications,
 accessories, and service and support contracts. The Company
 recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
 exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or
 determinable and collection is probable. Product is considered
 delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title, risk
 of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. For most of
 the Company’s product sales, these criteria are met at the
 time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for
 some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain
 other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives
 the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of
 loss on these sales during transit. For payment terms in excess of
 the Company’s standard payment terms, revenue is recognized
 as payments become due unless the Company has positive evidence
 that the sales price is fixed or determinable, such as a successful
 history of collection, without concession, on comparable
 arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of
 hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential
 to the functionality of the hardware and third-party digital
 content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue
 recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in
 accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for
 the following types of sales transactions: (i) standalone
 sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades
 and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not
 essential to the functionality of the hardware.

For the sale of most third-party products, the
 Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to
 customers because the Company establishes its own pricing for such
 products, retains related inventory risk for physical products, is
 the primary obligor to the customer and assumes the credit risk for
 amounts billed to its customers. For third-party applications sold
 through the App Store and Mac App Store and certain digital content
 sold through the iTunes Store, the Company does not determine the
 selling price of the products and is not the primary obligor to the
 customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net
 basis by recognizing in net sales only the commission it retains
 from each sale. The portion of the gross amount billed to customers
 that is remitted by the Company to third-party app developers and
 certain digital content owners is not reflected in the
 Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.



The Company records deferred revenue when it
 receives payments in advance of the delivery of products or the
 performance of services. This includes amounts that have been
 deferred for unspecified and specified software upgrade rights and
 non-software services that are attached to hardware and software
 products. The Company sells gift cards redeemable at its retail and
 online stores, and also sells gift cards redeemable on iTunes
 Store, App Store, Mac App Store and iBooks Store for the purchase
 of digital content and software. The Company records deferred
 revenue upon the sale of the card, which is relieved upon
 redemption of the card by the customer. Revenue from AppleCare
 service and support contracts is deferred and recognized over the
 service coverage periods. AppleCare service and support contracts
 typically include extended phone support, repair services,
 web-based support resources and diagnostic tools offered under the
 Company’s standard limited warranty.

The Company records reductions to revenue for
 estimated commitments related to price protection and other
 customer incentive programs. For transactions involving price
 protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated
 amount to be refunded. For the Company’s other customer
 incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is
 recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold
 the product or the date at which the program is offered. The
 Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future
 product returns based on the Company’s historical experience.
 Revenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers that are
 remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes
 recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant
 government authority.

Revenue Recognition for Arrangements with Multiple
 Deliverables

For multi-element arrangements that include
 hardware products containing software essential to the hardware
 product’s functionality, undelivered software elements that
 relate to the hardware product’s essential software, and
 undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to
 all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such
 circumstances, the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the
 selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables:
 (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value
 (“VSOE”), (ii) third-party evidence of selling
 price (“TPE”) and (iii) best estimate of selling
 price (“ESP”). VSOE generally exists only when the
 Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually
 charged by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs reflect the
 Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of
 elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone
 basis. For multi-element arrangements accounted for in accordance
 with industry specific software accounting guidance, the Company
 allocates revenue to all deliverables based on the VSOE of each
 element, and if VSOE does not exist revenue is recognized when
 elements lacking VSOE are delivered.

For sales of qualifying versions of iPhone, iPad
 and iPod touch (“iOS devices”), Mac, Apple Watch and
 Apple TV, the Company has indicated it may from time to time
 provide future unspecified software upgrades to the device’s
 essential software and/or non-software services free of charge. The
 Company has identified up to three deliverables regularly included
 in arrangements involving the sale of these devices. The first
 deliverable, which represents the substantial portion of the
 allocated sales price, is the hardware and software essential to
 the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of
 sale. The second deliverable is the embedded right included with
 qualifying devices to receive on a when-and-if-available basis,
 future unspecified software upgrades relating to the
 product’s essential software. The third deliverable is the
 non-software services to be provided to qualifying devices. The
 Company allocates revenue between these deliverables using the
 relative selling price method. Because the Company has neither VSOE
 nor TPE for these deliverables, the allocation of revenue is based
 on the Company’s ESPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered
 hardware and the related essential software is recognized at the
 time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition
 have been met. Revenue allocated to the embedded unspecified
 software upgrade rights and the non-software services is deferred
 and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period
 the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be
 provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and related
 essential software, including estimated warranty costs, are
 recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide
 non-software services are recognized as cost of sales as incurred,
 and engineering and sales and marketing costs are recognized as
 operating expenses as incurred.

The Company’s process for determining its ESP
 for deliverables without VSOE or TPE considers multiple factors
 that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances
 related to each deliverable including, where applicable, prices
 charged by the Company and market trends in the pricing for similar
 offerings, product specific business objectives, length of time a
 particular version of a device has been available, estimated cost
 to provide the non-software services and the relative ESP of the
 upgrade rights and non-software services as compared to the total
 selling price of the product.

Beginning in September 2015, the Company reduced
 the combined ESPs for iOS devices and Mac between $5 and $10 to
 reflect the increase in competitive offers for similar products at
 little to no cost for users, which reduces the amount the Company
 could reasonably charge for these deliverables on a standalone
 basis.

Shipping Costs

Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and
 handling are classified as revenue, and the Company’s
 shipping and handling costs are classified as cost of sales.



Warranty Costs

The Company generally provides for the estimated
 cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related
 revenue is recognized. The Company assesses the adequacy of its
 accrued warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary
 based on actual experience and changes in future estimates.

Software Development Costs

Research and development (“R&D”)
 costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer
 software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are subject to
 capitalization beginning when a product’s technological
 feasibility has been established and ending when a product is
 available for general release to customers. In most instances, the
 Company’s products are released soon after technological
 feasibility has been established and as a result software
 development costs were expensed as incurred.

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and
 included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
 Advertising expense was $1.8 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion
 for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Share-based Compensation

The Company recognizes expense related to
 share-based payment transactions in which it receives employee
 services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the Company
 or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the
 Company’s equity instruments or that may be settled by the
 issuance of such equity instruments. Share-based compensation cost
 for restricted stock and restricted stock units
 (“RSUs”) is measured based on the closing fair market
 value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The
 Company recognizes share-based compensation cost over the
 award’s requisite service period on a straight-line basis for
 time-based RSUs and on a graded basis for RSUs that are contingent
 on the achievement of performance conditions. The Company
 recognizes a benefit from share-based compensation in the
 Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity if an excess
 tax benefit is realized. In addition, the Company recognizes the
 indirect effects of share-based compensation on R&D tax
 credits, foreign tax credits and domestic manufacturing deductions
 in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Further information
 regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9,
 “Benefit Plans.”

Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes is computed using
 the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and
 liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences
 of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax
 bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax
 credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
 measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to
 taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets
 and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The Company
 records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the
 amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.

The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an
 uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax
 position will be sustained on examination by the taxing
 authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax
 benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions
 are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater
 than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. See Note 5,
 “Income Taxes” for additional information.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing
 income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average
 number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
 Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income available
 to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of
 common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the
 number of additional shares of common stock that would have been
 outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued.
 Potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options,
 shares to be purchased under the Company’s employee stock
 purchase plan, unvested restricted stock and unvested RSUs. The
 dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in
 diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock
 method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair
 market value of the Company’s common stock can result in a
 greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities.



The following table shows the computation of basic
 and diluted earnings per share for 2015, 2014 and 2013 (net income
 in millions and shares in thousands):



Numerator:

Net income

Denominator:

Weighted-average shares outstanding

Effect of dilutive securities

Diluted earnings per share

Potentially dilutive securities whose effect would
 have been antidilutive are excluded from the computation of diluted
 earnings per share.

Financial Instruments

Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities

All highly liquid investments with maturities of
 three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash
 equivalents. The Company’s marketable debt and equity
 securities have been classified and accounted for as 
available-for-sale.
 Management
 determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the
 time of purchase and reevaluates the classifications at each
 balance sheet date. The Company classifies its marketable debt
 securities as either short-term or long-term based on each
 instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date. Marketable
 debt securities with maturities of 12 months or less are classified
 as short-term and marketable debt securities with maturities
 greater than 12 months are classified as long-term. Marketable
 equity securities, including mutual funds, are classified as either
 short-term or long-term based on the nature of each security and
 its availability for use in current operations. The Company’s
 marketable debt and equity securities are carried at fair value,
 with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a
 component of accumulated other comprehensive income
 (“AOCI”) in shareholders’ equity, with the
 exception of unrealized losses believed to be other-than-temporary
 which are reported in earnings in the current period. The cost of
 securities sold is based upon the specific identification
 method.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company accounts for its derivative instruments
 as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value.

For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure
 to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as
 cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the
 derivative instrument is reported as a component of AOCI in
 shareholders’ equity and reclassified into earnings in the
 same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects
 earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the
 derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in earnings in the
 current period. To receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow
 hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected
 future cash flows on hedged transactions. For options designated as
 cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the
 assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in
 earnings.

For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure
 to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that
 are designated as fair value hedges, both the net gain or loss on
 the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on
 the hedged item are recognized in earnings in the current
 period.

For derivative instruments and foreign currency
 debt that hedge the exposure to changes in foreign currency
 exchange rates used for translation of the net investment in a
 foreign operation and that are designated as a net investment
 hedge, the net gain or loss on the effective portion of the
 derivative instrument is reported in the same manner as a foreign
 currency translation adjustment. For forward exchange contracts
 designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes
 in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component
 from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or
 losses related to this forward carry component are recognized in
 earnings in the current period.

Derivatives that do not qualify as hedges are
 adjusted to fair value through earnings in the current period.



Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company records its allowance for doubtful
 accounts based upon its assessment of various factors, including
 historical experience, age of the accounts receivable balances,
 credit quality of the Company’s customers, current economic
 conditions and other factors that may affect the customers’
 ability to pay.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost,
 computed using the first-in, first-out method and net realizable
 value. Any adjustments to reduce the cost of inventories to their
 net realizable value are recognized in earnings in the current
 period. As of September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014,
 the Company’s inventories consist primarily of finished
 goods.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost.
 Depreciation is computed by use of the 
straight-line
 method over the
 estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the
 lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying
 building; between one to five years for machinery and equipment,
 including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; and
 the shorter of lease terms or ten years for leasehold improvements.
 The Company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop
 internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the
 preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related to
 internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method
 over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from
 three to five years. Depreciation and amortization expense on
 property and equipment was $9.2 billion, $6.9 billion and $5.8
 billion during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired
 Intangible Assets

The Company reviews property, plant and equipment,
 inventory component prepayments and certain identifiable
 intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment. Long-lived assets
 are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
 circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be
 recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by
 comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash
 flows the assets are expected to generate. If property, plant and
 equipment, inventory component prepayments and certain identifiable
 intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be
 recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the
 assets exceeds its fair value.

The Company does not amortize goodwill and
 intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, rather such assets
 are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or
 sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
 the assets may be impaired. The Company performs its goodwill and
 intangible asset impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each
 year. The Company did not recognize any impairment charges related
 to goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets during 2015, 2014
 and 2013. The Company established reporting units based on its
 current reporting structure. For purposes of testing goodwill for
 impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to
 the extent it relates to each reporting unit. In 2015 and 2014, the
 Company’s goodwill was primarily allocated to the Americas
 and Europe reporting units.

The Company amortizes its intangible assets with
 definite useful lives over their estimated useful lives and reviews
 these assets for impairment. The Company typically amortizes its
 acquired intangible assets with definite useful lives over periods
 from three to seven years.

Fair Value Measurements

The Company applies fair value accounting for all
 financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and
 liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the
 financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair
 value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or
 paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
 market participants at the measurement date. When determining the
 fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are
 required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the
 principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would
 transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that
 market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability,
 such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer
 restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying
 the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to
 measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization
 within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is
 available and significant to the fair value measurement:

Level 1
 – Quoted prices in active markets for
 identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2
 – Observable inputs other than
 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and
 liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or
 liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are
 observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for
 substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

Level 3
 – Inputs that are generally
 unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimate of
 assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset
 or liability.



The Company’s valuation techniques used to
 measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable
 equity securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets
 for identical assets or liabilities. The valuation techniques used
 to measure the fair value of the Company’s debt instruments
 and all other financial instruments, all of which have
 counterparties with high credit ratings, were valued based on
 quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant
 inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.

In accordance with the fair value accounting
 requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible financial
 instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company has
 not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial
 instruments.

Foreign Currency Translation and Remeasurement

The Company translates the assets and liabilities
 of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S.
 dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period.
 Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using
 rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and
 losses from these translations are recognized in foreign currency
 translation included in AOCI in shareholders’ equity. The
 Company’s subsidiaries that use the U.S. dollar as their
 functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at
 exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and
 inventories, property and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at
 historical rates.

The entire disclosure for the basis of presentation and significant accounting policies concepts. Basis of presentation describes the underlying basis used to prepare the financial statements (for example, US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Other Comprehensive Basis of Accounting, IFRS).  Accounting policies describe all significant accounting policies of the reporting entity.

Investments in debt and equity securities which are categorized neither as held-to-maturity nor trading and which are intended to be sold or mature more than one year from the balance sheet date or operating cycle, if longer. Such securities are reported at fair value; unrealized gains (losses) related to Available-for-sale Securities are excluded from earnings and reported in a separate component of shareholders' equity (other comprehensive income), unless the Available-for-sale security is designated as a hedge or is determined to have had an other than temporary decline in fair value below its amortized cost basis. All or a portion of the unrealized holding gain (loss) of an Available-for-sale security that is designated as being hedged in a fair value hedge is recognized in earnings during the period of the hedge, as are other than temporary declines in fair value below the cost basis for investments in equity securities and debt securities that an entity intends to sell or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell before the recovery of its amortized cost basis. Other than temporary declines in fair value below the cost basis for debt securities categorized as Available-for-sale that an entity does not intend to sell and for which it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell before the recovery of its amortized cost basis are bifurcated into credit losses and losses related to all other factors. Other than temporary declines in fair value below cost basis related to credit losses are recognized in earnings, and losses related to all other factors are recognized in other comprehensive income.

Note 9 – Benefit Plans

2014 Employee Stock Plan

In the second quarter of 2014, shareholders
 approved the 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”)
 and terminated the Company’s authority to grant new awards
 under the 2003 Employee Stock Plan (the “2003 Plan”).
 The 2014 Plan provides for broad-based equity grants to employees,
 including executive officers, and permits the granting of RSUs,
 stock grants, performance-based awards, stock options and stock
 appreciation rights, as well as cash bonus awards. RSUs granted
 under the 2014 Plan generally vest over four years, based on
 continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the
 Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis. Each share
 issued with respect to RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan reduces the
 number of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares.
 RSUs cancelled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding
 obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under
 the 2014 Plan utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs
 cancelled or shares withheld. Currently, all RSUs granted under the
 2014 Plan have dividend equivalent rights (“DERs”),
 which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share
 as holders of common stock. DERs are subject to the same vesting
 and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs.
 DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. Upon
 approval of the 2014 Plan, the Company reserved 385 million
 shares plus the number of shares remaining that were reserved but
 not issued under the 2003 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding
 awards under the 2003 Plan that expire, are cancelled or otherwise
 terminate, or are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations
 with respect to RSUs, will also be available for awards under the
 2014 Plan. As of September 26, 2015, approximately
 442.9 million shares were reserved for future issuance under
 the 2014 Plan.

2003 Employee Stock Plan

The 2003 Plan is a shareholder approved plan that
 provided for broad-based equity grants to employees, including
 executive officers. The 2003 Plan permitted the granting of
 incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, RSUs, stock
 appreciation rights, stock purchase rights and performance-based
 awards. Options granted under the 2003 Plan generally expire seven
 to ten years after the grant date and generally become exercisable
 over a period of four years, based on continued employment, with
 either annual, semi-annual or quarterly vesting. RSUs granted under
 the 2003 Plan generally vest over two to four years, based on
 continued employment and are settled upon vesting in shares of the
 Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis. All RSUs,
 other than RSUs held by the Chief Executive Officer, granted under
 the 2003 Plan have DERs. DERs are subject to the same vesting and
 other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs
 are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. In the
 second quarter of 2014, the Company terminated the authority to
 grant new awards under the 2003 Plan.

1997 Director Stock Plan

The 1997 Director Stock Plan (the “Director
 Plan”) is a shareholder approved plan that (i) permits
 the Company to grant awards of RSUs or stock options to the
 Company’s non-employee directors, (ii) provides for
 automatic initial grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director
 joining the Board of Directors and automatic annual grants of RSUs
 at each annual meeting of shareholders, and (iii) permits the
 Board of Directors to prospectively change the relative mixture of
 stock options and RSUs for the initial and annual award grants and
 the methodology for determining the number of shares of the
 Company’s common stock subject to these grants without
 shareholder approval. Each share issued with respect to RSUs
 granted under the Director Plan reduces the number of shares
 available for grant under the plan by two shares. The Director Plan
 expires November 9, 2019. All RSUs granted under the Director
 Plan are entitled to DERs. DERs are subject to the same vesting and
 other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs
 are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. As of
 September 26, 2015, approximately 1.2 million shares were
 reserved for future issuance under the Director Plan.

Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans

During the fourth quarter of 2015, Section 16
 officers Timothy D. Cook, Angela Ahrendts, Luca Maestri, Daniel
 Riccio, Philip Schiller and Jeffrey Williams had equity trading
 plans in place in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the
 Exchange Act. An equity trading plan is a written document that
 pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for
 determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or
 sales of the Company’s stock, including shares acquired
 pursuant to the Company’s employee and director equity
 plans.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
 “Purchase Plan”) is a shareholder approved plan under
 which substantially all employees may purchase the Company’s
 common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of
 the lower of the fair market values of the stock as of the
 beginning or the end of six-month offering periods. An
 employee’s payroll deductions under the Purchase Plan are
 limited to 10% of the employee’s compensation and employees
 may not purchase more than $25,000 of stock during any calendar
 year. As of September 26, 2015, approximately
 53.0 million shares were reserved for future issuance under
 the Purchase Plan.



401(k) Plan

The Company’s 401(k) Plan is a deferred
 salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal
 Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, participating U.S. employees
 may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the IRS annual
 contribution limit ($18,000 for calendar year 2015). The Company
 matches 50% to 100% of each employee’s contributions,
 depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the
 employee’s eligible earnings. The Company’s matching
 contributions to the 401(k) Plan were $200 million, $163 million
 and $135 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Restricted Stock Units

A summary of the Company’s RSU activity and
 related information for 2015, 2014 and 2013, is as follows:



Balance at September 29, 2012

RSUs granted

RSUs vested

RSUs cancelled





Balance at September 28, 2013

RSUs granted

RSUs vested

RSUs cancelled





Balance at September 27, 2014

RSUs granted

RSUs vested

RSUs cancelled





Balance at September 26, 2015





The fair value as of the respective vesting dates
 of RSUs was $4.8 billion, $3.4 billion and $3.1 billion for 2015,
 2014 and 2013, respectively. The majority of RSUs that vested in
 2015, 2014 and 2013 were net-share settled such that the Company
 withheld shares with value equivalent to the employees’
 minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other
 employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing
 authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately
 14.1 million, 15.6 million and 15.5 million for
 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and were based on the value of
 the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the
 Company’s closing stock price. Total payments for the
 employees’ tax obligations to taxing authorities were $1.6
 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion in 2015, 2014 and 2013,
 respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within the
 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These net-share
 settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the Company as
 they reduced the number of shares that would have otherwise been
 issued as a result of the vesting and did not represent an expense
 to the Company.

Stock Options

The Company had 1.2 million stock options
 outstanding as of September 26, 2015, with a weighted-average
 exercise price per share of $15.08 and weighted-average remaining
 contractual term of 4.1 years, substantially all of which are
 exercisable. The aggregate intrinsic value of the stock options
 outstanding as of September 26, 2015 was $120 million, which
 represents the value of the Company’s closing stock price on
 the last trading day of the period in excess of the
 weighted-average exercise price multiplied by the number of options
 outstanding. Total intrinsic value of options at time of exercise
 was $479 million, $1.5 billion and $1.0 billion for 2015, 2014 and
 2013, respectively.



Share-based Compensation

The following table shows a summary of the
 share-based compensation expense included in the Consolidated
 Statements of Operations for 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in millions):



Cost of sales

Research and development

Selling, general and administrative













Total share-based compensation expense













The income tax benefit related to share-based
 compensation expense was $1.2 billion, $1.0 billion and $816
 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. As of
 September 26, 2015, the total unrecognized compensation cost
 related to outstanding stock options, RSUs and restricted stock was
 $6.8 billion, which the Company expects to recognize over a
 weighted-average period of 2.7 years.

Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies

Accrued Warranty and Indemnification

The following table shows changes in the
 Company’s accrued warranties and related costs for 2015, 2014
 and 2013 (in millions):



Beginning accrued warranty and related costs

Cost of warranty claims

Accruals for product warranty













Ending accrued warranty and related costs













The Company generally does not indemnify end-users
 of its operating system and application software against legal
 claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual
 property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company
 sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the
 Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an
 infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified
 third-party. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a
 reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material
 loss with respect to indemnification of end-users of its operating
 system or application software for infringement of third-party
 intellectual property rights. The Company did not record a
 liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of
 September 26, 2015 or September 27, 2014.

In September 2015, the Company introduced the
 iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who
 purchase an iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in one of its U.S. physical
 retail stores and activate the purchased iPhone with one of the
 four national carriers. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides
 customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a new iPhone,
 provided certain conditions are met. One of the conditions of this
 program requires the customer to finance the initial purchase price
 of the iPhone with a third-party lender. Upon exercise of the
 trade-in right and purchase of a new iPhone, the Company satisfies
 the customer’s outstanding balance due to the third-party
 lender on the original device. The Company accounts for the
 trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement
 revenue net of the fair value of such right with subsequent changes
 to the guarantee liability recognized within revenue.

The Company has entered into indemnification
 agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these
 agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to
 the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise
 by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance
 expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related
 legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum
 potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make
 under these agreements due to the limited history of prior
 indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances
 involved in each claim. However, the Company maintains directors
 and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to
 such obligations.

Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials
 and Product

Although most components essential to the
 Company’s business are generally available from multiple
 sources, a number of components are currently obtained from single
 or limited sources. In addition, the Company competes for various
 components with other participants in the markets for mobile
 communication and media devices and personal computers. Therefore,
 many components used by the Company, including those that are
 available from multiple sources, are at times subject to
 industry-wide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that
 could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial
 condition and operating results.



The Company uses some custom components that are
 not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced
 by the Company often utilize custom components available from only
 one source. When a component or product uses new technologies,
 initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’
 yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the
 Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product
 were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed
 shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s
 financial condition and operating results could be materially
 adversely affected. The Company’s business and financial
 performance could also be materially adversely affected depending
 on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the
 original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities
 from an alternative source. Continued availability of these
 components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if
 those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components
 instead of components customized to meet the Company’s
 requirements.

The Company has entered into agreements for the
 supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that
 the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on
 similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to
 significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that
 could materially adversely affect its financial condition and
 operating results.

Substantially all of the Company’s hardware
 products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located
 primarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this
 manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of
 outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these
 outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced suppliers of components
 and manufacturers for many of the Company’s products.
 Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on
 manufacturing schedules, the Company’s operating results
 could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable
 to meet their production commitments. The Company’s purchase
 commitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150
 days.

Other Off-Balance Sheet Commitments

Operating Leases

The Company leases various equipment and
 facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating
 lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any
 other off-balance sheet financing arrangements. The major facility
 leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally
 contain multi-year renewal options. As of September 26, 2015,
 the Company had a total of 463 retail stores. Leases for retail
 space are for terms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of
 which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal
 options. As of September 26, 2015, the Company’s total
 future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases
 were $6.3 billion, of which $3.6 billion related to leases for
 retail space.

Rent expense under all operating leases, including
 both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $794 million, $717
 million and $645 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
 Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases
 having remaining terms in excess of one year as of
 September 26, 2015, are as follows (in millions):



2016

Other Commitments

The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners
 to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company’s products and
 to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. These
 outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on
 demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers
 periods up to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual
 components for its products from a wide variety of individual
 suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires
 components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier
 contracts and open orders based on projected demand information.
 Where appropriate, the purchases are applied
 to inventory component prepayments that
 are outstanding with the respective supplier. As of
 September 26, 2015, the Company had outstanding off-balance
 sheet third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase
 commitments of $29.5 billion.



In addition to the commitments mentioned above, the
 Company had other off-balance sheet obligations of $7.3 billion as
 of September 26, 2015 that consisted of commitments to acquire
 capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process
 equipment, and commitments related to inventory prepayments,
 advertising, licensing, R&D, internet and telecommunications
 services, energy and other obligations.

Contingencies

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings
 and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and
 that have not been fully adjudicated, certain of which are
 discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the
 heading “Risk Factors” and in Part I, Item 3 of
 this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings.”
 In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable
 possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a
 material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss
 contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. However, the
 outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, although
 management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be
 remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against
 the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of
 management’s expectations, the Company’s consolidated
 financial statements for that reporting period could be materially
 adversely affected.

Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd, et al.

On August 24, 2012, a jury returned a verdict
 awarding the Company $1.05 billion in its lawsuit against Samsung
 Electronics Co., Ltd and affiliated parties in the United States
 District Court, Northern District of California, San Jose Division.
 On March 6, 2014, the District Court entered final judgment in
 favor of the Company in the amount of approximately $930
 million. On May 18, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for
 the Federal Circuit affirmed in part, and reversed in part, the
 decision of the District Court. As a result, the Court of Appeals
 ordered entry of final judgment on damages in the amount of
 approximately $548 million, with the District Court to determine
 supplemental damages and interest, as well as damages owed for
 products subject to the reversal in part. Because the ruling
 remains subject to further proceedings, the Company has not
 recognized the award in its results of operations.

The entire disclosure for commitments and contingencies.

Note 4 – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

On July 31, 2014, the Company completed the
 acquisitions of Beats Music, LLC, which offers a subscription
 streaming music service, and Beats Electronics, LLC, which makes
 Beats
®

 headphones, speakers and audio software (collectively,
 “Beats”). The total purchase price consideration for
 these acquisitions was $2.6 billion, which consisted primarily of
 cash, of which $2.2 billion was allocated to goodwill, $636 million
 to acquired intangible assets and $258 million to net liabilities
 assumed. Concurrent with the close of the acquisitions, the Company
 repaid $295 million of existing Beats outstanding debt to
 third-party creditors. In conjunction with the Beats acquisitions,
 the Company issued approximately 5.1 million shares of its
 common stock to certain former equity holders of Beats. The
 restricted stock was valued at approximately $485 million based on
 the Company’s common stock on the acquisition date. The
 majority of these shares, valued at approximately $417 million,
 will vest over time based on continued employment with Apple.

The Company also completed various other business
 acquisitions during 2014 for an aggregate cash consideration, net
 of cash acquired, of $957 million, of which $828 million was
 allocated to goodwill, $257 million to acquired intangible assets
 and $128 million to net liabilities assumed.

The Company’s acquired intangible assets
 with definite useful lives primarily consist of patents and
 licenses and are amortized over periods typically from three to
 seven years. The following table summarizes the components of gross
 and net intangible asset balances as of September 26, 2015 and
 September 27, 2014 (in millions):

 assets was $1.3 billion, $1.1 billion and $960 million in 2015,
 2014 and 2013, respectively. As of September 26, 2015, the
 remaining weighted-average amortization period for acquired
 intangible assets is 3.6 years. The expected annual amortization
 expense related to acquired intangible assets as of

Note 11 – Segment Information and Geographic Data

The Company reports segment information based on
 the “management” approach. The management approach
 designates the internal reporting used by management for making
 decisions and assessing performance as the source of the
 Company’s reportable operating segments.

The Company manages its business primarily on a
 geographic basis. The Company’s reportable operating segments
 consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of
 Asia Pacific. The Americas segment includes both North and South
 America. The Europe segment includes European countries, as well as
 India, the Middle East and Africa. The Greater China segment
 includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The Rest of Asia Pacific
 segment includes Australia and those Asian countries not included
 in the Company’s other reportable operating segments.
 Although each reportable operating segment provides similar
 hardware and software products and similar services, they are
 managed separately to better align with the location of the
 Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique
 market dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting policies
 of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1,
 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”

The Company evaluates the performance of its
 reportable operating segments based on net sales and operating
 income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on
 the location of customers and sales through the Company’s
 retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating
 income for each segment includes net sales to third parties,
 related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable
 to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the
 geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred.
 Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense
 and certain expenses managed outside the reportable operating
 segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include
 various corporate expenses such as R&D, corporate marketing
 expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes,
 various nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general
 and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany
 transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.



The following table shows information by reportable
 operating segment for 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in millions):

Share Repurchase Program

In the third quarter of 2015, the Company’s
 Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization to
 $140 billion of the Company’s common stock, of which $104
 billion had been utilized as of September 26, 2015. The
 Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to
 acquire any specific number of shares. Under the program, shares
 may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market
 transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1
 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
 “Exchange Act”).

The Company has entered, and in the future may
 enter, into accelerated share repurchase arrangements
 (“ASRs”) with financial institutions. In exchange for
 up-front payments, the financial institutions deliver shares of the
 Company’s common stock during the purchase periods of each
 ASR. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore
 the average repurchase price paid per share, is determined at the
 end of the applicable purchase period of each ASR based on the
 volume weighted-average price of the Company’s common stock
 during that period. The shares received are retired in the periods
 they are delivered, and the up-front payments are accounted for as
 a reduction to shareholders’ equity in the Company’s
 Consolidated Balance Sheets in the periods the payments are made.
 The Company reflects the ASRs as a repurchase of common stock in
 the period delivered for purposes of calculating earnings per share
 and as forward contracts indexed to its own common stock. The ASRs
 met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification, and
 therefore were not accounted for as derivative instruments.

The following table shows the Company’s ASR
 activity and related information during the years ended
 September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014:



May 2015 ASR

August 2014 ASR

January 2014 ASR

April 2013 ASR



Includes 38.3 million shares delivered and retired at the
 beginning of the purchase period, which began in the third quarter
 of 2015 and 10.0 million shares delivered and retired at the
 end of the purchase period, which concluded in the fourth quarter
 of 2015.



Includes 59.9 million shares delivered and retired at the
 beginning of the purchase period, which began in the fourth quarter
 of 2014, 8.3 million net shares delivered and retired in the
 first quarter of 2015 and 13.3 million shares delivered and
 retired at the end of the purchase period, which concluded in the
 second quarter of 2015.

Additionally, the Company repurchased shares of its
 common stock in the open market, which were retired upon
 repurchase, during the periods presented as follows:

Note 5 – Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes for 2015, 2014 and
 2013, consisted of the following (in millions):



Federal:

Current

Deferred

























State:

Current

Deferred

























Foreign:

Current

Deferred

























Provision for income taxes













The foreign provision for income taxes is based on
 foreign pre-tax earnings of $47.6 billion, $33.6 billion and $30.5
 billion in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Company’s
 consolidated financial statements provide for any related tax
 liability on undistributed earnings that the Company does not
 intend to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Substantially
 all of the Company’s undistributed international earnings
 intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the
 U.S. were generated by subsidiaries organized in Ireland, which has
 a statutory tax rate of 12.5%. As of September 26, 2015, U.S.
 income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $91.5
 billion of such earnings. The amount of unrecognized deferred tax
 liability related to these temporary differences is estimated to be
 $30.0 billion.

As of September 26, 2015 and
 September 27, 2014, $186.9 billion and $137.1 billion,
 respectively, of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and
 marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are
 generally based in U.S. 
dollar-denominated
 holdings. Amounts
 held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income
 taxation on repatriation to the U.S.

A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes,
 with the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income
 tax rate (35% in 2015, 2014 and 2013) to income before provision
 for income taxes for 2015, 2014 and 2013, is as follows (dollars in
 millions):



Computed expected tax

State taxes, net of federal effect

Indefinitely invested earnings of foreign subsidiaries

Domestic production activities deduction

Research and development credit, net

Other













Provision for income taxes













Effective tax rate

The Company’s income taxes payable have been
 reduced by the tax benefits from employee stock plan awards. For
 stock options, the Company receives an income tax benefit
 calculated as the tax effect of the difference between the fair
 market value of the stock issued at the time of the exercise and
 the exercise price. For RSUs, the Company receives an income
 tax benefit upon the award’s vesting equal to the tax effect
 of the underlying stock’s fair market value. The Company had
 net excess tax benefits from equity awards of $748 million, $706
 million and $643 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively,
 which were reflected as increases to common stock.



As of September 26, 2015 and
 September 27, 2014, the significant components of the
 Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in
 millions):



Deferred tax assets:

Accrued liabilities and other reserves

Basis of capital assets and investments

Deferred revenue

Deferred cost sharing

Share-based compensation

Unrealized losses

Other









Total deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance of $0









Deferred tax liabilities:

Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries

Other









Total deferred tax liabilities









Net deferred tax liabilities









Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the
 effects of tax losses, credits and the future income tax effects of
 temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement
 carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
 respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that
 apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
 differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

Uncertain Tax Positions

Tax positions are evaluated in a two-step process.
 The Company first determines whether it is more likely than not
 that a tax position will be sustained upon examination. If a tax
 position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold it is
 then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in
 the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the
 largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being
 realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company classifies gross
 interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not
 expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as
 non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

As of September 26, 2015, the total amount of
 gross unrecognized tax benefits was $6.9 billion, of which $2.5
 billion, if recognized, would affect the Company’s effective
 tax rate. As of September 27, 2014, the total amount of gross
 unrecognized tax benefits was $4.0 billion, of which $1.4 billion,
 if recognized, would affect the Company’s effective tax
 rate.

The aggregate changes in the balance of gross
 unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties,
 for 2015, 2014 and 2013, is as follows (in millions):



Beginning Balance

Increases related to tax positions taken during a prior year

Decreases related to tax positions taken during a prior year

Increases related to tax positions taken during the current
 year

Decreases related to settlements with taxing authorities

Decreases related to expiration of statute of limitations













Ending Balance













The Company includes interest and penalties related
 to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes.
 As of September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014, the
 total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $1.3
 billion and $630 million, respectively, which is classified as
 non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In
 connection with tax matters, the Company recognized interest and
 penalty expense in 2015, 2014 and 2013 of $709 million, $40 million
 and $189 million, respectively.



The Company is subject to taxation and files income
 tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and
 foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the
 “IRS”) is currently examining the years 2010 through
 2012, and all years prior to 2010 are closed. In addition, the
 Company is subject to audits by state, local and foreign tax
 authorities. In major states and major foreign jurisdictions,
 the years subsequent to 2003 generally remain open and could be
 subject to examination by the taxing authorities.

Management believes that an adequate provision has
 been made for any adjustments that may result from tax
 examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be
 predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the
 Company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent
 with management’s expectations, the Company could be required
 to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such
 resolution occurs. Although timing of the resolution and/or closure
 of audits is not certain, the Company does not believe it is
 reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits would
 materially change in the next 12 months.

On June 11, 2014, the European Commission
 issued an opening decision initiating a formal investigation
 against Ireland for alleged state aid to the Company. The opening
 decision concerns the allocation of profits for taxation purposes
 of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company. The
 Company believes the European Commission’s assertions are
 without merit. If the European Commission were to conclude against
 Ireland, the European Commission could require Ireland to recover
 from the Company past taxes covering a period of up to 10 years
 reflective of the disallowed state aid. While such amount could be
 material, as of September 26, 2015 the Company is unable to
 estimate the impact.

The entire disclosure for income taxes. Disclosures may include net deferred tax liability or asset recognized in an enterprise's statement of financial position, net change during the year in the total valuation allowance, approximate tax effect of each type of temporary difference and carryforward that gives rise to a significant portion of deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets, utilization of a tax carryback, and tax uncertainties information.

 2015 and maturing in 2017, 2020, 2022 and 2025, the Company entered
 into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $4.3
 billion. These interest rate swaps effectively converted the fixed
 interest rates on the U.S. dollar-denominated notes to a floating
 interest rate.

As of September 26, 2015, ¥250.0 billion
 of the Japanese yen-denominated notes was designated as a hedge of
 the foreign currency exposure of its net investment in a foreign
 operation. The foreign currency transaction gain or loss on the
 Japanese yen-denominated debt designated as a hedge is recorded in
 OCI as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. As of
 September 26, 2015, the carrying value of the debt designated
 as a net investment hedge was $2.1 billion.

For further discussion regarding the
 Company’s use of derivative instruments see the Derivative
 Financial Instruments section of Note 2, “Financial
 Instruments.”

The effective interest rates for the Notes include
 the interest on the Notes, amortization of the discount and, if
 applicable, adjustments related to hedging. The Company recognized
 $722 million, $381 million and $136 million of interest expense on
 its term debt for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

The future principal payments for the
 Company’s Notes as of September 26, 2015 are as follows
 (in millions):

As of September 26, 2015 and
 September 27, 2014, the fair value of the Company’s
 Notes, based on Level 2 inputs, was $54.9 billion and $28.5
 billion, respectively.

Note 8 – Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income consists of two components,
 net income and OCI. OCI refers to revenue, expenses, and gains and
 losses that under GAAP are recorded as an element of
 shareholders’ equity but are excluded from net income. The
 Company’s OCI consists of foreign currency translation
 adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as
 their functional currency, net deferred gains and losses on certain
 derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges and
 unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities classified as
 available-for-sale.

The following table shows the pre-tax amounts
 reclassified from AOCI into the Consolidated Statements of
 Operations, and the associated financial statement line item, for
 2015 and 2014 (in millions):

Basis of Presentation and Preparation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
 include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and
 transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the
 Company’s management, the consolidated financial statements
 reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature,
 necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The
 preparation of these consolidated financial statements in
 conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
 (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and
 assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated
 financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could
 differ materially from those estimates.

The Company’s fiscal year is the 52 or
 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The
 Company’s fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 ended on
 September 26, 2015, September 27, 2014 and
 September 28, 2013, respectively. An additional week is
 included in the first fiscal quarter approximately every six years
 to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Fiscal years
 2015, 2014 and 2013 each spanned 52 weeks. Unless otherwise stated,
 references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer
 to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the
 associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.

Revenue Recognition

Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the
 sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications,
 accessories, and service and support contracts. The Company
 recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
 exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or
 determinable and collection is probable. Product is considered
 delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title, risk
 of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. For most of
 the Company’s product sales, these criteria are met at the
 time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for
 some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain
 other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives
 the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of
 loss on these sales during transit. For payment terms in excess of
 the Company’s standard payment terms, revenue is recognized
 as payments become due unless the Company has positive evidence
 that the sales price is fixed or determinable, such as a successful
 history of collection, without concession, on comparable
 arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of
 hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential
 to the functionality of the hardware and third-party digital
 content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue
 recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in
 accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for
 the following types of sales transactions: (i) standalone
 sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades
 and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not
 essential to the functionality of the hardware.

For the sale of most third-party products, the
 Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to
 customers because the Company establishes its own pricing for such
 products, retains related inventory risk for physical products, is
 the primary obligor to the customer and assumes the credit risk for
 amounts billed to its customers. For third-party applications sold
 through the App Store and Mac App Store and certain digital content
 sold through the iTunes Store, the Company does not determine the
 selling price of the products and is not the primary obligor to the
 customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net
 basis by recognizing in net sales only the commission it retains
 from each sale. The portion of the gross amount billed to customers
 that is remitted by the Company to third-party app developers and
 certain digital content owners is not reflected in the
 Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.



The Company records deferred revenue when it
 receives payments in advance of the delivery of products or the
 performance of services. This includes amounts that have been
 deferred for unspecified and specified software upgrade rights and
 non-software services that are attached to hardware and software
 products. The Company sells gift cards redeemable at its retail and
 online stores, and also sells gift cards redeemable on iTunes
 Store, App Store, Mac App Store and iBooks Store for the purchase
 of digital content and software. The Company records deferred
 revenue upon the sale of the card, which is relieved upon
 redemption of the card by the customer. Revenue from AppleCare
 service and support contracts is deferred and recognized over the
 service coverage periods. AppleCare service and support contracts
 typically include extended phone support, repair services,
 web-based support resources and diagnostic tools offered under the
 Company’s standard limited warranty.

The Company records reductions to revenue for
 estimated commitments related to price protection and other
 customer incentive programs. For transactions involving price
 protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated
 amount to be refunded. For the Company’s other customer
 incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is
 recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold
 the product or the date at which the program is offered. The
 Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future
 product returns based on the Company’s historical experience.
 Revenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers that are
 remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes
 recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant
 government authority.

Revenue Recognition for Arrangements with Multiple
 Deliverables

For multi-element arrangements that include
 hardware products containing software essential to the hardware
 product’s functionality, undelivered software elements that
 relate to the hardware product’s essential software, and
 undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to
 all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such
 circumstances, the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the
 selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables:
 (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value
 (“VSOE”), (ii) third-party evidence of selling
 price (“TPE”) and (iii) best estimate of selling
 price (“ESP”). VSOE generally exists only when the
 Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually
 charged by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs reflect the
 Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of
 elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone
 basis. For multi-element arrangements accounted for in accordance
 with industry specific software accounting guidance, the Company
 allocates revenue to all deliverables based on the VSOE of each
 element, and if VSOE does not exist revenue is recognized when
 elements lacking VSOE are delivered.

For sales of qualifying versions of iPhone, iPad
 and iPod touch (“iOS devices”), Mac, Apple Watch and
 Apple TV, the Company has indicated it may from time to time
 provide future unspecified software upgrades to the device’s
 essential software and/or non-software services free of charge. The
 Company has identified up to three deliverables regularly included
 in arrangements involving the sale of these devices. The first
 deliverable, which represents the substantial portion of the
 allocated sales price, is the hardware and software essential to
 the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of
 sale. The second deliverable is the embedded right included with
 qualifying devices to receive on a when-and-if-available basis,
 future unspecified software upgrades relating to the
 product’s essential software. The third deliverable is the
 non-software services to be provided to qualifying devices. The
 Company allocates revenue between these deliverables using the
 relative selling price method. Because the Company has neither VSOE
 nor TPE for these deliverables, the allocation of revenue is based
 on the Company’s ESPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered
 hardware and the related essential software is recognized at the
 time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition
 have been met. Revenue allocated to the embedded unspecified
 software upgrade rights and the non-software services is deferred
 and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period
 the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be
 provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and related
 essential software, including estimated warranty costs, are
 recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide
 non-software services are recognized as cost of sales as incurred,
 and engineering and sales and marketing costs are recognized as
 operating expenses as incurred.

The Company’s process for determining its ESP
 for deliverables without VSOE or TPE considers multiple factors
 that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances
 related to each deliverable including, where applicable, prices
 charged by the Company and market trends in the pricing for similar
 offerings, product specific business objectives, length of time a
 particular version of a device has been available, estimated cost
 to provide the non-software services and the relative ESP of the
 upgrade rights and non-software services as compared to the total
 selling price of the product.

Beginning in September 2015, the Company reduced
 the combined ESPs for iOS devices and Mac between $5 and $10 to
 reflect the increase in competitive offers for similar products at
 little to no cost for users, which reduces the amount the Company
 could reasonably charge for these deliverables on a standalone
 basis.

Shipping Costs

Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and
 handling are classified as revenue, and the Company’s
 shipping and handling costs are classified as cost of sales.

Warranty Costs

The Company generally provides for the estimated
 cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related
 revenue is recognized. The Company assesses the adequacy of its
 accrued warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary
 based on actual experience and changes in future estimates.

Software Development Costs

Research and development (“R&D”)
 costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer
 software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are subject to
 capitalization beginning when a product’s technological
 feasibility has been established and ending when a product is
 available for general release to customers. In most instances, the
 Company’s products are released soon after technological
 feasibility has been established and as a result software
 development costs were expensed as incurred.

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and
 included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
 Advertising expense was $1.8 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion
 for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Share-based Compensation

The Company recognizes expense related to
 share-based payment transactions in which it receives employee
 services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the Company
 or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the
 Company’s equity instruments or that may be settled by the
 issuance of such equity instruments. Share-based compensation cost
 for restricted stock and restricted stock units
 (“RSUs”) is measured based on the closing fair market
 value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The
 Company recognizes share-based compensation cost over the
 award’s requisite service period on a straight-line basis for
 time-based RSUs and on a graded basis for RSUs that are contingent
 on the achievement of performance conditions. The Company
 recognizes a benefit from share-based compensation in the
 Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity if an excess
 tax benefit is realized. In addition, the Company recognizes the
 indirect effects of share-based compensation on R&D tax
 credits, foreign tax credits and domestic manufacturing deductions
 in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Further information
 regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9,
 “Benefit Plans.”

Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes is computed using
 the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and
 liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences
 of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax
 bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax
 credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
 measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to
 taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets
 and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The Company
 records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the
 amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.

The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an
 uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax
 position will be sustained on examination by the taxing
 authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax
 benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions
 are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater
 than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. See Note 5,
 “Income Taxes” for additional information.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing
 income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average
 number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
 Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income available
 to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of
 common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the
 number of additional shares of common stock that would have been
 outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued.
 Potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options,
 shares to be purchased under the Company’s employee stock
 purchase plan, unvested restricted stock and unvested RSUs. The
 dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in
 diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock
 method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair
 market value of the Company’s common stock can result in a
 greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities.



The following table shows the computation of basic
 and diluted earnings per share for 2015, 2014 and 2013 (net income
 in millions and shares in thousands):



Numerator:

Net income

Denominator:

Weighted-average shares outstanding

Effect of dilutive securities













Weighted-average diluted shares

Diluted earnings per share

Potentially dilutive securities whose effect would
 have been antidilutive are excluded from the computation of diluted
 earnings per share.

Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities

All highly liquid investments with maturities of
 three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash
 equivalents. The Company’s marketable debt and equity
 securities have been classified and accounted for as 
available-for-sale.
 Management
 determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the
 time of purchase and reevaluates the classifications at each
 balance sheet date. The Company classifies its marketable debt
 securities as either short-term or long-term based on each
 instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date. Marketable
 debt securities with maturities of 12 months or less are classified
 as short-term and marketable debt securities with maturities
 greater than 12 months are classified as long-term. Marketable
 equity securities, including mutual funds, are classified as either
 short-term or long-term based on the nature of each security and
 its availability for use in current operations. The Company’s
 marketable debt and equity securities are carried at fair value,
 with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a
 component of accumulated other comprehensive income
 (“AOCI”) in shareholders’ equity, with the
 exception of unrealized losses believed to be other-than-temporary
 which are reported in earnings in the current period. The cost of
 securities sold is based upon the specific identification
 method.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company accounts for its derivative instruments
 as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value.

For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure
 to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as
 cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the
 derivative instrument is reported as a component of AOCI in
 shareholders’ equity and reclassified into earnings in the
 same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects
 earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the
 derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in earnings in the
 current period. To receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow
 hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected
 future cash flows on hedged transactions. For options designated as
 cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the
 assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in
 earnings.

For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure
 to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that
 are designated as fair value hedges, both the net gain or loss on
 the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on
 the hedged item are recognized in earnings in the current
 period.

For derivative instruments and foreign currency
 debt that hedge the exposure to changes in foreign currency
 exchange rates used for translation of the net investment in a
 foreign operation and that are designated as a net investment
 hedge, the net gain or loss on the effective portion of the
 derivative instrument is reported in the same manner as a foreign
 currency translation adjustment. For forward exchange contracts
 designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes
 in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component
 from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or
 losses related to this forward carry component are recognized in
 earnings in the current period.

Derivatives that do not qualify as hedges are
 adjusted to fair value through earnings in the current period.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company records its allowance for doubtful
 accounts based upon its assessment of various factors, including
 historical experience, age of the accounts receivable balances,
 credit quality of the Company’s customers, current economic
 conditions and other factors that may affect the customers’
 ability to pay.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost,
 computed using the first-in, first-out method and net realizable
 value. Any adjustments to reduce the cost of inventories to their
 net realizable value are recognized in earnings in the current
 period. As of September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014,
 the Company’s inventories consist primarily of finished
 goods.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost.
 Depreciation is computed by use of the 
straight-line
 method over the estimated
 useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 30
 years or the remaining life of the underlying building; between one
 to five years for machinery and equipment, including product
 tooling and manufacturing process equipment; and the shorter of
 lease terms or ten years for leasehold improvements. The Company
 capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use
 software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project
 stage. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are
 amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful
 lives of the assets, which range from three to five years.
 Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was
 $9.2 billion, $6.9 billion and $5.8 billion during 2015, 2014 and
 2013, respectively.

Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired
 Intangible Assets

The Company reviews property, plant and equipment,
 inventory component prepayments and certain identifiable
 intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment. Long-lived assets
 are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
 circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be
 recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by
 comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash
 flows the assets are expected to generate. If property, plant and
 equipment, inventory component prepayments and certain identifiable
 intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be
 recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the
 assets exceeds its fair value.

The Company does not amortize goodwill and
 intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, rather such assets
 are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or
 sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
 the assets may be impaired. The Company performs its goodwill and
 intangible asset impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each
 year. The Company did not recognize any impairment charges related
 to goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets during 2015, 2014
 and 2013. The Company established reporting units based on its
 current reporting structure. For purposes of testing goodwill for
 impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to
 the extent it relates to each reporting unit. In 2015 and 2014, the
 Company’s goodwill was primarily allocated to the Americas
 and Europe reporting units.

The Company amortizes its intangible assets with
 definite useful lives over their estimated useful lives and reviews
 these assets for impairment. The Company typically amortizes its
 acquired intangible assets with definite useful lives over periods
 from three to seven years.

Fair Value Measurements

The Company applies fair value accounting for all
 financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and
 liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the
 financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair
 value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or
 paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
 market participants at the measurement date. When determining the
 fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are
 required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the
 principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would
 transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that
 market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability,
 such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer
 restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying
 the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to
 measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization
 within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is
 available and significant to the fair value measurement:

Level 1
 – Quoted prices in active markets for
 identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2
 – Observable inputs other than
 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and
 liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or
 liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are
 observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for
 substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

Level 3
 – Inputs that are generally
 unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimate of
 assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset
 or liability.



The Company’s valuation techniques used to
 measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable
 equity securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets
 for identical assets or liabilities. The valuation techniques used
 to measure the fair value of the Company’s debt instruments
 and all other financial instruments, all of which have
 counterparties with high credit ratings, were valued based on
 quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant
 inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.

In accordance with the fair value accounting
 requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible financial
 instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company has
 not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial
 instruments.

Foreign Currency Translation and Remeasurement

The Company translates the assets and liabilities
 of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S.
 dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period.
 Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using
 rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and
 losses from these translations are recognized in foreign currency
 translation included in AOCI in shareholders’ equity. The
 Company’s subsidiaries that use the U.S. dollar as their
 functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at
 exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and
 inventories, property and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at
 historical rates.

Investments in debt and equity securities which are categorized neither as held-to-maturity nor trading and which are intended to be sold or mature more than one year from the balance sheet date or operating cycle, if longer. Such securities are reported at fair value; unrealized gains (losses) related to Available-for-sale Securities are excluded from earnings and reported in a separate component of shareholders' equity (other comprehensive income), unless the Available-for-sale security is designated as a hedge or is determined to have had an other than temporary decline in fair value below its amortized cost basis. All or a portion of the unrealized holding gain (loss) of an Available-for-sale security that is designated as being hedged in a fair value hedge is recognized in earnings during the period of the hedge, as are other than temporary declines in fair value below the cost basis for investments in equity securities and debt securities that an entity intends to sell or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell before the recovery of its amortized cost basis. Other than temporary declines in fair value below the cost basis for debt securities categorized as Available-for-sale that an entity does not intend to sell and for which it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell before the recovery of its amortized cost basis are bifurcated into credit losses and losses related to all other factors. Other than temporary declines in fair value below cost basis related to credit losses are recognized in earnings, and losses related to all other factors are recognized in other comprehensive income.

The Company may sell certain of its marketable
 securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic reasons
 including, but not limited to, anticipation of credit deterioration
 and duration management. The maturities of the Company’s
 long-term marketable securities generally range from one to five
 years.

As of September 26, 2015, the Company
 considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities
 investment portfolio to be temporary in nature and does not
 consider any of its investments other-than-temporarily impaired.
 The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its
 investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to
 any one issuer. The policy generally requires investments to be
 investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the
 potential risk of principal loss. Fair values were determined for
 each individual security in the investment portfolio. When
 evaluating an investment for other-than-temporary impairment the
 Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to
 which fair value has been below its cost basis, the financial
 condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, changes in market
 interest rates and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether
 it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the
 investment before recovery of the investment’s cost
 basis.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company may use derivatives to partially offset
 its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on
 expected future cash flows, on net investments in certain foreign
 subsidiaries and on certain existing assets and liabilities.
 However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for
 a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting
 considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging
 particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will
 offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from
 movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates.

To help protect gross margins from fluctuations in
 foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company’s
 subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar may hedge
 a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and subsidiaries
 whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar and who sell in
 local currencies may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory
 purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries’ functional
 currencies. The Company may enter into forward contracts, option
 contracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may
 designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company
 typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency
 exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically
 for up to 12 months.

To help protect the net investment in a foreign
 operation from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates,
 the Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option
 contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these
 investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
 In addition, the Company may use non-derivative financial
 instruments, such as its foreign currency-denominated debt, as
 economic hedges of its net investments in certain foreign
 subsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company designates these
 instruments as net investment hedges.



The Company may also enter into non-designated
 foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency
 exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of
 certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional
 currencies.

The Company may enter into interest rate swaps,
 options, or other instruments to manage interest rate risk. These
 instruments may offset a portion of changes in income or expense,
 or changes in fair value of the Company’s term debt or
 investments. The Company designates these instruments as either
 cash flow or fair value hedges. The Company’s hedged interest
 rate transactions as of September 26, 2015 are expected to be
 recognized within 10 years.

Cash Flow Hedges

The effective portions of cash flow hedges are
 recorded in AOCI until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.
 Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of
 foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales
 in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and
 deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory
 purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the
 same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred gains and
 losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or
 expense are recognized in other income/(expense), net in the same
 period as the related income or expense is recognized. The
 ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness
 testing of cash flow hedges are recognized in other
 income/(expense), net.

Derivative instruments designated as cash flow
 hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the
 forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially
 identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time
 period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such
 derivative instruments are reclassified immediately into other
 income/(expense), net. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such
 derivative instruments are reflected in other income/(expense), net
 unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions.

Net Investment Hedges

The effective portions of net investment hedges are
 recorded in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) as a
 part of the cumulative translation adjustment. The ineffective
 portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of net
 investment hedges are recognized in other income/(expense),
 net.

Fair Value Hedges

Gains and losses related to changes in fair value
 hedges are recognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss
 or gain related to the change in value of the underlying hedged
 item.

Non-Designated Derivatives

Derivatives that are not designated as hedging
 instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the
 financial statement line item to which the derivative relates.

The Company records all derivatives in the
 Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company’s
 accounting treatment for these derivative instruments is based on
 its hedge designation. The following tables show the
 Company’s derivative instruments at gross fair value as of
 September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014 (in
 millions):



Derivative assets

Derivative liabilities 
(2)

The
 fair value of derivative assets is measured using Level 2 fair
 value inputs and is recorded as other current assets in the
 Consolidated Balance Sheets.



The
 fair value of derivative liabilities is measured using Level 2 fair
 value inputs and is recorded as accrued expenses in the
 Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The following table shows the pre-tax gains and
 losses of the Company’s derivative and non-derivative
 instruments designated as cash flow, net investment and fair value
 hedges on OCI and the Consolidated Statements of Operations for
 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in millions):

The following table shows the notional amounts of
 the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments and credit
 risk amounts associated with outstanding or unsettled derivative
 instruments as of September 26, 2015 and September 27,
 2014 (in millions):



Instruments designated as accounting hedges:

Foreign exchange contracts

Interest rate contracts

Instruments not designated as accounting hedges:

Foreign exchange contracts



The notional amounts for outstanding derivative
 instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume
 outstanding and do not represent the amount of the Company’s
 exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts
 represent the Company’s gross exposure to potential
 accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or
 unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the
 terms of the contract, based on 
then-current
 currency or interest
 rates at each respective date. The Company’s exposure to
 credit loss and market risk will vary over time as currency and
 interest rates change. Although the table above reflects the
 notional and credit risk amounts of the Company’s derivative
 instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated
 with the exposures and transactions that the instruments are
 intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement
 of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses
 on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market
 conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.

The Company generally enters into master netting
 arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by
 permitting net settlement of transactions with the same
 counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally
 enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for
 collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of
 certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually
 established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets
 and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its
 Consolidated Balance Sheets. The net cash collateral received by
 the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral
 security arrangements was $1.0 billion as of September 26,
 2015 and $2.1 billion as of September 27, 2014.

Under master netting arrangements with the
 respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative
 contracts, the Company is allowed to net settle transactions
 with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of
 September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014, the potential
 effects of these rights of set-off associated with the
 Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of
 collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and
 derivative liabilities of $2.2 billion and $1.6 billion,
 respectively, resulting in net derivative liabilities
 of $78 million and $549 million, respectively.

Accounts Receivable

Trade Receivables

The Company has considerable trade receivables
 outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers,
 wholesalers, retailers, value-added resellers, small and mid-sized
 businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The
 Company generally does not require collateral from its customers;
 however, the Company will require collateral in certain instances
 to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company
 attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit
 insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party
 financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These
 credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party
 financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company
 generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing
 related to any of these arrangements.

As of September 26, 2015, the Company had one
 customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables,
 which accounted for 12%. As of September 27, 2014, the Company
 had two customers that represented 10% or more of total trade
 receivables, one of which accounted for 16% and the other 13%. The
 Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 71% and 72%
 of trade receivables as of September 26, 2015 and
 September 27, 2014, respectively.

Vendor Non-Trade Receivables

The Company has non-trade receivables from certain
 of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components
 to these vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final
 products for the Company. The Company purchases these components
 directly from suppliers. Vendor non-trade receivables from three of
 the Company’s vendors accounted for 38%, 18% and 14% of total
 vendor non-trade receivables as of September 26, 2015 and
 three of the Company’s vendors accounted for 51%, 16% and 14%
 of total vendor non-trade receivables as of September 27,
 2014.

The entire disclosure for financial instruments. This disclosure includes, but is not limited to, fair value measurements of short and long term marketable securities, international currencies forward contracts, and auction rate securities. Financial instruments may include hedging and non-hedging currency exchange instruments, derivatives, securitizations and securities available for sale at fair value.

['Summary of Significant Accounting Policies', 'Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting\n Policies\nApple Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries\n (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”)\n designs, manufactures and markets mobile communication and media\n devices, personal computers and portable digital music players, and\n sells a variety of related software, services, accessories,\n networking solutions and third-party digital content and\n applications. The Company sells its products worldwide through its\n retail stores, online stores and direct sales force, as well as\n through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers,\n retailers and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells\n a variety of third-party Apple-compatible products, including\n application software and various accessories through its online and\n retail stores. The Company sells to consumers, small and mid-sized\n businesses and education, enterprise and government customers.\n\nBasis of Presentation and Preparation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements\n include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and\n transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the\n Company’s management, the consolidated financial statements\n reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature,\n necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The\n preparation of these consolidated financial statements in\n conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\n (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and\n assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated\n financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could\n differ materially from those estimates.\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52 or\n 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The\n Company’s fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 ended on\n September\xa026, 2015,\xa0September\xa027, 2014 and\n September\xa028, 2013, respectively. An additional week is\n included in the first fiscal quarter approximately every six years\n to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Fiscal years\n 2015, 2014 and 2013 each spanned 52 weeks. Unless otherwise stated,\n references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer\n to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the\n associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\n\nRevenue Recognition\nNet sales consist primarily of revenue from the\n sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications,\n accessories, and service and support contracts. The Company\n recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement\n exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or\n determinable and collection is probable. Product is considered\n delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title, risk\n of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. For most of\n the Company’s product sales, these criteria are met at the\n time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for\n some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain\n other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives\n the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of\n loss on these sales during transit. For payment terms in excess of\n the Company’s standard payment terms, revenue is recognized\n as payments become due unless the Company has positive evidence\n that the sales price is fixed or determinable, such as a successful\n history of collection, without concession, on comparable\n arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of\n hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential\n to the functionality of the hardware and third-party digital\n content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue\n recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in\n accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for\n the following types of sales transactions: (i)\xa0standalone\n sales of software products, (ii)\xa0sales of software upgrades\n and (iii)\xa0sales of software bundled with hardware not\n essential to the functionality of the hardware.\nFor the sale of most third-party products, the\n Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to\n customers because the Company establishes its own pricing for such\n products, retains related inventory risk for physical products, is\n the primary obligor to the customer and assumes the credit risk for\n amounts billed to its customers. For third-party applications sold\n through the App Store and Mac App Store and certain digital content\n sold through the iTunes Store, the Company does not determine the\n selling price of the products and is not the primary obligor to the\n customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net\n basis by recognizing in net sales only the commission it retains\n from each sale. The portion of the gross amount billed to customers\n that is remitted by the Company to third-party app developers and\n certain digital content owners is not reflected in the\n Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\n \xa0\nThe Company records deferred revenue when it\n receives payments in advance of the delivery of products or the\n performance of services. This includes amounts that have been\n deferred for unspecified and specified software upgrade rights and\n non-software services that are attached to hardware and software\n products. The Company sells gift cards redeemable at its retail and\n online stores, and also sells gift cards redeemable on iTunes\n Store, App Store, Mac App Store and iBooks Store for the purchase\n of digital content and software. The Company records deferred\n revenue upon the sale of the card, which is relieved upon\n redemption of the card by the customer. Revenue from AppleCare\n service and support contracts is deferred and recognized over the\n service coverage periods. AppleCare service and support contracts\n typically include extended phone support, repair services,\n web-based support resources and diagnostic tools offered under the\n Company’s standard limited warranty.\nThe Company records reductions to revenue for\n estimated commitments related to price protection and other\n customer incentive programs. For transactions involving price\n protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated\n amount to be refunded. For the Company’s other customer\n incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is\n recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold\n the product or the date at which the program is offered. The\n Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future\n product returns based on the Company’s historical experience.\n Revenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers that are\n remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes\n recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant\n government authority.\n\nRevenue Recognition for Arrangements with Multiple\n Deliverables\nFor multi-element arrangements that include\n hardware products containing software essential to the hardware\n product’s functionality, undelivered software elements that\n relate to the hardware product’s essential software, and\n undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to\n all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such\n circumstances, the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the\n selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables:\n (i)\xa0vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value\n (“VSOE”), (ii)\xa0third-party evidence of selling\n price (“TPE”) and (iii)\xa0best estimate of selling\n price (“ESP”). VSOE generally exists only when the\n Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually\n charged by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs reflect the\n Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of\n elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone\n basis. For multi-element arrangements accounted for in accordance\n with industry specific software accounting guidance, the Company\n allocates revenue to all deliverables based on the VSOE of each\n element, and if VSOE does not exist revenue is recognized when\n elements lacking VSOE are delivered.\nFor sales of qualifying versions of iPhone, iPad\n and iPod touch (“iOS devices”), Mac, Apple Watch and\n Apple TV, the Company has indicated it may from time to time\n provide future unspecified software upgrades to the device’s\n essential software and/or non-software services free of charge. The\n Company has identified up to three deliverables regularly included\n in arrangements involving the sale of these devices. The first\n deliverable, which represents the substantial portion of the\n allocated sales price, is the hardware and software essential to\n the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of\n sale. The second deliverable is the embedded right included with\n qualifying devices to receive on a when-and-if-available basis,\n future unspecified software upgrades relating to the\n product’s essential software. The third deliverable is the\n non-software services to be provided to qualifying devices. The\n Company allocates revenue between these deliverables using the\n relative selling price method. Because the Company has neither VSOE\n nor TPE for these deliverables, the allocation of revenue is based\n on the Company’s ESPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered\n hardware and the related essential software is recognized at the\n time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition\n have been met. Revenue allocated to the embedded unspecified\n software upgrade rights and the non-software services is deferred\n and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period\n the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be\n provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and related\n essential software, including estimated warranty costs, are\n recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide\n non-software services are recognized as cost of sales as incurred,\n and engineering and sales and marketing costs are recognized as\n operating expenses as incurred.\nThe Company’s process for determining its ESP\n for deliverables without VSOE or TPE considers multiple factors\n that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances\n related to each deliverable including, where applicable, prices\n charged by the Company and market trends in the pricing for similar\n offerings, product specific business objectives, length of time a\n particular version of a device has been available, estimated cost\n to provide the non-software services and the relative ESP of the\n upgrade rights and non-software services as compared to the total\n selling price of the product.\nBeginning in September 2015, the Company reduced\n the combined ESPs for iOS devices and Mac between $5 and $10 to\n reflect the increase in competitive offers for similar products at\n little to no cost for users, which reduces the amount the Company\n could reasonably charge for these deliverables on a standalone\n basis.\n\nShipping Costs\nAmounts billed to customers related to shipping and\n handling are classified as revenue, and the Company’s\n shipping and handling costs are classified as cost of sales.\n\n \xa0\n\nWarranty Costs\nThe Company generally provides for the estimated\n cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related\n revenue is recognized. The Company assesses the adequacy of its\n accrued warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary\n based on actual experience and changes in future estimates.\n\nSoftware Development Costs\nResearch and development (“R&D”)\n costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer\n software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are subject to\n capitalization beginning when a product’s technological\n feasibility has been established and ending when a product is\n available for general release to customers. In most instances, the\n Company’s products are released soon after technological\n feasibility has been established and as a result software\n development costs were expensed as incurred.\n\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred and\n included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\n Advertising expense was $1.8 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion\n for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\n\nShare-based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes expense related to\n share-based payment transactions in which it receives employee\n services in exchange for (a)\xa0equity instruments of the Company\n or (b)\xa0liabilities that are based on the fair value of the\n Company’s equity instruments or that may be settled by the\n issuance of such equity instruments. Share-based compensation cost\n for restricted stock and restricted stock units\n (“RSUs”) is measured based on the closing fair market\n value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The\n Company recognizes share-based compensation cost over the\n award’s requisite service period on a straight-line basis for\n time-based RSUs and on a graded basis for RSUs that are contingent\n on the achievement of performance conditions. The Company\n recognizes a benefit from share-based compensation in the\n Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity if an excess\n tax benefit is realized. In addition, the Company recognizes the\n indirect effects of share-based compensation on R&D tax\n credits, foreign tax credits and domestic manufacturing deductions\n in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Further information\n regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9,\n “Benefit Plans.”\n\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes is computed using\n the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and\n liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences\n of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax\n bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax\n credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are\n measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to\n taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets\n and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The Company\n records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the\n amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.\nThe Company recognizes the tax benefit from an\n uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax\n position will be sustained on examination by the taxing\n authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax\n benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions\n are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater\n than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. See Note 5,\n “Income Taxes” for additional information.\n\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing\n income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average\n number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.\n Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income available\n to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of\n common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the\n number of additional shares of common stock that would have been\n outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued.\n Potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options,\n shares to be purchased under the Company’s employee stock\n purchase plan, unvested restricted stock and unvested RSUs. The\n dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in\n diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock\n method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair\n market value of the Company’s common stock can result in a\n greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities.\n\n \xa0\nThe following table shows the computation of basic\n and diluted earnings per share for 2015, 2014 and 2013 (net income\n in millions and shares in thousands):\n\n \xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n2015\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n2014\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n2013\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n Numerator:\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Net income\n\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n53,394\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n39,510\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n37,037\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n Denominator:\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Weighted-average shares outstanding\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n5,753,421\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n6,085,572\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n6,477,320\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n Effect of dilutive securities\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n39,648\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n37,091\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n44,314\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n Weighted-average diluted shares\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n5,793,069\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n6,122,663\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n6,521,634\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Basic earnings per share\n\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n9.28\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n6.49\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n5.72\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n Diluted earnings per share\n\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n9.22\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n6.45\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n5.68\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\nPotentially dilutive securities whose effect would\n have been antidilutive are excluded from the computation of diluted\n earnings per share.\n\nFinancial Instruments\n\nCash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nAll highly liquid investments with maturities of\n three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash\n equivalents. The Company’s marketable debt and equity\n securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. Management\n determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the\n time of purchase and reevaluates the classifications at each\n balance sheet date. The Company classifies its marketable debt\n securities as either short-term or long-term based on each\n instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date. Marketable\n debt securities with maturities of 12 months or less are classified\n as short-term and marketable debt securities with maturities\n greater than 12 months are classified as long-term. Marketable\n equity securities, including mutual funds, are classified as either\n short-term or long-term based on the nature of each security and\n its availability for use in current operations. The Company’s\n marketable debt and equity securities are carried at fair value,\n with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a\n component of accumulated other comprehensive income\n (“AOCI”) in shareholders’ equity, with the\n exception of unrealized losses believed to be other-than-temporary\n which are reported in earnings in the current period. The cost of\n securities sold is based upon the specific identification\n method.\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company accounts for its derivative instruments\n as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value.\nFor derivative instruments that hedge the exposure\n to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as\n cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the\n derivative instrument is reported as a component of AOCI in\n shareholders’ equity and reclassified into earnings in the\n same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects\n earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the\n derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in earnings in the\n current period. To receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow\n hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected\n future cash flows on hedged transactions. For options designated as\n cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the\n assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in\n earnings.\nFor derivative instruments that hedge the exposure\n to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that\n are designated as fair value hedges, both the net gain or loss on\n the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on\n the hedged item are recognized in earnings in the current\n period.\nFor derivative instruments and foreign currency\n debt that hedge the exposure to changes in foreign currency\n exchange rates used for translation of the net investment in a\n foreign operation and that are designated as a net investment\n hedge, the net gain or loss on the effective portion of the\n derivative instrument is reported in the same manner as a foreign\n currency translation adjustment. For forward exchange contracts\n designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes\n in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component\n from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or\n losses related to this forward carry component are recognized in\n earnings in the current period.\nDerivatives that do not qualify as hedges are\n adjusted to fair value through earnings in the current period.\n\n \xa0\n\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe Company records its allowance for doubtful\n accounts based upon its assessment of various factors, including\n historical experience, age of the accounts receivable balances,\n credit quality of the Company’s customers, current economic\n conditions and other factors that may affect the customers’\n ability to pay.\n\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost,\n computed using the first-in, first-out method and net realizable\n value. Any adjustments to reduce the cost of inventories to their\n net realizable value are recognized in earnings in the current\n period. As of September\xa026, 2015 and September\xa027, 2014,\n the Company’s inventories consist primarily of finished\n goods.\n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost.\n Depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line method over the\n estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the\n lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying\n building; between one to five years for machinery and equipment,\n including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; and\n the shorter of lease terms or ten years for leasehold improvements.\n The Company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop\n internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the\n preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related to\n internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method\n over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from\n three to five years. Depreciation and amortization expense on\n property and equipment was $9.2 billion, $6.9 billion and $5.8\n billion during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\n\nLong-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired\n Intangible Assets\nThe Company reviews property, plant and equipment,\n inventory component prepayments and certain identifiable\n intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment. Long-lived assets\n are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in\n circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be\n recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by\n comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash\n flows the assets are expected to generate. If property, plant and\n equipment, inventory component prepayments and certain identifiable\n intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be\n recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the\n assets exceeds its fair value.\nThe Company does not amortize goodwill and\n intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, rather such assets\n are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or\n sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that\n the assets may be impaired. The Company performs its goodwill and\n intangible asset impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each\n year. The Company did not recognize any impairment charges related\n to goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets during 2015, 2014\n and 2013. The Company established reporting units based on its\n current reporting structure. For purposes of testing goodwill for\n impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to\n the extent it relates to each reporting unit. In 2015 and 2014, the\n Company’s goodwill was primarily allocated to the Americas\n and Europe reporting units.\nThe Company amortizes its intangible assets with\n definite useful lives over their estimated useful lives and reviews\n these assets for impairment. The Company typically amortizes its\n acquired intangible assets with definite useful lives over periods\n from three to seven years.\n\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company applies fair value accounting for all\n financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and\n liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the\n financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair\n value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or\n paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between\n market participants at the measurement date. When determining the\n fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are\n required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the\n principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would\n transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that\n market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability,\n such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer\n restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying\n the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to\n measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization\n within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is\n available and significant to the fair value measurement:\n\nLevel 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for\n identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 – Observable inputs other than\n quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and\n liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or\n liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are\n observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for\n substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 – Inputs that are generally\n unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimate of\n assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset\n or liability.\n\n \xa0\nThe Company’s valuation techniques used to\n measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable\n equity securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets\n for identical assets or liabilities. The valuation techniques used\n to measure the fair value of the Company’s debt instruments\n and all other financial instruments, all of which have\n counterparties with high credit ratings, were valued based on\n quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant\n inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.\nIn accordance with the fair value accounting\n requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible financial\n instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company has\n not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial\n instruments.\n\nForeign Currency Translation and Remeasurement\nThe Company translates the assets and liabilities\n of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S.\n dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period.\n Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using\n rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and\n losses from these translations are recognized in foreign currency\n translation included in AOCI in shareholders’ equity. The\n Company’s subsidiaries that use the U.S. dollar as their\n functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at\n exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and\n inventories, property and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at\n historical rates.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '2015', '', '', '2014', '', '', '2013', '', 'Numerator:', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Net income', '', '$', '53,394', '', '', '$', '39,510', '', '', '$', '37,037', '', 'Denominator:', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Weighted-average shares outstanding', '', '', '5,753,421', '', '', '', '6,085,572', '', '', '', '6,477,320', '', 'Effect of dilutive securities', '', '', '39,648', '', '', '', '37,091', '', '', '', '44,314', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Weighted-average diluted shares', '', '', '5,793,069', '', '', '', '6,122,663', '', '', '', '6,521,634', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Basic earnings per share', '', '$', '9.28', '', '', '$', '6.49', '', '', '$', '5.72', '', 'Diluted earnings per share', '', '$', '9.22', '', '', '$', '6.45', '', '', '$', '5.68', '']

All or a portion of the unrealized holding gain (loss) of an Available-for-sale security that is designated as being hedged in a fair value hedge is recognized in earnings during the period of the hedge, as are other than temporary declines in fair value below the cost basis for investments in equity securities and debt securities that an entity intends to sell or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell before the recovery of its amortized cost basis. Other than temporary declines in fair value below the cost basis for debt securities categorized as Available-for-sale that an entity does not intend to sell and for which it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell before the recovery of its amortized cost basis are bifurcated into credit losses and losses related to all other factors.

['Benefit Plans', 'Note 9 – Benefit Plans\n\n2014 Employee Stock Plan\nIn the second quarter of 2014, shareholders\n approved the 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”)\n and terminated the Company’s authority to grant new awards\n under the 2003 Employee Stock Plan (the “2003 Plan”).\n The 2014 Plan provides for broad-based equity grants to employees,\n including executive officers, and permits the granting of RSUs,\n stock grants, performance-based awards, stock options and stock\n appreciation rights, as well as cash bonus awards. RSUs granted\n under the 2014 Plan generally vest over four years, based on\n continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the\n Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis. Each share\n issued with respect to RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan reduces the\n number of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares.\n RSUs cancelled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding\n obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under\n the 2014 Plan utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs\n cancelled or shares withheld. Currently, all RSUs granted under the\n 2014 Plan have dividend equivalent rights (“DERs”),\n which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share\n as holders of common stock. DERs are subject to the same vesting\n and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs.\n DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. Upon\n approval of the 2014 Plan, the Company reserved 385\xa0million\n shares plus the number of shares remaining that were reserved but\n not issued under the 2003 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding\n awards under the 2003 Plan that expire, are cancelled or otherwise\n terminate, or are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations\n with respect to RSUs, will also be available for awards under the\n 2014 Plan. As of September\xa026, 2015, approximately\n 442.9\xa0million shares were reserved for future issuance under\n the 2014 Plan.\n\n2003 Employee Stock Plan\nThe 2003 Plan is a shareholder approved plan that\n provided for broad-based equity grants to employees, including\n executive officers. The 2003 Plan permitted the granting of\n incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, RSUs, stock\n appreciation rights, stock purchase rights and performance-based\n awards. Options granted under the 2003 Plan generally expire seven\n to ten years after the grant date and generally become exercisable\n over a period of four years, based on continued employment, with\n either annual, semi-annual or quarterly vesting. RSUs granted under\n the 2003 Plan generally vest over two to four years, based on\n continued employment and are settled upon vesting in shares of the\n Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis. All RSUs,\n other than RSUs held by the Chief Executive Officer, granted under\n the 2003 Plan have DERs. DERs are subject to the same vesting and\n other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs\n are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. In the\n second quarter of 2014, the Company terminated the authority to\n grant new awards under the 2003 Plan.\n\n1997 Director Stock Plan\nThe 1997 Director Stock Plan (the “Director\n Plan”) is a shareholder approved plan that (i)\xa0permits\n the Company to grant awards of RSUs or stock options to the\n Company’s non-employee directors, (ii)\xa0provides for\n automatic initial grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director\n joining the Board of Directors and automatic annual grants of RSUs\n at each annual meeting of shareholders, and (iii)\xa0permits the\n Board of Directors to prospectively change the relative mixture of\n stock options and RSUs for the initial and annual award grants and\n the methodology for determining the number of shares of the\n Company’s common stock subject to these grants without\n shareholder approval. Each share issued with respect to RSUs\n granted under the Director Plan reduces the number of shares\n available for grant under the plan by two shares. The Director Plan\n expires November\xa09, 2019. All RSUs granted under the Director\n Plan are entitled to DERs. DERs are subject to the same vesting and\n other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs\n are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. As of\n September\xa026, 2015, approximately 1.2\xa0million shares were\n reserved for future issuance under the Director Plan.\n\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Plans\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, Section\xa016\n officers Timothy D. Cook, Angela Ahrendts, Luca Maestri, Daniel\n Riccio, Philip Schiller and Jeffrey Williams had equity trading\n plans in place in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the\n Exchange Act. An equity trading plan is a written document that\n pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for\n determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or\n sales of the Company’s stock, including shares acquired\n pursuant to the Company’s employee and director equity\n plans.\n\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the\n “Purchase Plan”) is a shareholder approved plan under\n which substantially all employees may purchase the Company’s\n common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of\n the lower of the fair market values of the stock as of the\n beginning or the end of six-month offering periods. An\n employee’s payroll deductions under the Purchase Plan are\n limited to 10% of the employee’s compensation and employees\n may not purchase more than $25,000 of stock during any calendar\n year. As of September\xa026, 2015, approximately\n 53.0\xa0million shares were reserved for future issuance under\n the Purchase Plan.\n\n \xa0\n\n401(k) Plan\nThe Company’s 401(k) Plan is a deferred\n salary arrangement under Section\xa0401(k) of the Internal\n Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, participating U.S. employees\n may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the IRS annual\n contribution limit ($18,000 for calendar year 2015). The Company\n matches 50% to 100% of each employee’s contributions,\n depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the\n employee’s eligible earnings. The Company’s matching\n contributions to the 401(k) Plan were $200 million, $163 million\n and $135 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\n\nRestricted Stock Units\nA summary of the Company’s RSU activity and\n related information for 2015, 2014 and 2013, is as follows:\n\n \xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\nNumber of\nRSUs\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0(in\xa0thousands)\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\nWeighted-Average\nGrant Date Fair\n Value Per Share\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\nAggregate\n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Intrinsic\xa0Value\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\n(in\xa0millions)\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n Balance at September\xa029, 2012\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n105,037\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n49.27\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n RSUs granted\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n39,415\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n78.23\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n RSUs vested\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n(42,291\n)\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n45.96\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n RSUs cancelled\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n(8,877\n)\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n57.31\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Balance at September\xa028, 2013\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n93,284\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n62.24\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n RSUs granted\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n59,269\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n74.54\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n RSUs vested\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n(43,111\n)\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n57.29\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n RSUs cancelled\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n(5,620\n)\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n68.47\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Balance at September\xa027, 2014\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n103,822\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n70.98\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n RSUs granted\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n45,587\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n105.51\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n RSUs vested\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n(41,684\n)\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n71.32\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n RSUs cancelled\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n(6,258\n)\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n80.34\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Balance at September\xa026, 2015\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n101,467\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n85.77\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n11,639\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fair value as of the respective vesting dates\n of RSUs was $4.8 billion, $3.4 billion and $3.1 billion for 2015,\n 2014 and 2013, respectively. The majority of RSUs that vested in\n 2015, 2014 and 2013 were net-share settled such that the Company\n withheld shares with value equivalent to the employees’\n minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other\n employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing\n authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately\n 14.1\xa0million, 15.6\xa0million and 15.5\xa0million for\n 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and were based on the value of\n the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the\n Company’s closing stock price. Total payments for the\n employees’ tax obligations to taxing authorities were $1.6\n billion, $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion in 2015, 2014 and 2013,\n respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within the\n Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\xa0These net-share\n settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the Company as\n they reduced the number of shares that would have otherwise been\n issued as a result of the vesting and did not represent an expense\n to the Company.\n\nStock Options\nThe Company had 1.2\xa0million stock options\n outstanding as of September\xa026, 2015, with a weighted-average\n exercise price per share of $15.08 and weighted-average remaining\n contractual term of 4.1 years, substantially all of which are\n exercisable. The aggregate intrinsic value of the stock options\n outstanding as of September\xa026, 2015 was $120 million, which\n represents the value of the Company’s closing stock price on\n the last trading day of the period in excess of the\n weighted-average exercise price multiplied by the number of options\n outstanding. Total intrinsic value of options at time of exercise\n was $479 million, $1.5 billion and $1.0 billion for 2015, 2014 and\n 2013, respectively.\n\n \xa0\n\nShare-based Compensation\nThe following table shows a summary of the\n share-based compensation expense included in the Consolidated\n Statements of Operations for 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in millions):\n\n \xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n2015\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n2014\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n2013\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n Cost of sales\n\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n575\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n450\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n350\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n Research and development\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa01,536\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa01,216\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0917\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n Selling, general and administrative\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n1,475\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n1,197\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n986\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n Total share-based compensation expense\n\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n\xa0\xa03,586\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n\xa0\xa02,863\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n\xa0\xa02,253\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\nThe income tax benefit related to share-based\n compensation expense was $1.2 billion, $1.0 billion and $816\n million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Other agreements entered into by the Company\n sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the\n Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an\n infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified\n third-party. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a\n reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material\n loss with respect to indemnification of end-users of its operating\n system or application software for infringement of third-party\n intellectual property rights. The Company did not record a\n liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of\n September\xa026, 2015 or September\xa027, 2014.\nIn September 2015, the Company introduced the\n iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who\n purchase an iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in one of its U.S. physical\n retail stores and activate the purchased iPhone with one of the\n four national carriers. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides\n customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a new iPhone,\n provided certain conditions are met. One of the conditions of this\n program requires the customer to finance the initial purchase price\n of the iPhone with a third-party lender. Upon exercise of the\n trade-in right and purchase of a new iPhone, the Company satisfies\n the customer’s outstanding balance due to the third-party\n lender on the original device. The Company accounts for the\n trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement\n revenue net of the fair value of such right with subsequent changes\n to the guarantee liability recognized within revenue.\nThe Company has entered into indemnification\n agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these\n agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to\n the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise\n by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance\n expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related\n legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum\n potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make\n under these agreements due to the limited history of prior\n indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances\n involved in each claim. However, the Company maintains directors\n and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to\n such obligations.\n\nConcentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials\n and Product\nAlthough most components essential to the\n Company’s business are generally available from multiple\n sources, a number of components are currently obtained from single\n or limited sources. In addition, the Company competes for various\n components with other participants in the markets for mobile\n communication and media devices and personal computers. Therefore,\n many components used by the Company, including those that are\n available from multiple sources, are at times subject to\n industry-wide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that\n could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial\n condition and operating results.\n\n \xa0\nThe Company uses some custom components that are\n not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced\n by the Company often utilize custom components available from only\n one source. When a component or product uses new technologies,\n initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’\n yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the\n Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product\n were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed\n shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s\n financial condition and operating results could be materially\n adversely affected. The Company’s business and financial\n performance could also be materially adversely affected depending\n on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the\n original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities\n from an alternative source. Continued availability of these\n components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if\n those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components\n instead of components customized to meet the Company’s\n requirements.\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the\n supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that\n the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on\n similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to\n significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that\n could materially adversely affect its financial condition and\n operating results.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s hardware\n products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located\n primarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this\n manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of\n outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these\n outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced suppliers of components\n and manufacturers for many of the Company’s products.\n Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on\n manufacturing schedules, the Company’s operating results\n could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable\n to meet their production commitments. The Company’s purchase\n commitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150\n days.\n\nOther Off-Balance Sheet Commitments\n\nOperating Leases\nThe Company leases various equipment and\n facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating\n lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any\n other off-balance sheet financing arrangements. The major facility\n leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally\n contain multi-year renewal options. As of September\xa026, 2015,\n the Company had a total of 463 retail stores. Leases for retail\n space are for terms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of\n which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal\n options. As of September\xa026, 2015, the Company’s total\n future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases\n were $6.3 billion, of which $3.6 billion related to leases for\n retail space.\nRent expense under all operating leases, including\n both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $794 million, $717\n million and $645 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\n Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases\n having remaining terms in excess of one year as of\n September\xa026, 2015, are as follows (in millions):\n\n \xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 2016\n\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n772\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n 2017\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n774\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n 2018\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n744\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n 2019\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n715\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n 2020\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n674\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n Thereafter\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n2,592\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n Total\n\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n\xa0\xa06,271\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\nOther Commitments\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners\n to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company’s products and\n to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. These\n outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on\n demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers\n periods up to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual\n components for its products from a wide variety of individual\n suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires\n components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier\n contracts and open orders based on projected demand information.\n Where appropriate,\xa0the\xa0purchases are applied\n to\xa0inventory component prepayments\xa0that\n are\xa0outstanding with the\xa0respective supplier. As of\n September\xa026, 2015, the Company had outstanding off-balance\n sheet third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase\n commitments of $29.5 billion.\n\n \xa0\nIn addition to the commitments mentioned above, the\n Company had other off-balance sheet obligations of $7.3 billion as\n of September\xa026, 2015 that consisted of commitments to acquire\n capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process\n equipment, and commitments related to inventory prepayments,\n advertising, licensing, R&D, internet and telecommunications\n services, energy and other obligations.\n\nContingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings\n and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and\n that have not been fully adjudicated, certain of which are\n discussed in Part I, Item\xa01A of this Form 10-K under the\n heading “Risk Factors” and in Part I, Item\xa03 of\n this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings.”\n In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable\n possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a\n material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss\n contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. However, the\n outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, although\n management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be\n remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against\n the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of\n management’s expectations, the Company’s consolidated\n financial statements for that reporting period could be materially\n adversely affected.\n\nApple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd, et al.\nOn August\xa024, 2012, a jury returned a verdict\n awarding the Company $1.05 billion in its lawsuit against Samsung\n Electronics Co., Ltd and affiliated parties in the United States\n District Court, Northern District of California, San Jose Division.\n On March\xa06, 2014, the District Court entered final judgment in\n favor of the Company in the amount of approximately $930\n million.\xa0On May\xa018, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for\n the Federal Circuit affirmed in part, and reversed in part, the\n decision of the District Court. As a result, the Court of Appeals\n ordered entry of final judgment on damages in the amount of\n approximately $548 million, with the District Court to determine\n supplemental damages and interest, as well as damages owed for\n products subject to the reversal in part. Because\xa0the ruling\n remains subject to further proceedings, the Company has not\n recognized the award in its results of operations.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '2015', '', '', '2014', '', '', '2013', '', 'Beginning accrued warranty and related costs', '', '$', '4,159', '', '', '$', '2,967', '', '', '$', '1,638', '', 'Cost of warranty claims', '', '', '(4,401', ')', '', '', '(3,760', ')', '', '', '(3,703', ')', 'Accruals for product warranty', '', '', '5,022', '', '', '', '4,952', '', '', '', '5,032', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Ending accrued warranty and related costs', '', '$', '4,780', '', '', '$', '4,159', '', '', '$', '2,967', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '2016', '', '$', '772', '', '2017', '', '', '774', '', '2018', '', '', '744', '', '2019', '', '', '715', '', '2020', '', '', '674', '', 'Thereafter', '', '', '2,592', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Total', '', '$', '6,271', '', '', '', '', '', '']

['Segment Information and Geographic Data', 'Note 11 – Segment Information and Geographic Data\nThe Company reports segment information based on\n the “management” approach. The management approach\n designates the internal reporting used by management for making\n decisions and assessing performance as the source of the\n Company’s reportable operating segments.\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a\n geographic basis. The Company’s reportable operating segments\n consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of\n Asia Pacific. The Americas segment includes both North and South\n America. The Europe segment includes European countries, as well as\n India, the Middle East and Africa. The Greater China segment\n includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The Rest of Asia Pacific\n segment includes Australia and those Asian countries not included\n in the Company’s other reportable operating segments.\n Although each reportable operating segment provides similar\n hardware and software products and similar services, they are\n managed separately to better align with the location of the\n Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique\n market dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting policies\n of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1,\n “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its\n reportable operating segments based on net sales and operating\n income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on\n the location of customers and sales through the Company’s\n retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating\n income for each segment includes net sales to third parties,\n related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable\n to the segment.

The\n Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to\n acquire any specific number of shares. Under the program, shares\n may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market\n transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1\n under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the\n “Exchange Act”).\nThe Company has entered, and in the future may\n enter, into accelerated share repurchase arrangements\n (“ASRs”) with financial institutions. In exchange for\n up-front payments, the financial institutions deliver shares of the\n Company’s common stock during the purchase periods of each\n ASR. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore\n the average repurchase price paid per share, is determined at the\n end of the applicable purchase period of each ASR based on the\n volume weighted-average price of the Company’s common stock\n during that period. The shares received are retired in the periods\n they are delivered, and the up-front payments are accounted for as\n a reduction to shareholders’ equity in the Company’s\n Consolidated Balance Sheets in the periods the payments are made.\n The Company reflects the ASRs as a repurchase of common stock in\n the period delivered for purposes of calculating earnings per share\n and as forward contracts indexed to its own common stock. The ASRs\n met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification, and\n therefore were not accounted for as derivative instruments.\nThe following table shows the Company’s ASR\n activity and

If a tax\n position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold it is\n then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in\n the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the\n largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being\n realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company classifies gross\n interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not\n expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as\n non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAs of September\xa026, 2015, the total amount of\n gross unrecognized tax benefits was $6.9 billion, of which $2.5\n billion, if recognized, would affect the Company’s effective\n tax rate. As of September\xa027, 2014, the total amount of gross\n unrecognized tax benefits was $4.0 billion, of which $1.4 billion,\n if recognized, would affect the Company’s effective tax\n rate.\nThe aggregate changes in the balance of gross\n unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties,\n for 2015, 2014 and 2013, is as follows (in millions):\n\n \xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n2015\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n2014\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n2013\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n Beginning Balance\n\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa04,033\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa02,714\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa02,062\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n Increases related to tax positions taken during a prior year\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n2,056\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n1,295\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n745\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n Decreases related to tax positions taken during a prior year\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n(345\n)\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n(280\n)\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n(118\n)\xa0\n\n\n\n\n Increases related to tax positions taken during the current\n year\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n1,278\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n882\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n626\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n Decreases related to settlements with taxing authorities\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n(109\n)\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n(574\n)\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n(592\n)\xa0\n\n\n\n\n Decreases related to expiration of statute of limitations\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n(13\n)\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n(4\n)\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n(9\n)\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n Ending Balance\n\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n6,900\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n4,033\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n2,714\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\nThe Company includes interest and penalties related\n to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes.\n As of September\xa026, 2015 and September\xa027, 2014, the\n total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $1.3\n billion and $630 million, respectively, which is classified as\n non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In\n connection with tax matters, the Company recognized interest and\n penalty expense in 2015, 2014 and 2013 of $709 million, $40 million\n and $189 million, respectively.\n\n \xa0\nThe Company is subject to taxation and files income\n tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and\n foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the\n “IRS”) is currently examining the years 2010 through\n 2012, and all years prior to 2010 are closed. In addition, the\n Company is subject to audits by state, local and foreign tax\n authorities.\xa0In major states and major foreign jurisdictions,\n the years subsequent to 2003 generally remain open and could be\n subject to examination by the taxing authorities.\nManagement believes that an adequate provision has\n been made for any adjustments that may result from tax\n examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be\n predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the\n Company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent\n with management’s expectations, the Company could be required\n to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such\n resolution occurs. Although timing of the resolution and/or closure\n of audits is not certain, the Company does not believe it is\n reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits would\n materially change in the next 12\xa0months.\nOn June\xa011, 2014, the European Commission\n issued an opening decision initiating a formal investigation\n against Ireland for alleged state aid to the Company. The opening\n decision concerns the allocation of profits for taxation purposes\n of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company. The\n Company believes the European Commission’s assertions are\n without merit. If the European Commission were to conclude against\n Ireland, the European Commission could require Ireland to recover\n from the Company past taxes covering a period of up to 10 years\n reflective of the disallowed state aid. While such amount could be\n material, as of September\xa026, 2015 the Company is unable to\n estimate the impact.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '2015', '', '', '2014', '', '', '2013', '', 'Federal:', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Current', '', '$', '11,730', '', '', '$', '8,624', '', '', '$', '9,334', '', 'Deferred', '', '', '3,408', '', '', '', '3,183', '', '', '', '1,878', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '15,138', '', '', '', '11,807', '', '', '', '11,212', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'State:', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Current', '', '', '1,265', '', '', '', '855', '', '', '', '1,084', '', 'Deferred', '', '', '(220', ')', '', '', '(178', ')', '', '', '(311', ')', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '1,045', '', '', '', '677', '', '', '', '773', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Foreign:', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Current', '', '', '4,744', '', '', '', '2,147', '', '', '', '1,559', '', 'Deferred', '', '', '(1,806', ')', '', '', '(658', ')', '', '', '(426', ')', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '2,938', '', '', '', '1,489', '', '', '', '1,133', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Provision for income taxes', '', '$', '19,121', '', '', '$', '13,973', '', '', '$', '13,118', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '2015', '', '', '2014', '', '', '2013', '', 'Computed expected tax', '', '$', '25,380', '', '', '$', '18,719', '', '', '$', '17,554', '', 'State taxes, net of federal effect', '', '', '680', '', '', '', '469', '', '', '', '508', '', 'Indefinitely invested earnings of foreign subsidiaries', '', '', '(6,470', ')', '', '', '(4,744', ')', '', '', '(4,614', ')', 'Domestic production activities deduction', '', '', '(426', ')', '', '', '(495', ')', '', '', '(308', ')', 'Research and development credit, net', '', '', '(171', ')', '', '', '(88', ')', '', '', '(287', ')', 'Other', '', '', '128', '', '', '', '112', '', '', '', '265', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Provision for income taxes', '', '$', '19,121', '', '', '$', '13,973', '', '', '$', '13,118', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Effective tax rate', '', '', '26.4%', '', '', '', '26.1%', '', '', '', '26.2%', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '2015', '', '', '2014', '', 'Deferred tax assets:', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Accrued liabilities and other reserves', '', '$', '4,205', '', '', '$', '3,326', '', 'Basis of capital assets and investments', '', '', '2,238', '', '', '', '898', '', 'Deferred revenue', '', '', '1,941', '', '', '', '1,787', '', 'Deferred cost sharing', '', '', '667', '', '', '', '0', '', 'Share-based compensation', '', '', '575', '', '', '', '454', '', 'Unrealized losses', '', '', '564', '', '', '', '130', '', 'Other', '', '', '721', '', '', '', '227', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Total deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance of $0', '', '', '10,911', '', '', '', '6,822', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Deferred tax liabilities:', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries', '', '', '26,868', '', '', '', '21,544', '', 'Other', '', '', '303', '', '', '', '398', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Total deferred tax liabilities', '', '', '27,171', '', '', '', '21,942', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Net deferred tax liabilities', '', '$', '(16,260', ')', '', '$', '(15,120', ')', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '2015', '', '', '2014', '', '', '2013', '', 'Beginning Balance', '', '$', '4,033', '', '', '$', '2,714', '', '', '$', '2,062', '', 'Increases related to tax positions taken during a prior year', '', '', '2,056', '', '', '', '1,295', '', '', '', '745', '', 'Decreases related to tax positions taken during a prior year', '', '', '(345', ')', '', '', '(280', ')', '', '', '(118', ')', 'Increases related to tax positions taken during the current\n year', '', '', '1,278', '', '', '', '882', '', '', '', '626', '', 'Decreases related to settlements with taxing authorities', '', '', '(109', ')', '', '', '(574', ')', '', '', '(592', ')', 'Decreases related to expiration of statute of limitations', '', '', '(13', ')', '', '', '(4', ')', '', '', '(9', ')', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Ending Balance', '', '$', '6,900', '', '', '$', '4,033', '', '', '$', '2,714', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']

manage foreign currency risk associated with the\n euro-denominated notes issued in the first quarter of 2015 and the\n British pound-denominated, Australian dollar-denominated and\n euro-denominated notes issued in the fourth quarter of 2015, the\n Company entered into currency swaps with an aggregate notional\n amount of $3.5 billion, $1.9 billion, $1.6 billion and $2.2\n billion, respectively, which effectively converted these notes to\n U.S. dollar-denominated notes.\n\n \xa0\nTo manage interest rate risk on the U.S.\n dollar-denominated fixed-rate notes issued in the second quarter of\n 2015 and maturing in 2020 and 2022, the Company entered into\n interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $2.5\n billion. To manage interest rate risk on the U.S.\n dollar-denominated fixed-rate notes issued in the third quarter of\n 2015 and maturing in 2017, 2020, 2022 and 2025, the Company entered\n into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $4.3\n billion. These interest rate swaps effectively converted the fixed\n interest rates on the U.S. dollar-denominated notes to a floating\n interest rate.\nAs of September\xa026, 2015, ¥250.0 billion\n of the Japanese yen-denominated notes was designated as a hedge of\n the foreign currency exposure of its net investment in a foreign\n operation. The foreign currency transaction gain or loss on the\n Japanese yen-denominated debt designated as a hedge is recorded in\n OCI as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. As of\n September\xa026, 2015, the carrying value of the debt designated\n as a net investment hedge was $2.1 billion.\nFor further discussion regarding the\n Company’s use of derivative instruments see the Derivative\n Financial Instruments section of Note\xa02, “Financial\n Instruments.”\nThe effective interest rates for the Notes include\n the interest on the Notes, amortization of the discount and, if\n applicable, adjustments related to hedging.

Intercompany accounts and\n transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the\n Company’s management, the consolidated financial statements\n reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature,\n necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The\n preparation of these consolidated financial statements in\n conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\n (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and\n assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated\n financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could\n differ materially from those estimates.\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52 or\n 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September.

['Revenue Recognition', 'Revenue Recognition\nNet sales consist primarily of revenue from the\n sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications,\n accessories, and service and support contracts. The Company\n recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement\n exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or\n determinable and collection is probable. Product is considered\n delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title, risk\n of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. For most of\n the Company’s product sales, these criteria are met at the\n time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for\n some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain\n other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives\n the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of\n loss on these sales during transit. For payment terms in excess of\n the Company’s standard payment terms, revenue is recognized\n as payments become due unless the Company has positive evidence\n that the sales price is fixed or determinable, such as a successful\n history of collection, without concession, on comparable\n arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of\n hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential\n to the functionality of the hardware and third-party digital\n content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue\n recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in\n accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for\n the following types of sales transactions: (i)\xa0standalone\n sales of software products, (ii)\xa0sales of software upgrades\n and (iii)\xa0sales of software bundled with hardware not\n essential to the functionality of the hardware.\nFor the sale of most third-party products, the\n Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to\n customers because the Company establishes its own pricing for such\n products, retains related inventory risk for physical products, is\n the primary obligor to the customer and assumes the credit risk for\n amounts billed to its customers. For third-party applications sold\n through the App Store and Mac App Store and certain digital content\n sold through the iTunes Store, the Company does not determine the\n selling price of the products and is not the primary obligor to the\n customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net\n basis by recognizing in net sales only the commission it retains\n from each sale. The portion of the gross amount billed to customers\n that is remitted by the Company to third-party app developers and\n certain digital content owners is not reflected in the\n Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\n \xa0\nThe Company records deferred revenue when it\n receives payments in advance of the delivery of products or the\n performance of services. This includes amounts that have been\n deferred for unspecified and specified software upgrade rights and\n non-software services that are attached to hardware and software\n products. The Company sells gift cards redeemable at its retail and\n online stores, and also sells gift cards redeemable on iTunes\n Store, App Store, Mac App Store and iBooks Store for the purchase\n of digital content and software. The Company records deferred\n revenue upon the sale of the card, which is relieved upon\n redemption of the card by the customer. Revenue from AppleCare\n service and support contracts is deferred and recognized over the\n service coverage periods. AppleCare service and support contracts\n typically include extended phone support, repair services,\n web-based support resources and diagnostic tools offered under the\n Company’s standard limited warranty.\nThe Company records reductions to revenue for\n estimated commitments related to price protection and other\n customer incentive programs. For transactions involving price\n protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated\n amount to be refunded. For the Company’s other customer\n incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is\n recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold\n the product or the date at which the program is offered. The\n Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future\n product returns based on the Company’s historical experience.\n Revenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers that are\n remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes\n recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant\n government authority.\n\nRevenue Recognition for Arrangements with Multiple\n Deliverables\nFor multi-element arrangements that include\n hardware products containing software essential to the hardware\n product’s functionality, undelivered software elements that\n relate to the hardware product’s essential software, and\n undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to\n all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such\n circumstances, the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the\n selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables:\n (i)\xa0vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value\n (“VSOE”), (ii)\xa0third-party evidence of selling\n price (“TPE”) and (iii)\xa0best estimate of selling\n price (“ESP”). VSOE generally exists only when the\n Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually\n charged by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs reflect the\n Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of\n elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone\n basis. For multi-element arrangements accounted for in accordance\n with industry specific software accounting guidance, the Company\n allocates revenue to all deliverables based on the VSOE of each\n element, and if VSOE does not exist revenue is recognized when\n elements lacking VSOE are delivered.\nFor sales of qualifying versions of iPhone, iPad\n and iPod touch (“iOS devices”), Mac, Apple Watch and\n Apple TV, the Company has indicated it may from time to time\n provide future unspecified software upgrades to the device’s\n essential software and/or non-software services free of charge. The\n Company has identified up to three deliverables regularly included\n in arrangements involving the sale of these devices. The first\n deliverable, which represents the substantial portion of the\n allocated sales price, is the hardware and software essential to\n the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of\n sale. The second deliverable is the embedded right included with\n qualifying devices to receive on a when-and-if-available basis,\n future unspecified software upgrades relating to the\n product’s essential software. The third deliverable is the\n non-software services to be provided to qualifying devices. The\n Company allocates revenue between these deliverables using the\n relative selling price method. Because the Company has neither VSOE\n nor TPE for these deliverables, the allocation of revenue is based\n on the Company’s ESPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered\n hardware and the related essential software is recognized at the\n time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition\n have been met. Revenue allocated to the embedded unspecified\n software upgrade rights and the non-software services is deferred\n and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period\n the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be\n provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and related\n essential software, including estimated warranty costs, are\n recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide\n non-software services are recognized as cost of sales as incurred,\n and engineering and sales and marketing costs are recognized as\n operating expenses as incurred.\nThe Company’s process for determining its ESP\n for deliverables without VSOE or TPE considers multiple factors\n that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances\n related to each deliverable including, where applicable, prices\n charged by the Company and market trends in the pricing for similar\n offerings, product specific business objectives, length of time a\n particular version of a device has been available, estimated cost\n to provide the non-software services and the relative ESP of the\n upgrade rights and non-software services as compared to the total\n selling price of the product.\nBeginning in September 2015, the Company reduced\n the combined ESPs for iOS devices and Mac between $5 and $10 to\n reflect the increase in competitive offers for similar products at\n little to no cost for users, which reduces the amount the Company\n could reasonably charge for these deliverables on a standalone\n basis.']
['Shipping Costs', 'Shipping Costs\nAmounts billed to customers related to shipping and\n handling are classified as revenue, and the Company’s\n shipping and handling costs are classified as cost of sales.']
['Warranty Costs', 'Warranty Costs\nThe Company generally provides for the estimated\n cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related\n revenue is recognized. The Company assesses the adequacy of its\n accrued warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary\n based on actual experience and changes in future estimates.']
['Software Development Costs', 'Software Development Costs\nResearch and development (“R&D”)\n costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer\n software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are subject to\n capitalization beginning when a product’s technological\n feasibility has been established and ending when a product is\n available for general release to customers. In most instances, the\n Company’s products are released soon after technological\n feasibility has been established and as a result software\n development costs were expensed as incurred.']
['Advertising Costs', 'Advertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred and\n included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\n Advertising expense was $1.8 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion\n for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.']
['Share-based Compensation', 'Share-based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes expense related to\n share-based payment transactions in which it receives employee\n services in exchange for (a)\xa0equity instruments of the Company\n or (b)\xa0liabilities that are based on the fair value of the\n Company’s equity instruments or that may be settled by the\n issuance of such equity instruments. Share-based compensation cost\n for restricted stock and restricted stock units\n (“RSUs”) is measured based on the closing fair market\n value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The\n Company recognizes share-based compensation cost over the\n award’s requisite service period on a straight-line basis for\n time-based RSUs and on a graded basis for RSUs that are contingent\n on the achievement of performance conditions. The Company\n recognizes a benefit from share-based compensation in the\n Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity if an excess\n tax benefit is realized. In addition, the Company recognizes the\n indirect effects of share-based compensation on R&D tax\n credits, foreign tax credits and domestic manufacturing deductions\n in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Further information\n regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9,\n “Benefit Plans.”']
['Income Taxes', 'Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes is computed using\n the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and\n liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences\n of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax\n bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax\n credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are\n measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to\n taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets\n and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The Company\n records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the\n amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.\nThe Company recognizes the tax benefit from an\n uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax\n position will be sustained on examination by the taxing\n authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax\n benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions\n are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater\n than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. See Note 5,\n “Income Taxes” for additional information.']
['Earnings Per Share', 'Earnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing\n income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average\n number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.\n Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income available\n to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of\n common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the\n number of additional shares of common stock that would have been\n outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued.\n Potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options,\n shares to be purchased under the Company’s employee stock\n purchase plan, unvested restricted stock and unvested RSUs. The\n dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in\n diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock\n method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair\n market value of the Company’s common stock can result in a\n greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities.\n\n \xa0\nThe following table shows the computation of basic\n and diluted earnings per share for 2015, 2014 and 2013 (net income\n in millions and shares in thousands):\n\n \xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n2015\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n2014\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n2013\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n Numerator:\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Net income\n\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n53,394\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n39,510\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n37,037\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n Denominator:\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Weighted-average shares outstanding\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n5,753,421\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n6,085,572\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n6,477,320\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n Effect of dilutive securities\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n39,648\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n37,091\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n44,314\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n Weighted-average diluted shares\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n5,793,069\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n6,122,663\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n6,521,634\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Basic earnings per share\n\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n9.28\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n6.49\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n5.72\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n Diluted earnings per share\n\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n9.22\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n6.45\n\xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\n$\n5.68\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\nPotentially dilutive securities whose effect would\n have been antidilutive are excluded from the computation of diluted\n earnings per share.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '2015', '', '', '2014', '', '', '2013', '', 'Numerator:', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Net income', '', '$', '53,394', '', '', '$', '39,510', '', '', '$', '37,037', '', 'Denominator:', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Weighted-average shares outstanding', '', '', '5,753,421', '', '', '', '6,085,572', '', '', '', '6,477,320', '', 'Effect of dilutive securities', '', '', '39,648', '', '', '', '37,091', '', '', '', '44,314', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Weighted-average diluted shares', '', '', '5,793,069', '', '', '', '6,122,663', '', '', '', '6,521,634', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Basic earnings per share', '', '$', '9.28', '', '', '$', '6.49', '', '', '$', '5.72', '', 'Diluted earnings per share', '', '$', '9.22', '', '', '$', '6.45', '', '', '$', '5.68', '']

['Derivative Financial Instruments', 'Derivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company accounts for its derivative instruments\n as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value.\nFor derivative instruments that hedge the exposure\n to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as\n cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the\n derivative instrument is reported as a component of AOCI in\n shareholders’ equity and reclassified into earnings in the\n same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects\n earnings.

Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are\n amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful\n lives of the assets, which range from three to five years.\n Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was\n $9.2 billion, $6.9 billion and $5.8 billion during 2015, 2014 and\n 2013, respectively.']
['Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets', 'Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired\n Intangible Assets\nThe Company reviews property, plant and equipment,\n inventory component prepayments and certain identifiable\n intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment. Long-lived assets\n are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in\n circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be\n recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by\n comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash\n flows the assets are expected to generate. If property, plant and\n equipment, inventory component prepayments and certain identifiable\n intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be\n recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the\n assets exceeds its fair value.\nThe Company does not amortize goodwill and\n intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, rather such assets\n are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or\n sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that\n the assets may be impaired. The Company performs its goodwill and\n intangible asset impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each\n year. The Company did not recognize any impairment charges related\n to goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets during 2015, 2014\n and 2013. The Company established reporting units based on its\n current reporting structure. For purposes of testing goodwill for\n impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to\n the extent it relates to each reporting unit. In 2015 and 2014, the\n Company’s goodwill was primarily allocated to the Americas\n and Europe reporting units.\nThe Company amortizes its intangible assets with\n definite useful lives over their estimated useful lives and reviews\n these assets for impairment. The Company typically amortizes its\n acquired intangible assets with definite useful lives over periods\n from three to seven years.']
['Fair Value Measurements', 'Fair Value Measurements\nThe Company applies fair value accounting for all\n financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and\n liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the\n financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair\n value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or\n paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between\n market participants at the measurement date. When determining the\n fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are\n required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the\n principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would\n transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that\n market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability,\n such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer\n restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying\n the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to\n measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization\n within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is\n available and significant to the fair value measurement:\n\nLevel 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for\n identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 – Observable inputs other than\n quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and\n liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or\n liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are\n observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for\n substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 – Inputs that are generally\n unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimate of\n assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset\n or liability.\n\n \xa0\nThe Company’s valuation techniques used to\n measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable\n equity securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets\n for identical assets or liabilities. The valuation techniques used\n to measure the fair value of the Company’s debt instruments\n and all other financial instruments, all of which have\n counterparties with high credit ratings, were valued based on\n quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant\n inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.\nIn accordance with the fair value accounting\n requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible financial\n instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company has\n not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial\n instruments.']

Gains and\n losses from these translations are recognized in foreign currency\n translation included in AOCI in shareholders’ equity. The\n Company’s subsidiaries that use the U.S. dollar as their\n functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at\n exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and\n inventories, property and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at\n historical rates.']

Company may sell certain of its marketable\n securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic reasons\n including, but not limited to, anticipation of credit deterioration\n and duration management. The maturities of the Company’s\n long-term marketable securities generally range from one to five\n years.\nAs of September\xa026, 2015, the Company\n considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities\n investment portfolio to be temporary in nature and does not\n consider any of its investments other-than-temporarily impaired.\n The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its\n investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to\n any one issuer. The policy generally requires investments to be\n investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the\n potential risk of principal loss. Fair values were determined for\n each individual security in the investment portfolio. When\n evaluating an investment for other-than-temporary impairment the\n Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to\n which fair value has been below its cost basis, the financial\n condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, changes in market\n interest rates and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether\n it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the\n investment before recovery of the investment’s cost\n basis.\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company may use derivatives to partially offset\n its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on\n expected future cash flows, on net investments in certain foreign\n subsidiaries and on certain existing assets and liabilities.\n However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for\n a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting\n considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging\n particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will\n offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from\n movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates.\nTo help protect gross margins from fluctuations in\n foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company’s\n subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar may hedge\n a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and subsidiaries\n whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar and who sell in\n local currencies may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory\n purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries’ functional\n currencies. The Company may enter into forward contracts, option\n contracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may\n designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company\n typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency\n exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically\n for up to 12 months.\nTo help protect the net investment in a foreign\n operation from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates,\n the Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option\n contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these\n investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\n In addition, the Company may use non-derivative financial\n instruments, such as its foreign currency-denominated debt, as\n economic hedges of its net investments in certain foreign\n subsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company designates these\n instruments as net investment hedges.\n\n \xa0\nThe Company may also enter into non-designated\n foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency\n exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of\n certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional\n currencies.\nThe Company may enter into interest rate swaps,\n options, or other instruments to manage interest rate risk. These\n instruments may offset a portion of changes in income or expense,\n or changes in fair value of the Company’s term debt or\n investments. The Company designates these instruments as either\n cash flow or fair value hedges. The Company’s hedged interest\n rate transactions as of September\xa026, 2015 are expected to be\n recognized within 10 years.\n\nCash Flow Hedges\nThe effective portions of cash flow hedges are\n recorded in AOCI until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.\n Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of\n foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales\n in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and\n deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory\n purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the\n same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred gains and\n losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or\n expense are recognized in other income/(expense), net in the same\n period as the related income or expense is recognized. The\n ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness\n testing of cash flow hedges are recognized in other\n income/(expense), net.\nDerivative instruments designated as cash flow\n hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the\n forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially\n identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time\n period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such\n derivative instruments are reclassified immediately into other\n income/(expense), net. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such\n derivative instruments are reflected in other income/(expense), net\n unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions.\n\nNet Investment Hedges\nThe effective portions of net investment hedges are\n recorded in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) as a\n part of the cumulative translation adjustment. The ineffective\n portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of net\n investment hedges are recognized in other income/(expense),\n net.\n\nFair Value Hedges\nGains and losses related to changes in fair value\n hedges are recognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss\n or gain related to the change in value of the underlying hedged\n item.\n\nNon-Designated Derivatives\nDerivatives that are not designated as hedging\n instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the\n financial statement line item to which the derivative relates.\nThe Company records all derivatives in the\n Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company’s\n accounting treatment for these derivative instruments is based on\n its hedge designation. The following tables show the\n Company’s derivative instruments at gross fair value as of\n September\xa026, 2015 and September\xa027, 2014 (in\n millions):\n\n

The credit risk amounts\n represent the Company’s gross exposure to potential\n accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or\n unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the\n terms of the contract, based on then-current currency or interest\n rates at each respective date. The Company’s exposure to\n credit loss and market risk will vary over time as currency and\n interest rates change. Although the table above reflects the\n notional and credit risk amounts of the Company’s derivative\n instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated\n with the exposures and transactions that the instruments are\n intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement\n of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses\n on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market\n conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.\nThe Company generally enters into master netting\n arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by\n permitting net settlement of transactions with the same\n counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally\n enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for\n collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of\n certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually\n established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets\n and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its\n Consolidated Balance Sheets. The net cash collateral received by\n the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral\n security arrangements was $1.0 billion as of September\xa026,\n 2015 and $2.1 billion as of September\xa027, 2014.\nUnder master netting arrangements with the\n respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative\n contracts, the\xa0Company is allowed to net settle transactions\n with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of\n September\xa026, 2015 and September\xa027, 2014, the potential\n effects of these rights of set-off associated with the\n Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of\n collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and\n derivative liabilities of\xa0$2.2\xa0billion and $1.6 billion,\n respectively, resulting in net derivative liabilities\n of\xa0$78\xa0million and $549 million, respectively.\n\nAccounts Receivable\n\nTrade Receivables\nThe Company has considerable trade receivables\n outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers,\n wholesalers, retailers, value-added resellers, small and mid-sized\n businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The\n Company generally does not require collateral from its customers;\n however, the Company will require collateral in certain instances\n to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company\n attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit\n insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party\n financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These\n credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party\n financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company\n generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing\n related to any of these arrangements.\nAs of September\xa026, 2015, the Company had one\n customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables,\n which accounted for 12%. As of September\xa027, 2014, the Company\n had two customers that represented 10% or more of total trade\n receivables, one of which accounted for 16% and the other 13%. The\n Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 71% and 72%\n of trade receivables as of September\xa026, 2015 and\n September\xa027, 2014, respectively.\n\nVendor Non-Trade Receivables\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain\n of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components\n to these vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final\n products for the Company. The Company purchases these components\n directly from suppliers. Vendor non-trade receivables from three of\n the Company’s vendors accounted for 38%, 18% and 14% of total\n vendor non-trade receivables as of September\xa026, 2015 and\n three of the Company’s vendors accounted for 51%, 16% and 14%\n of total vendor non-trade receivables as of September\xa027,\n 2014.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '',
